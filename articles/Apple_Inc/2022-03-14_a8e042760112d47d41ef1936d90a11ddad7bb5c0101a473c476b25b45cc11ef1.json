  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start</strong>: <strong>BlackRock</strong>, the world's largest asset manager, has taken about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7967c06-77f3-45f6-9bf5-f141f899dba5\">$17bn in losses</a> on its Russian securities holdings because of the attack on Ukraine, showing the broad impact of sanctions and closed markets.</p> <h1>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</h1> <p>Tech investor <strong>Michael Moritz</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3aa8470a-7303-4cf0-a747-43cf68a792c8\">is outraged </a>that proxy adviser <strong>Institutional Shareholder Services</strong> dared to question the $99mn that <strong>Apple</strong> planned to pay its chief executive <strong>Tim Cook</strong> for 2021. After all, total shareholder returns under Cook now exceed 1,000 per cent. The <strong>Sequoia Capital</strong> partner is even angrier that more than a third of the company's shareholders then voted against the pay and bonus package at its annual meeting last month.</p> <p>In Moritz's view, that proves that ISS has too much power and shareholders are too willing to follow its advice. He wrote in this week's FT opinion section that “ISS's opinions are about as credible as those rendered by <strong>Moody's</strong>, <strong>Standard &amp; Poor</strong>'s and <strong>Fitch</strong> before the 2008 subprime crisis” because the service sells advice on too many companies and offers so many other services that its views are inherently conflicted. In practice, it is both “judge and jury for the actions of the corporate world,” says Moritz.</p> <p>He is not the only one. Industry groups representing big companies have long moaned that&#xa0;recommendations from ISS and rival <strong>Glass Lewis</strong> carry too much weight with shareholders when it comes to proxy votes on pay, the environment and other controversial issues, writes my colleague <em>Brooke Masters </em>in New York. They say they want fund managers to do their own research, but some clearly long for the days when investors simply rubber-stamped management decisions.</p> <p>During <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s administration, corporate lobbyists convinced the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> to adopt <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d4fea3d-a250-4325-92fc-955c7444f383\">new restrictions</a> on proxy advisers. But the current chair <strong>Gary Gensler</strong> has turned the tables, saying <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd962367-b92c-4f37-9355-47f35aaf573d\">last summer</a> that his SEC will not enforce those rules and may instead rewrite them.</p> <p>That leaves ISS free to sell advice, and shareholders free to take it. Or not. Cook got his money after all, which suggests that most Apple investors felt able to make their own calls.</p> <p>Are the proxy advisers inherently conflicted?

Could they now find themselves on the wrong side of a painful bear market?</p> <p>“<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1d1c558-9a87-4843-9cd8-29ab203b7911\">Tiger cubs</a>” such as <strong>Chase Coleman</strong>'s <strong>Tiger Global</strong> and <strong>Philippe Laffont</strong>'s <strong>Coatue Management</strong> have had the perfect strategy to profit from the lengthy equity bull market — pick companies that may appear expensive on traditional valuation metrics but which boast impressive growth prospects.</p> <p>That has earned them knockout profits — such as Coatue's 65 per cent gain in 2020 — and placed them among the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d106227-d6e7-4ea2-9772-abb0da694e70\">best-performing</a> managers of all time. Hefty portfolios of private companies have also helped and given them early access to some of the most exciting tech companies around.</p> <p>Coleman's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54bb342c-230f-4438-a4d7-7cbde010ea1a\">Tiger Global</a> epitomises their success. The group has come a long way since it started life in early 2001 in Tiger Management‘s offices, growing to manage a staggering $90bn in assets. The velocity at which its vast private equity business, which makes roughly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1dcdda5a-9274-4519-9a5f-c460b8e1b251\">one investment a day</a>, puts money to work is changing the face of the venture capital industry. And now its partners are <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiger-global-partners-commit-1-billion-for-early-stage-tech-funds?utm_source=ti_app\">investing</a> $1bn of their own money into funds that back the youngest start-ups, to give the fund exposure to companies it could invest in later, <em>The Information</em> recently reported.</p> <p>But times may have changed. Rising borrowing costs are putting pressure on companies with little in the way of current earnings — a “wicked, wicked punishment” for “jam tomorrow” companies, says veteran hedge fund investor <strong>Dixon Boardman</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Optima Asset Management</strong>.</p> <p>That is hitting some of the cubs, a number of whom have backed a similar group of tech stocks, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4af5c796-b8a5-4046-baf4-c9c7411929c2\">this analysis</a> by <em>Laurence Fletcher</em> and <em>Akila Quinio</em>. The chart below illustrates the scope of their overlap:</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8732989.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Amid a sell-off in tech stocks this year, many Tiger cubs have been left nursing losses. Some stocks have proved particularly painful. Funds including Tiger Global, Coatue and <strong>D1</strong> have been backers of connected fitness company <strong>Peloton Interactive</strong>, whose shares have tumbled from more than $170 early last year to less than $25. Product recalls, missed targets and a Peloton bike's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3693cfe-ad2a-44d5-a447-46fc4edf6937\">ill-fated cameo appearance</a> in the <em>Sex and the City </em>reboot have not helped.</p> <p>Now investors are asking questions about the Tiger cubs' venture capital positions and how they are valued. If the bear market in tech has further to run, and privately held positions have further to fall, then the “wicked, wicked punishment” could last for some time.</p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>China's leading stainless steel producer is at the centre of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0269cdda-ef67-43c8-b820-a919c919b5fa\">surge in nickel prices</a>, after its wager that the price would fall collided with a rally in the metal sparked by the war in Ukraine, resulting in a vicious short squeeze and forcing it to buy contracts linked to the metal in huge volumes. Nickel prices briefly rose above a record $100,000 a tonne on Tuesday as banks and brokers rushed to close part of a huge position amassed by <strong>Xiang Guangda</strong>, the billionaire founder of China's leading stainless steel producer <strong>Tsingshan Holding Group</strong>.
