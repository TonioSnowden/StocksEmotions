  "text": "<p>In a parallel universe, British telecoms company Three would by now be celebrating the fruits of becoming the country's largest mobile phone network.</p> <p>It is a trick that CK Hutchison, its Hong Kong parent company, has pulled off in Italy, Austria and Ireland. Tycoon Li Ka-shing's conglomerate showed that four can easily become three when it consolidated those markets.</p> <p>But it has failed to achieve the same result in the UK. The British arm of the Three brand was forced to abort its £10.25bn takeover of Telefónica's O2 network after European regulators scuppered the deal in 2016.</p> <p>Instead Three's status as the smallest of four main players has endured some 18 years after its launch. It has remained on the sidelines as rival EE was absorbed by BT, while former target O2 is on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac9a6a1a-02e4-4236-ab74-6bd033ea3104\">cusp of merging</a> with Virgin Media. </p> <p>Hutchison is one of the most active investors in the UK with assets ranging from power grids to Northumbrian Water and the Superdrug pharmacy chain. But five years on from the collapse of the O2 deal it faces the conundrum of what to do with a mobile asset into which it has poured more than £13bn but which remains the runt of the market. </p> <p>Three, having spent its formative years defining itself in an increasingly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tYyMv0mIM4\">inane manner</a>, wants to widen the appeal of its brand.</p> <p>Robert Finnegan, a company veteran who took over as chief executive a year ago, said the company needed to expand its reach to a market of more than 40m potential customers, compared to the 17m-strong market of younger and low-spending consumers that have been its traditional base. </p> <p>Its overall market share is only about 14 per cent of contract customers compared with 36 per cent for EE with Vodafone and O2 controlling about a quarter of the market, according to Enders Analysis. </p> <p>“We are moving away from the edgy, zany approach to a wider broader appeal,” Finnegan said. The company is set to relaunch in the summer having hired Wonderhood Studios, the television and advertising company founded by former Channel 4 head David Abraham, to better take on rivals in the mass market. It has also begun sponsoring the shirts of Chelsea football club to raise its profile.</p> <p>The refresh for the 5G age has come at more cost. It is investing £2bn in improving its network and IT systems, having earmarked the business telecoms market and smart home connectivity as areas for expansion. Capital expenditure rose 79 per cent to £764m in 2020 and it also spent £280m in the UK's recent 5G spectrum auction.</p> <p>“Three has been a challenger brand, but we need to move away from fighting with everybody and standing in the corner on a soapbox and giving out about all sorts of things,” he said, nodding to its bellicose attitude toward lobbying rivals and regulators in the past.</p> <p>Challenger brands including Iliad in Italy, Reliance in India and Rakuten in Japan have aggressively grown market share by offering budget prices for mobile services. </p> <p>But that was never the plan with Three. It secured spectrum in the UK's record-breaking £22.5bn auction and was the first mover in the race to offer 3G services when it launched on the third of March 2003. </p> <p>The date was symbolic for the company, which hoped to attract millions of high-paying customers with the promise of video calling, fast data downloads and futuristic handsets capable of functions unheard of at the time.</p> <p>Yet Three racked up more than £3bn of pre-tax losses by 2005 and gained a reputation for terrible service — both customer and network — with clunky handsets that were neither desirable or particularly functional.</p> <p>It was O2 that took the lion's share of 3G smartphone profits after winning an exclusive deal to sell the iPhone in 2007. Three was instead forced to adopt a ‘‘challenger'' ethos focusing on bargain hunting customers.</p> <p>The reset and significant cost cutting meant by 2012 it was turning a profit and, with its business on a more stable footing, Hutchison launched its fruitless attempt to buy O2 three years later. </p> <p>A former executive at the company said that it had been on “an emotional rollercoaster” since the deal was blocked. “The team was geared up to go from the smallest to the biggest. You have had to lift people from that low,” he said.</p> <p>Three battled on but the strain started to show. Its active customer base fell to 9.7m from 10.3m last year. Revenue dropped 1 per cent to £2.4bn while earnings before interest and taxation declined 22 per cent to £553m. </p> <p>There has been wholesale change at the top of the company with the previous chief executive and heads of commercial, strategy, technology and marketing all leaving the company in quick succession last year. Finnegan was promoted from running the Irish division to breathing life into the UK business. </p> <p>“This time we're not just talking about the fight, we're getting into it,” he said, acknowledging that the company has long talked about the potential of the business market. </p> <p>The O2 decision still rankles however. Finnegan is quick to point out that the General Court of the EU last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c5e79ec-d7e1-4031-a923-d8327a503761\">annulled the decision</a> to block the acquisition. Finnegan led the takeover of O2 in Ireland, a separate deal that preceded the failed UK attempt, and argues that it is consumers that have ultimately lost out due to lower investment and poorer quality networks. </p> <p>“I am not sure the quality of the communications infrastructure in the UK is of a standard befitting the UK. The investment put in by the operators is diluted over too many networks,” he said.</p> <p>He describes the British market as “dysfunctional” and worries that regulators are still obsessed with “quantity not quality” when viewing the market structure. “Maybe there is a mindset that needs to be shifted in the bowels of Ofcom,” he said. </p> <p>Karen Egan, an analyst with Enders, said Three “seems to be between a rock and a hard place — too small scale to earn a decent return and with a very challenging trajectory towards achieving the scale it needs to improve those returns”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet options for consolidation now look limited with Sky and TalkTalk seen as unlikely bedfellows given Three's mobile focus in other markets. Analysts have speculated that Three could merge with Vodafone's UK arm but there is currently no real appetite to forge such an alliance, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the strategy of the two companies. </p> <p>Vodafone and Hutchison forged a similar deal in Australia last decade but struggled to make the partnership work. </p> <p>In lieu of a deal, Finnegan has little choice but to force the 18-year-old company to finally grow up. </p><p>Source: Nic Fildes 2021 'Three aims to grow up and get past fourth place in 5G era ' FT.com 29 March.
