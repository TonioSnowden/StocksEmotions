  "text": "<p>“Things are so unpredictable and stressful,” Kurtzig told MarketWatch. “There is a state of emergency, with restrictions on travel, a ban on strikes. We are so worried about the safety of our people.” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later declared martial law and ordered “anyone with military experience must report.”</p><p>For Kurtzig, who runs the roughly 1,000-person online-advice platform from San Francisco, managing a 260-person workforce in Ukraine has been a harrowing experience. Sleep deprived for the past two weeks, he and his staff have worked on plans to protect employees while maintaining operations.</p><p>It is a scene being repeated at other technology companies with major operations in Ukraine. Officials at Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGLGOOG, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Snap Inc. SNAP and Oracle Corp. ORCL are confronted with the task of doing business during all-out war.</p><p>In a LinkedIn post, Grammarly CEO Brad Hoover said his machine learning and artificial intelligence company, founded in Ukraine, “remains committed to Ukraine” and that it is still hiring. “While we hope for the best, we have also prepared for the worst,” he wrote. “That includes having contingency plans for various scenarios, along with financial and logistical assistance to better support our team members and their families in getting to safety.”</p><p>The geopolitical shock event has already ravaged markets, battering most stocks. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, however, believes “top names to own on this sell off in our opinion are Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Oracle, Adobe ADBE, Salesforce CRM, as well as core chip names which should be safety plays in this turmoil.”</p><p>That comes as little solace for smaller companies with significant investments in Ukraine.</p><p>“No amount of reassurance supersedes intrinsic fear,” Canvas CEO Kevin Stephens told MarketWatch. His app company, which employs a handful of contract workers in Kharkiv, saw the apprehension in a Zoom call. “I am concerned for their safety.”</p><p>Read more: Tech employers in Ukraine are preparing for the worst, including using crypto in lieu of cash</p><p>JustAnswer's four-point business continuity plan covers personal safety, through relocation of people and extended personal time off; infrastructure backup in the form of backup diesel generators, laptops and internet service in Ukraine; business as usual, in the event employees go off to war; and response to the escalation, through financial support and first aid training.</p><p>Kurtzig added that JustAnswer has contacted its bank in Ukraine, which was recently attacked digitally, to ensure its employees have access to funds.</p><p>It is likely to get worse, as the Russian army descends on major cities and escalates cyberattacks on critical infrastructure like water and electricity, explains Marco Bellin, CEO of Datacappy, a combination virtual private network and private browser.</p><p>Employers are encouraging staff to leave the country, if possible, with their financial assistance. Some, however, remain reluctant to leave.</p><p>“The majority still wanted to think about it,” Stephens said. “Why are they reluctant to leave? Their families are there, and it's patriotism.”</p>",
