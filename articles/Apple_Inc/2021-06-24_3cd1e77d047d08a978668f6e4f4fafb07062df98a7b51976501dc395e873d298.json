  "text": "<p>\n  HONG KONG </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Dissident Newspaper </p><p>\n  Prints Last Edition </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Apple Daily, Hong Kong's defiant pro-democracy newspaper that drew the ire of China's leaders, said it would print its final issue Thursday, ending an era of unfettered reporting critical of Beijing in the city's mainstream print scene. </p><p>\n  The 26-year-old newspaper, which is majority-owned by jailed Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, has come under pressure from Hong Kong authorities, who in the past week froze company assets, seized journalists' computers and charged two of its top executives under a national security law that was imposed by Beijing last year to crush dissent. </p><p>\n  Apple Daily said it would run its last print edition Thursday and stop updating its website, citing employee safety and staffing issues. </p><p>\n  -- Elaine Yu </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  IRAN </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Attack on Nuclear </p><p>\n  Facility Was Foiled </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Iran said Wednesday it foiled an attempt to sabotage a facility belonging to its atomic agency near the capital, the latest attack on its nuclear program and one that follows the election of a hard-line cleric as president. </p><p>\n  Saboteurs targeted the building in Karaj, west of Tehran, earlier in the day but were thwarted, according to Iran's semiofficial Tasnim news agency. Iranian authorities didn't say what the building contained. </p><p>\n  -- Sune Engel Rasmussen </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  BRAZIL </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Environment Minister </p><p>\n  Resigns Amid Probe </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles resigned Wednesday, weeks after he was targeted by federal police as part of an investigation into alleged illegal logging in the Amazon rainforest. </p><p>\n  Mr. Salles, widely criticized by environmental activists over rising deforestation, will be replaced by Joaquim Alvaro Pereira Leite, an official previously in charge of monitoring the Amazon. </p><p>\n  The departing minister had led Brazil's recent efforts to try to persuade the U.S. to pay it $1 billion to help it combat deforestation and finance sustainable development. Those plans were thrown into disarray last month when federal police raided properties linked to Mr. Salles as part of a probe into alleged illegal chopping of trees for export. He has denied the accusations. </p><p>\n  -- Samantha Pearson </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  CANADA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Indigenous Group </p><p>\n  Finds More Graves </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  An indigenous community in western Canada said it found hundreds of unmarked graves near a former boarding school less than a month after a similar discovery shocked the country and reignited a nationwide discussion about Canada's treatment of indigenous people. </p><p>\n  The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, said it would provide more details during a Thursday press conference alongside the Cowessess First Nation. </p><p>\n  The announcement comes several weeks after the Tk'emlups te Secwepemc First Nation near Kamloops, British Columbia, said it had discovered the remains of 215 children in the area of a former government-funded boarding school. </p><p>\n  -- Kim Mackrael </p><p></p>",
