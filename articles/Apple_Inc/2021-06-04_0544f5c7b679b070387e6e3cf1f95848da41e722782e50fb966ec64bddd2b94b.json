  "text": "<p>   Apple Inc. is telling office staff to prepare to return to the workplace at least most of the time, joining the growing pool of companies adopting hybrid work. </p><p>   Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, in an email to staff, told office employees that they are expected to return to their workspace three days a week starting in September. The iPhone maker said it wants most office workers to show up Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, with the option to work remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays. </p><p>   Technology news outlet The Verge earlier reported the back-to-office plans. </p><p>   Apple already has gradually been reopening its retail stores around the world. In March, all of its 270 U.S. retail outlets welcomed back shoppers. In his note to employees, Mr. Cook said all stores in other markets would open their doors again by the end of the month. </p><p>   Companies across industries are adopting plans to go back to the office, but many offering staff greater flexibility than pre-pandemic. </p><p>   Alphabet Inc.'s Google last month notified employees of its hybrid work plans, with employees going into an office three days a week and some likely to work remotely permanently. Microsoft Corp. in March said it was welcoming employees back to its headquarters, while offering them the ability to work from the office or home. </p><p>   Hybrid-work arrangements are becoming not just a way of working for some companies, but in some cases an opportunity, fueling appetite for tools and equipment to facilitate having some employees in the office while others work remotely. Zoom Video Communications Inc. this week reported surging sales for some of the tools it offers to facilitate hybrid work. </p><p></p>",
