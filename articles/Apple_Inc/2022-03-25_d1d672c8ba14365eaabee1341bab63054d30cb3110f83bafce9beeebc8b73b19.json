  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>Today's announcement that the US would increase supplies of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de704c90-dc68-4747-86ef-551f1ffbcb04\">liquefied natural gas</a> to Europe is the latest proposal to help wean the west off its dependence on Russian energy.</p> <p>The additional 15bn cubic metres of LNG, some from the US itself and some from swaps arranged with other countries, would, president Joe Biden insisted, “increase energy security, economic security and national security”. He added: “I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe. But it's not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it's going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing.”</p> <p>Germany said it would wean itself off Russian gas by mid-2024 as well as becoming “virtually independent” of Russian oil by the end of this year, although chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier this week stood firm against an immediate ban on Russian fossil fuels, warning it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c95634ad-e01a-4af5-b7e8-4616618b7431\">trigger a recession</a>. More than half of the gas and coal that it imports come from Russia, as does a third of its oil.</p> <p>The issue of soaring energy prices is also rapidly moving up domestic policy agendas. The German government yesterday set out a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14958006-d7a7-4a8f-80e1-2f6e594cd832\">€16bn package of aid</a> to counter soaring costs, while UK chancellor Rishi Sunak hinted at more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02b54b19-0538-45f9-9ea5-eb855352ece3\">help for consumers</a> in the autumn after being pilloried for doing little to help struggling families in Wednesday's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1f556de-b8e9-400f-a557-c9e8f32461b5\">Spring Statement</a>.</p> <p>Governments are also scrambling to diversify and ramp up efforts in sustainable energy. UK prime minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he wanted to deliver <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f97ffa0c-adce-4657-b37d-840b21f3b628\">new nuclear power stations</a> at “warp speed” with the aim of providing at least a quarter of electricity generation by 2050. </p> <p>Johnson hopes to publish a new energy supply strategy next week which would remove the need for Russian oil and gas and reduce the UK's exposure to volatile commodity markets. He is also keen to increase output from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c958f6b-2f71-4a86-97eb-97c71434df1d\">North Sea</a>, a move that has attracted criticism from climate campaigners, although he said it would not derail efforts to cut net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Global moves to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c96a9c76-d9bf-4d43-9b1c-65268ec509ba\">revive coal mining</a> have attracted similar ire from campaigners. </p> <p>Removing supplies of Russian oil into Europe would lead to a lasting reshaping of global energy markets. Oil traders warned this week that the price of crude could top <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1643ba16-4e80-40cb-a983-7f57003945bc\">$200 a barrel</a> this year if boycotts gather pace while alternative sources are yet to solidify, and central banks are unlikely to offer immediate support to ease <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/567bebdb-6ebe-414f-9e57-d8aac819ba63\">strains in the market</a>.</p> <p>Commercial relationships will also be difficult to disentangle.
