  "title": "Arts in Review -- Theater Review: 'Ulysses' From Molly's Eyes",
  "text": "<p>Throughout the pandemic, New York's Irish Repertory Theatre has been setting the standard for theatrical webcasts in America. Now all nine of the shows that the company presented in 2020 are being replayed in rotating repertory -- four times each -- as part of its Theatre @ Home Winter Festival. I reviewed most of them with high enthusiasm during their original runs, but \"Yes! Reflections of Molly Bloom,\" a revival of Aedin Moloney's one-woman show adapted by her and the Irish novelist Colum McCann from James Joyce's \"Ulysses,\" inexplicably got past me. It is an unmixed pleasure to catch up with it now. Ms. Moloney is one of the Irish Rep's most gifted actors -- I have reviewed her in several of that great company's productions, including its unforgettable 2011 revival of Brian Friel's \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" -- and I didn't see a more impressive individual performance by anyone last year.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with \"Ulysses,\" it is Joyce's masterpiece, a long, famously complex novel based on Homer's \"Odyssey.\" First published in its entirety in 1922, its subject is an ordinary day in the life of Dublin's Leopold Bloom and those who know him, and what results is what Edmund Wilson called \"a work of high genius. . . . the most faithful X-ray ever taken of the ordinary human consciousness.\" Among those present are Molly, Bloom's wife, who in the last section of the novel, an extended soliloquy from which \"Yes!\" is drawn (it runs for an hour and 15 intermission-free minutes when performed), blissfully recounts her sexual history. Joyce's unpunctuated run-on sentences, though resistant to the eye, explode into life when read aloud or -- better still -- acted by an artist like Ms. Moloney, who was born and raised in Dublin and whose accent is as Irish as a triple shot of Jameson.</p><p>Ms. Moloney performs \"Yes!\" in an all-white Miami bedroom and its adjacent bathroom, and her performance, recorded on an iPhone by Fernando Garcia, is gorgeously lyrical, superlatively well-sustained, and a riot of sensuality, especially in the oft-quoted closing section, which she turns into something close to verbal music: \"I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.\"</p><p>In addition to being an actor, Ms. Moloney is an accomplished dancer (Mr. Garcia is her partner) and moves with lithe, uninhibited grace throughout the small performing space. Not having seen \"Yes!\" in a theater, I can't say how it plays there, but I suspect that it loses little or nothing from being viewed in the home, partly because of Mr. Garcia's flowing, graceful camerawork (you'd never guess that he used an iPhone) and partly because the you-are-there intimacy of the presentation is enhanced by viewing the show in solitude and listening on earphones. It helps enormously that it is accompanied by the music of Paddy Moloney -- Ms. Moloney's father and leader of the Chieftains, a traditional Irish band -- who has written a richly atmospheric score ideally suited to text and performance alike.</p><p>If you're at all prudish about sexual matters, be warned that there was a reason why the sale of \"Ulysses\" was banned in the U.S. from 1920 to 1933. Even now, the audio portion of Ms. Moloney's performance is, as they say, not safe for work. But it is high art all the same, and it will enthrall and transport you.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Teachout, the Journal's drama critic, is the author of \"Satchmo at the Waldorf.\" Write to him at tteachout@wsj.com.</p>",
