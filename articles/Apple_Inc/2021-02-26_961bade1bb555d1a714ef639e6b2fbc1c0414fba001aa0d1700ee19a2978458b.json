  "title": "MANSION  ---  The Market:  Wall Street Leaves New York  ---  The Covid pandemic is accelerating the flight of financial executives from Manhattan to Florida and elsewhere  ----  By Katherine Clarke and Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   Three Manhattan listings -- a downtown penthouse asking $39.5 million, a sprawling co-op seeking $40 million and a pair of Upper West Side condos on the market for $25 million -- share one thing in common. Their sellers are among the top brass at Elliott Management, a hedge fund that announced last year it is moving its headquarters from New York City to Florida. </p><p>   Real-estate veterans and hedge-fund executives believe a seismic shift is under way, one that is moving vast amounts of Wall Street wealth from New York to South Florida. For the past several years, Wall Street has been colonizing the Sunshine State, attracted to more favorable tax policies and sunnier climes. And the momentum is only accelerating amid the pandemic. </p><p>   David S. Goodboy, founder of the Palm Beach Hedge Fund Association, a networking organization for finance professionals in South Florida, said he saw his base of paying members almost triple in the past year. When he scheduled an in-person networking event in January at the West Palm Beach home of one of the organization's wealthy members in January, he said he was shocked to get 300 RSVPs. </p><p>   \"It's gone into overdrive,\" he said. \"There was always a migration, but Covid gave people a reason just beyond just taxes. It pushed them over the edge.\" </p><p>   At the same time, some wealthy financiers are trying to unload their homes in New York. Moves by high-net worth financiers are closely watched, particularly in light of predictions of a looming budget crisis in New York. The fate of the new listings may also be a bellwether for the Manhattan luxury market, which got hammered by Covid-19 in 2020 but has begun to show some signs of life in the past several months. </p><p>   \"If you think of New York City as a ballet, right now the city is at intermission,\" said real-estate agent Jason Haber at Warburg Realty. \"During intermission, some people get restless and don't come back for the next act. That's what's happening now.\" </p><p>   One of those listings is at the Four Seasons Residences at 30 Park Place, a slim tower in the Financial District that was designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects. Asking $39.5 million, it is owned by Jesse Cohn, a partner at Elliott who, as head of its U.S. activism practice, has led campaigns at Twitter and AT&amp;T. </p><p>   Mr. Cohn, who is in his early 40s, bought the apartment in 2017 for $30 million, records show, and the listing shows it has since been renovated. Mr. Cohn plans to live near Elliott's new West Palm Beach headquarters, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Farther north on the Upper West Side, Elliott Management's Co-CEO Jonathan Pollock has listed a pair of apartments at the Apthorp building, a local landmark, for a combined $25 million, according to public records and StreetEasy. </p><p>   Mr. Pollock and his wife paid about $14 million for the two apartments in 2010, records show. His agent, Sherry A. Matays of the Corcoran Group, didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Pollock has been living in the West Palm Beach area, the people said. </p><p>   Paul Singer, Elliott's founder and a noted kingmaker for Republican political candidates, has also listed his own apartment. Located on the Upper West Side in the Beresford building, another local landmark whose residents have included comedian Jerry Seinfeld, the unit listed for $40 million in September, according to property records and listing website StreetEasy. </p><p>   The 15-room, roughly 7,500-square-foot apartment, a classic co-op with sprawling views over Central Park, has a wood-paneled library and office and a room devoted to wine storage, according to the listing. The billionaire plans to primarily live outside of New York state but remain in the Northeast, the people said. </p><p>   Other hedge-fund executives decamping to Florida include billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who relocated to his home on Miami's exclusive Indian Creek Village island with his wife in 2019 before formally moving his firm from Manhattan to a modern office tower north of Miami. </p><p>   Meanwhile, Mr. Icahn's Manhattan apartment, a penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street, is still on the market after more than a year and has undergone a price cut from $35 million to $30 million, StreetEasy shows. </p><p>   The departure of Mr. Icahn feels like the end of an era. The financier, who moved into the building in the 1980s, was known for extending dinner invitations to the chief executives of companies he targeted for lagging performance. </p><p>   Over the years, Mr. Icahn's guest list included computer-titan Michael Dell and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple CEO Tim Cook was served sugar cookies shaped like Apple's logo at the end of a three-hour meal, during which Mr. Icahn pressed him to return capital to shareholders. </p><p>   In comparison, Mr. Singer keeps a significantly lower profile. He occasionally could be seen walking near Central Park's Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, which is a few short blocks from his apartment. </p><p>   While prices are under pressure in New York amid an oversupply of high-end condominiums on the market, price tags in Palm Beach and Miami appear to be on an unstoppable upward trajectory. </p><p>   Last week, private-equity executive Scott Shleifer, a co-founder of Tiger Global Management, paid over $120 million for an oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, setting a price record for the state. New Jersey hedge-fund executive David Tepper is also in contract to buy a $73 million house on the ocean nearby, The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>   While he maintains a $238 million home in New York and another luxury condo in Chicago, Citadel founder Ken Griffin has also been on an acquisition spree in South Florida, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy land in Palm Beach and Miami, and is opening an office in Miami. </p><p>   Some Manhattan-based luxury agents said they see the shift as temporary. While New York inevitably loses some of its older wealthy tax base to Florida each year, younger people are more likely to want to return once the pandemic is under control, they say. </p><p>   \"What's there to do in Florida? It's great if you're a golfer or you want to play tennis, but it's a cultural wasteland,\" said real-estate agent Donna Olshan. </p><p></p>",
