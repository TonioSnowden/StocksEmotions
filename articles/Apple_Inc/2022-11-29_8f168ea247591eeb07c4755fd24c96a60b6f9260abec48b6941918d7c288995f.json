  "title": "World News: Hong Kong Asks China to Intervene in Lai Case",
  "text": "<p>Within three hours of the ruling, Mr. Lee said he would submit a report to Beijing requesting the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top lawmaking body, to offer their interpretation and clarification on the national security law on the admission of foreign lawyers. An NPC decision would have more weight than the top court's ruling.</p><p>The court's decision was a legal setback for the city's authorities, which have been conducting a crackdown on political opponents since the law was imposed by China in June 2020, following mass and sometimes violent antigovernment protests in the city the year before.</p><p>Mr. Lai, the 74-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, was scheduled to stand trial Thursday on charges that he conspired to collude with foreign countries by lobbying the international community and foreign governments to impose sanctions on China. Mr. Lai was a key figure in the protests against China's tightening of its authority over the city, which Beijing had earlier promised would be allowed to keep its colonial-era rights and freedoms until 2047. The trial is now likely to be delayed.</p><p>Hong Kong has a long-held common law tradition of allowing British lawyers to be admitted to the city's justice system to act either for defendants or the government. Its top court has several overseas judges who can be invited to join panels presiding over appeal cases.</p><p>Mr. Lai's lawyers declined to comment on the government's move.</p><p>Hong Kong's effort to seek Beijing's help in overturning the legal ruling is an \"embarrassment\" for the top court, said Eric Lai, a research fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law.</p><p>It delivers a blow to the court's independence, which has always been fragile given Beijing's record in handing down interpretations of the city's laws, he added.</p><p>The last time Beijing overruled a Court of Final Appeal decision was in 1999, two years after the city's handover to China from the U.K., when it issued an interpretation that barred those born in the mainland from obtaining the right of abode in Hong Kong unless one of their parents were already permanent residents. Since then, Beijing has given its interpretation of the city's laws four more times, but those didn't involve overturning the top court's decisions.</p><p>In the case of Mr. Lai, government lawyers failed to persuade the five Court of Final Appeal judges to block British lawyer Timothy Owen from representing the media figure.</p><p>The lawyers had argued foreign counsel aren't suitable to handle most national security cases as the law originated from the laws of mainland China, and not the common-law system Hong Kong or British lawyers operate in.</p><p>They also contended that it would be impossible to ensure that overseas counsels appearing in national security cases will keep state secrets from trials confidential once they leave the city.</p><p>The judges refused the government the right to appeal a lower-court rejection, saying the arguments hadn't been presented at the previous hearings.</p><p>Seeking Beijing's interpretation will have no impact on the role of overseas judges or foreign nationals currently practicing as lawyers in the city, Mr. Lee added. People in Hong Kong will continue to have their basic right in their choice of legal representation as long as these are lawyers already qualified to practice in the city, he added.</p><p>In 2021, the Hong Kong government hired senior British barrister David Perry to prosecute Mr. Lai and other prominent pro-democracy activists in a separate case related to the 2019 mass protests. Mr. Perry withdrew from the case following \"pressure and criticism from the U.K. community,\" the government said at the time.</p>",
