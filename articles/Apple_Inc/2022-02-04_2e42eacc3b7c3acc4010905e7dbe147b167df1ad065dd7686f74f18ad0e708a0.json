  "title": "Oh what a lovely pandemic — for the rich",
  "text": "<p>Early into Covid, I had a Zoom cocktail with the wealthiest person I know. He's worth somewhere close to a billion dollars. He mentioned in passing that his family office (which manages the family's wealth) was applying for a Paycheck Protection Program loan from the US Small Business Administration. My ears pricked up. </p> <p>I had naively assumed that the loans, which were essentially grants, had been carefully designed to keep people in jobs — America's equivalent of Europe's employment subsidy programmes. I was being naive. As this <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29669/w29669.pdf\">National Bureau of Economic Research paper</a> found, most of the $800bn in PPP money distributed by Washington went to owners and creditors. Barely a third went to keep people in jobs. </p> <p>Many of you will recall the public outcry over the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2020/07/06/billionaire-kanye-wests-yeezy-received-a-multimillion-dollar-ppp-loan/?sh=53d82ee86a03\">Kanye Wests</a>, <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/12/04/tom-brady-company-tb12-ppp-loan\">Tom Bradys</a> and other celebrities who availed of DC's largesse. What we may not have fully digested is how easy it was for the wealthy in general to game the system. Indeed, it seemed almost designed to be that way. Those with pre-existing bank credit lines tended to qualify. Those without did not. That's one way of sorting the deserving from the undeserving — though of course the outcome was mostly the wrong way round.</p> <p>A few days after our virtual drink, I asked my friend whether I could report on the mechanisms by which his family office would qualify for so much free money — but without mentioning names. He said he had reconsidered and decided the process was more trouble than it was worth.</p> <p>I mention this because my friend, who is a wonderful human being, but who has somewhat different political views than me, saw no problem with wealthy people getting free money but has strong objections&#xa0;to higher taxes. Though I have not asked him, I suspect he is alarmed by signs of rising US wage inflation. The pandemic has been a bonanza for people in his income bracket. According to numerous different yardsticks, the year <a href=\"https://realtimeinequality.org/\">2021 was the best on record for the super wealthy</a> — their net worth rose more than in any single year recorded. The previous year was almost as good.</p> <p>As a result, US income inequality is now close to its highest ever. Much of what has driven this is the lockdown-spurred boom in tech company valuations, which has supercharged the fortunes of people like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, in spite of the recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e80d420-ee96-4b2e-a58c-ed323d93ba74\">nosedive in Meta's share price</a>. The Federal Reserve has also fuelled the asset-owning classes with its extraordinary programme of quantitative easing (that will be withdrawn in the coming months). “Credit” should also go to Congress, which has so far proved unable to enact even the modest tax increases Joe Biden requested. I note with genuine concern that the 15 per cent global corporate minimum tax is also in danger. This would be one of Biden's biggest achievements and would go some way towards making globalisation less easy to rig for the world's most powerful companies.</p> <p>Compared to these drivers, the misdirected PPP payouts were almost trivial — at least in total dollars. In ethical terms, though, PPP captured what is rotten in American capitalism. The gulf between the self-image of many wealthy Americans and the reality of how so many became rich is shocking to me. Few fit the Steve Jobs rags-to-riches profile of starting with nothing and making a fortune through their own ingenuity.</p> <p>Though today's rich are hard-working compared to the dissolute aristocracies of yore, many inherited the financial and social assets that have made them even richer. Yet even the liberal ones I know believe they are morally entitled to what they have — and that any legal ruse (of which Washington offers approximately infinity) is justified to avoid paying taxes. They thus implicitly endorse the other side of the coin, which is that those without means are in some way deserving of their fate. If I had my druthers, I would mandate that every wealthy American <a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/07/frank-luck-looms-larger-success-most-us-think\">read Robert Frank's gem</a>: <em>Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy</em>. It is impossible to read this wise, limpid and impeccably researched book and think that capitalism today is either fair or efficient. We live in a world of socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.</p> <p>Rana, I know you strongly agree with this diagnosis. And I know that both of us know people who would be happy to pay higher taxes if they felt they were fairly and transparently implemented. Everyone wants to minimise their tax bill — it's only human. But some would be happy to pay more if they knew that even richer people would not somehow find a way out of it, as they always seem to do. So my question to you is how we persuade the super wealthy that it is in their interests to be less evasive . . . and indeed, to understand from history that extreme inequality will eventually jeopardise what they have. They can't all flee to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-19/-we-needed-to-go-rich-americans-activate-pandemic-escape-plans\">bunkers in New Zealand</a>.</p> <h1>Recommended reads </h1> <ul>  <li><p>My column this week looks at how <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d67a8e43-8edb-4f1d-8cd8-168539e07598\">Vladimir Putin has overplayed his hand</a>. “By demanding concessions that have shocked a divided and rudderless Europe, Putin has united the west behind US leadership. It has been years since that sentence could be written with a straight face.”&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Even if you are uninterested in the fate of Afghanistan, I urge you in any case to read this <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/biden-afghanistan-exit-american-allies-abandoned/621307/\">devastating Atlantic essay by George Packer</a> on the Afghans who were left behind. It's hard to read this meticulously researched piece without feeling deep anger at the betrayal of the people who risked their lives to work for America. The manner in which Biden withdrew from the country, and his indifference to those left behind, remains the biggest strike against his presidency.</p></li>  <li><p>Rana, I thought you wrote a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59321a73-5f88-4e94-9aa2-62e4927783b1\">great piece</a> on the toll of automation on inequality — a related theme to today's note. Our colleagues Martin Wolf, on how the Fed is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35ce0c88-48a7-46cc-8f2f-51c69632f43e\">too late to remove the punchbowl</a>, and Gideon Rachman, on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da08b08c-eac3-4586-abe3-c3691cb54f44\">international cult of Vladimir Putin</a>, were also well worth reading.</p></li>  <li><p>Finally, highly attentive/insomniac/clinically depressed Swampians might recall that I'm researching a biography of Zbigniew Brzezinski, the late US foreign policy grand strategist. I'll be on leave over the next six weeks to accelerate that genuinely gripping research. My esteemed colleagues Peter Spiegel, Gideon Rachman and Richard Waters will be filling in for me over that time. Doubtless they will put me to shame.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Rana Foroohar responds </h1> <p>Let me start by saying that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c98362f0-6aa4-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3\">I was concerned</a> from the very beginning of the pandemic that without stricter provisions, a lot of bailout money would go into the wrong hands. That's turned out to be absolutely correct.</p> <p>But to your larger question about how to convince the wealthy that they need to care for the country as a whole and not just themselves — where to begin? I recently had a bit of a falling out with one of my own sources, a very wealthy person who claims to care about the fate of the nation and all its citizens, but also seems to spend very precise numbers of days per year living in places outside the US with far lower tax rates. This person once advised&#xa0;me, without any sense of irony, to look into whether the advance for my next book — on the problems of neoliberalism — could be kept offshore. Note to any IRS staffers reading this — don't worry, you are getting your full share of the&#xa0;earned income.</p> <p>The people I know like this (and I know plenty) would argue that they are doing more for society with their philanthropy than they would be by putting more money into the coffers of politicians who'll waste it. But that is essentially an argument for noblesse oblige, and if you want that, watch <em>Downton Abbey</em>. Others simply view tax “optimisation”, which is the polite term for employing hoards of lawyers, accountants and estate planners to keep money from the government, as what smart people do. Maybe, but only in the short term. As Mancur Olson argued in <em>The Rise and Decline of Nations</em>, civilisations fall when the moneyed interests capture the system in just this way.</p> <p>To be fair, I&#xa0;know plenty of millionaires (like the <a href=\"https://patrioticmillionaires.org/\">Patriotic&#xa0;ones</a>) and even some billionaires who feel quite differently. But I must say that they tend to be older, and from a different era, one in which the global economy had not moved so very far above the concerns of the nation state. Some of these people are actually trying to change the system, mostly by investing in businesses that nearshore, or by lobbying for shifts in the tax code that would incentivise productive capital investment into the real economy, rather than debt driven financial speculation.</p> <p>This goes to what I feel are the two key points here: first, Ed, I think you are asking the wrong question. It's not about trying to convince rich people that it's in their interests to be part of the system. Paying taxes is the privilege of being a US citizen and enjoying the social and political protections that it affords. If you don't like it, try being a billionaire in China, where what you pay, and where you pay it from — like jail, for example — is completely at the discretion of the Communist party leadership. I would imagine it's a bit like crypto trading — high risk, high reward. It should be up to an electorate to decide who pays taxes and for what.</p> <p>That brings me to my second point — we need to make any number of shifts to ensure that taxes are collected in the US for the right things. We should equalise the rate for earned income and investment income (something <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2104309,00.html\">people like Warren Buffett</a> have been advocating for years). We need to allow companies to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59321a73-5f88-4e94-9aa2-62e4927783b1\">write off investments into human capital</a>, not just machines. We should close a bunch of stupid tax loopholes that incentivise debt and discourage productive capex (read my first book, <em>Makers and Takers</em> on this). And we probably need political reform too — from limits on lobbying money, to changing the primary system and maybe even the electoral college process to ensure that we can get shit done in this country again.</p> <p>I could go on, but you get the idea. Ed, I really appreciate you raising this topic, which is the most important one facing the country today. As I wrote a while back, I think the competition between the US and China (which is certainly in the interest of rich Americans) will be decided based on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0910e0b8-98e1-4d21-b7b8-61c0f7003ddd\">which country can best control its elites.</a></p> <h1>Your feedback </h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to: </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c16f05b8-31f2-434d-935f-da5fd151a758\"><strong>‘Please keep your eye on India's Modi'</strong></a><strong>:</strong> <br>“Ed, it was good to see you calling out Narendra Modi and what is happening in India. The rise of autocracy under Modi must be in the running for the most significant case of democratic backsliding in the world — next&#xa0;to the US. The fixation with China has clearly&#xa0;given Modi a pass in many forums, in DC, London and Paris. As you know, many scholars debate the usefulness of fascism as a concept to explain contemporary strongmen, and the 1930s more generally. But Modi's politics&#xa0;clearly has many fascist characteristics: the curious admixture of mythical past glories with modernist techno-dreamscapes.” <em>— Sanjay Ruparelia, Toronto, Canada</em></p><p>Source: Edward Luce 2022 'Oh what a lovely pandemic — for the rich' FT.com 4 February.
