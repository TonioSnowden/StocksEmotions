  "text": "<p>Marc Lasry, the billionaire investor, has stepped down as chair of Ozy Media after only three weeks in the role, deepening the crisis at the digital media company.</p> <p>The online media business has come under fire after a report in The New York Times questioned its audience figures and revealed that one of its founders had impersonated a YouTube executive on a conference call with Goldman Sachs during a fundraising process. Ozy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ada60018-6d8e-4cde-80da-677ad16de9a2\">appointed </a>law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison to review its business practices this week. </p> <p>Lasry, who co-founded the hedge fund Avenue Capital and is the co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, invested in Ozy and joined the board following a $35m funding round in 2019, the company <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/news-and-politics/join-us-for-the-next-chapter-of-ozy/228351/\">said</a> at the time. </p> <p>He was appointed Ozy's chair earlier this month, having said that he hoped to grow its investor base and lead a new phase of growth for the eight-year-old company. </p> <p>But in a statement on Thursday, Lasry said: “I believe that going forward Ozy requires experience in areas like crisis management and investigations, where I do not have particular expertise. For that reason, I have stepped down from the company's board. I remain an investor in the company and wish it the best going forward.” </p> <p>Lasry's exit follows the resignation of former BBC journalist Katty Kay, one of its star hires, who said the allegations made by The New York Times were “serious and deeply troubling”. </p> <p>Ozy's other investors include the German publisher Axel Springer, SuRo Capital and Emerson Collective, the organisation led by Laurene Powell Jobs. The company has raised more than $80m since its founding, according to PitchBook data.</p> <p>On Tuesday the venture firm SV Angel surrendered its shares in the company&#xa0;after having invested in a seed round in 2012, said one person briefed on the decision. SV Angel and its&#xa0;founder Ron Conway declined to comment.</p> <p>The New York Times reported this week that Samir Rao, co-founder of the company and its chief operating officer, had impersonated a YouTube executive on a conference call with Goldman Sachs, which was a potential investor. </p> <p>Ozy has confirmed the incident occurred, saying it was the result of a mental health episode. The board asked Rao to take a leave of absence pending the result of the law firm's investigation. </p> <p>Carlos Watson, chief executive, co-founder and the public face of Ozy, earlier this week released a statement which included a quote from Lasry confirming that the board had been made aware of the Goldman Sachs call and supported the way it was handled. “The incident was an unfortunate one-time event,” Lasry said in the memo. </p> <p>Lasry is best known as co-owner of the Bucks basketball franchise, which he bought with the private equity investor Wes Edens in 2014. This year the Bucks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac485676-d7d1-43a2-a93f-217df4fa30b8\">won</a> their first NBA championship in half a century, led by two-time league most valuable player Giannis Antetokounmpo. </p><p>Source: Nic Fildes in London, Anna Nicolaou and Sara Germano in New York and Miles Kruppa in San Francisco 2021 'Investor Marc Lasry quits Ozy Media board' FT.com 30 September.
