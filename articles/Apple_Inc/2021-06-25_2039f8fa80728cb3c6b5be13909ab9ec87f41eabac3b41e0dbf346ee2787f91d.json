  "title": "World News:  Dissident Paper Bids  Farewell to Hong Kong  ----  By Elaine Yu",
  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- After 22 years in Apple Daily's newsroom, Norman Choy said he felt like he was the obituaries editor during his final shift on Wednesday as he handled article after article about the demise of his own newspaper, the latest casualty of China's campaign to crush dissent in the Chinese territory. </p><p>   \"Hong Kong lost Apple Daily because Hong Kong has lost its voice,\" Mr. Choy said, attributing the newspaper's popularity to its connection with readers, channeling their hopes for democracy and human rights and standing against Beijing's creeping control of the city. \"The government had to shut us down because it doesn't want to hear these voices anymore.\" </p><p>   In its final hours, the newsroom became the story following Apple Daily's announcement that Thursday's print paper would be its last, after the government choked off its funding and national security police arrested some of its executives. </p><p>    Throngs of cameras from other media outlets documented Apple Daily journalists who skipped meals and breaks to meet their last deadlines. Reporters described contrasting scenes in the paper's final days. Some shredded documents, packed up their desks and cried as they took selfies to remember the place. Others silently typed away at work. </p><p>   After midnight, on Thursday, Apple Daily's presence all but vanished from the Internet: Its website thanked readers and showed instructions on how to cancel their subscriptions. It closed its Twitter and Facebook accounts. </p><p>   As the presses rolled on the final edition, supporters gathered in the rain outside the building cheering on the journalists, who shouted thank you and shone phone flashlights back at the crowd before police came and tried to clear the well-wishers away. </p><p>   \"Hong Kongers Bid a Painful Farewell in the Rain,\" the final edition's front page read, with a photograph from the newsroom's vantage point. The issue had the day's news, including the start of a high-profile national security trial and Covid-19 developments. </p><p>   It also reflected on its past coverage, its insubordinate character and its shared fate with the city. \"The apple was buried in the mud, but its seeds grew into a tree with bigger, even more beautiful apples,\" the paper said in a goodbye letter to readers titled \"Until We Meet Again.\" </p><p>   Apple Daily and its millionaire founder, Jimmy Lai, have long riled the political elite. A brash tabloid-style newspaper, it was founded in the last days of British colonial rule. The inaugural editorial on June 20, 1995, two years before the U.K. handed the city back to China, read: \"Are we not afraid of changes after 1997? We are afraid. But we refuse to be intimidated by fear.\" </p><p>   Like all newspapers, it navigated difficult financial times as the world went digital and was snubbed by many advertisers who avoided it so as not to anger Beijing. But it remained popular with readers. It became a champion of mass pro-democracy protests that peaked in 2019 and triggered monthslong unrest against an uncompromising government that marked the biggest challenge to China's rule. But since Beijing imposed a national security law, authorities raided its newsroom, arrested and jailed Mr. Lai and seized assets. </p><p>   \"Hong Kong people are smart . . . it'll return in another form,\" said Sophie Chan, an Apple Daily reader. \"They can't suppress all our voices.\" </p><p></p>",
