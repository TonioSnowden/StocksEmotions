  "title": "Live Nation Plans to Acquire OCESA Entretenimiento in Move Into Latin America; The world's largest live-entertainment company has revived a pandemic-hit deal to pay about $450 million for a majority stake in the Mexican concert promoter",
  "text": "<p>The deal is now expected to close by late 2021 or early 2022, the company says. It is subject to regulatory approval, which was previously granted during prior negotiations but must be confirmed. The new agreement is a sign the companies are sure that business is getting back on track.</p><p>\"We're confident,\" said Live Nation finance chief Joe Berchtold. \"The timing wasn't right when Covid hit to close it,\" he said. \"They're the mini Live Nation of Mexico and the beachhead to Latin America.\"</p><p>Live Nation plans to acquire Spanish-speaking multimedia giant Grupo Televisa's 40% stake in OCESA, plus another 11% of the company from another Latin American live-entertainment company, CIE, which will hold the remaining 49%, the company says. While the terms of the new agreement are mostly the same, Live Nation is expected to hold back 7% of the closing price to cover any potential operating losses for several quarters. The deal price is 8.84 billion Mexican pesos, equivalent to $444 million at Friday's close. The agreement is expected to be announced Monday.</p><p>Touring—the primary source of revenue for most musicians—has become an increasingly global business. With the rise of music streaming on services such as Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which give users the ability to discover and listen to vast catalogs of music, acts are developing more fans across the world. Markets in Latin America, in particular, have helped drive the streaming boom. The purchase will help Live Nation bring its artists' shows to their expanding audiences.</p><p>Mr. Berchtold said Latin America is Live Nation's largest untapped market, as its presence there has lagged behind Europe and Asia. While OCESA has long served as the company's touring, festival and ticketing partner in Mexico, Live Nation now has a direct economic incentive to build its tours in a way to include the market, he said.</p><p>He said he expects domestic touring in Mexico to pick up this year, before seeing festivals in the region in the first half of 2022 and more international tours later in the year.</p><p>OCESA promotes more than 3,100 events for nearly six million fans in a typical year in Mexico and Colombia and has businesses including ticketing, sponsorship, food and beverage, merchandise, and venue operation. It owns or operates 13 venues across Mexico, including Foro Sol and Auditorio Nacional, the top stadium and theater, respectively, in the world by tickets sold in 2019, according to industry trade publication Pollstar.</p><p>In Latin America, OCESA promotes several of the largest touring acts including Coldplay, Paul McCartney, and U2, and some of the largest festivals. As part of the planned deal, Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster, said it would acquire Ticketmaster Mexico, which sells about 20 million tickets annually.</p><p>Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com</p><p>Live Nation Plans to Acquire OCESA Entretenimiento in Move Into Latin America</p>",
