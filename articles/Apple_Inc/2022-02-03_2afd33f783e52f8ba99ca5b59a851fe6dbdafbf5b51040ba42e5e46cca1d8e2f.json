  "text": "<p>Meta said it expected revenue growth to slow because users were spending less time on its more lucrative services. It cited inflation as a weight on advertiser spending and estimated that ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple Inc. last year would cost Meta some $10 billion this year.</p><p>If the declines hold through the close, the drop in market value would exceed the record that Apple set in September 2020. The iPhone-maker lost about $182 billion on Sept. 3 that year, according to Dow Jones Market Data, during a selloff of technology stocks.</p><p>Meta's 25% decline in its stock price would also spell its steepest one-day decline since it started trading in 2012. In July 2018, shares fell 19%—the current record daily fall—after the social-media company warned about slowing growth.</p><p>Investors have fled some tech titans over the past month in favor of older-economy stocks that stand to perform better in a period of rising interest rates. The loss of Meta's market cap would put its size near that of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Facebook, as it was then known, surpassed Berkshire in market value for the first time in 2016.</p><p>Meta's sell-off rippled to other growth and technology stocks. Amazon.com Inc., which reports results after the closing bell, lost 6.6%. Snap Inc. tumbled 20%, Pinterest Inc. fell 8% and Twitter Inc. slid 5.3%.</p><p>Spotify Technology SA tumbled 15%, also on pace for its largest one-day decline on record. The music-streaming and podcast company's results, released Wednesday, showed that it added users and experienced a surge in advertising revenue, but it declined to issue annual guidance.</p><p>Meta's plunge weighed on broader markets. The stock had a 2% weighting on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index as of Wednesday, according to data from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Apple, by comparison, has a 7% weight. Microsoft Corp. has a 6% weight.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.7% in recent trading, on pace to snap a four-day winning streak. In contrast, the equally weighted S&amp;P 500 index—which gives the same weight to both the smallest and largest companies in the index—ticked down 0.6%</p><p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 2.7%.</p><p>\"Confidence is being knocked because Meta is such a big player on the indices,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at U.K. asset manager and stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Ultimately Meta is having to invest so heavily into [research and development] and preparing for the metaverse. That's why it's getting a thumbs-down from investors.\"</p><p>Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in October that the company's focus would pivot to VR headsets, AR glasses and virtual worlds, known as the metaverse, in which users can live and work.</p><p>Meta shares are down 28% year to date.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Facebook Parent Meta's Stock Plunges, Loses More Than $200 Billion in Value</p>",
