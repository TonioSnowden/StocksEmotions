  "title": "Apple CEO Cook's Pay Jumps As Remote Work Lifted Profit",
  "text": "<p>His bonus had taken a 36% hit in 2019 when his pay package fell as revenue and profit declined tied to weaker iPhone sales.</p><p>In the past fiscal year, despite a global pandemic that disrupted economies around the world, Apple's profit rose 3.9% with laptops and iPads sales benefiting from workers and students stuck at home as part of efforts to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>Apple's share price rose more than 80% in 2020, placing its market value at more than $2 trillion.</p><p>In addition to his compensation, Mr. Cook had a total of $281.9 million in restricted stock that vested during the year.</p><p>Those shares were a core part of Mr. Cook's long-term incentive package that was awarded in 2011 when he became CEO.</p><p>The decadelong plan's final tranche vests later this year.</p><p>In September, Apple's board awarded a new long-term equity plan to Mr. Cook with shares that vest from 2023 through 2025, giving him incentive to stay on as CEO through that period. Mr. Cook, 60 years old, joined Apple in 1998.</p><p>According to Apple's proxy filing, Mr. Cook's 2020 pay, excluding vested shares, totaled $14.8 million, including the cash bonus and a $3 million salary that didn't change from the prior year.</p><p>The package included $470,246 in security costs and $432,564 for air travel.</p><p>The company requires Mr. Cook to use private planes for all business and personal travel.</p><p>In the prior year, fiscal 2019, Mr. Cook's executive compensation, excluding vested shares, totaled nearly $11.6 million. His pay included a $7.7 million cash bonus, some $450,000 in security costs and $315,000 in air- travel expenses.</p><p>For the quarter ended in September, sales of computers, iPads and smartwatches helped buoy the company in the three-month period, with total revenue rising 1%.</p><p>Wall Street analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, expected revenue to fall for the period. Revenue excluding iPhone sales rose 25% compared with a year ago, with Mac computers reaching a record of $9 billion.</p><p>That quarter's profit fell to $12.7 billion, or 73 cents a share, from $13.7 billion, or 76 cents a year earlier, the company said. The results beat analyst expectations for profit of 71 cents a share.</p><p>The results helped Apple conclude its fiscal year with an increase in revenue and profit after both figures fell in the previous 12-month period.</p>",
