  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: Credit Suisse</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6b49eb1-5f3c-49c2-be6d-09ca1acda464\">has fired</a> two managers who oversaw the $10bn suite of <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>-linked funds that blew up in March, with more departures expected.</p> <h2>DD chats with one of the top players in UK M&amp;A</h2> <p>To those who know how to play the M&amp;A game in the UK, the low-key <strong>Takeover Panel</strong> is the most important institution around. </p> <p>Aficionados of <em>The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers</em> — the holy book for dealmakers — know there are only a handful of individuals who wield significant influence over how the rules are written. </p> <p>One of those few is bowing out after more than three decades on the panel. </p> <p><strong>Tony Pullinger</strong>, who began his career as a corporate broker at <strong>Laing &amp; Cruickshank</strong>, is retiring at the end of this month. Now deputy director-general, he first joined the panel in 1982 for two years as a secondee before being asked to permanently rejoin at the end of 1990. &#xa0;</p> <p>Pullinger has since had a front-row seat to every UK public takeover battle, big or small, giving him a near-encyclopedic knowledge of dealmaking in the City of London.</p> <p>For those less familiar with the panel, it manages to enforce <a href=\"https://www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk/the-code/download-code\">its code</a> — things like the 28-day offer timetable or the 30 per cent mandatory offer threshold — with few powers beyond the much-dreaded statement of public censure or the reputation-killing “<a href=\"https://www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk/the-code/compliance/cold-shouldering\">cold shoulder</a>” (*gasp!*).&#xa0;</p> <p>Quaint as the institution may be, adherence to the code is near-perfect, and its rules are arguably the most effective road maps anywhere (including the US) for making sure shareholders are treated fairly. </p> <p>DD and Lex's Jonathan Guthrie spoke to Pullinger about his career earlier this month. Here are some highlights (edited for length and clarity):</p> <p><strong>DD: What do you feel is different about the panel from when you first started?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> The world has changed significantly, but the panel has maintained its key strengths and benefits. There's been a huge amount of change over the last 30 years in terms of who owns corporate Britain . . . but the panel's key features have remained remarkably unchanged. The crucial thing is that we are not an outcome-focused regulator. We are a neutral regulator. We have no interest in discouraging or encouraging bids for UK companies. </p> <p><strong>DD:</strong> <strong>Will the new UK national security laws being brought in by the government in January affect the panel?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> I don't think it will affect the panel at all. The powers are wide-ranging. The world does not know how the government will use those powers, but they extend far more widely than the old ability to intervene. We have three objectives: fair treatment for shareholders, providing an orderly timetable that is fair for all parties, and maintaining market transparency during the course of bids. They haven't changed in 30 years and there is no prospect of that changing anytime soon. </p> <p><strong>DD: Are the new national security rules a bad thing for the City?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Well, it will be bad for City fees if there are less deals. But whether it is good or bad for the country, that is something I don't have a view on. We have a remarkably open regime compared to other countries. </p> <p><strong>DD: Are there certain tools you wish you had to make the administration of the rules easier?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> The honest answer is no. Why do you need a rocket launcher if a baseball bat already works? We have a high level of compliance with our rules. The reason that criticism is a sanction means more here than in other jurisdictions is because the panel has won over the respect of the City, investors and practitioners for over half a century. </p> <p><strong>DD: What's the memorable takeover situation of your career?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> A case that is etched in my memory is the <strong>NatWest </strong>saga over the winter of 1999 and into 2000. It was a very tense time. You had the . . . regulator coming in, you had the millennium bug coming and you had this competitive set of proposals for NatWest from <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> and <strong>Bank of Scotland</strong>. It all started with an agreed deal for NatWest to buy <strong>Friends Provident</strong> in the autumn, which was then turned over by a bid from BoS and then RBS. </p> <p><strong>DD: Do you have any outgoing advice to the panel?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> I've said this for a very long time. It is important for the panel to remember to not slip into legalism. If you've got to a place where people say “well it isn't written down in black-and-white and therefore we can't address it” —&#xa0; that is dramatically important. The M&amp;A world is staffed by intelligent, innovative people and so it is important that the panel is in a position to not be outwitted. </p> <h2>The latest scandal at NSO Group could be the final straw for the US</h2> <p>For Israel's embattled <strong>NSO Group</strong>, maker of the now-infamous Pegasus spyware, the news remains <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5feb53-e7ff-47b3-ad42-93a8f2bc6aac\">relentlessly grim</a>. </p> <p>This week, a secret deal has landed the cyberweapon manufacturer in the crosshairs of the US, the FT's Mehul Srivastava <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/319e691a-9db1-46e6-b7ea-c899715756b4\">reports</a> from Jerusalem.</p> <p>That deal, which involves the son of Uganda's autocratic president <strong>Yoweri Museveni </strong>and the possibility that the spyware was then turned against US diplomats and embassy employees in Kampala, may be the one that ultimately proves fatal to the spyware manufacturer, according to insiders.</p> <p>Neither US nor Israeli officials would confirm that this hack, involving 11 US personnel using Ugandan numbers on their iPhones, led to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e381b556-c859-4a3b-8f7c-5fe80d3272d2\">November blacklisting</a> of NSO by the US <strong>Department of Commerce</strong>. But <strong>Apple</strong>'s lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ace7c109-7404-4986-ae11-4074a497c934\">most certainly did</a>, and has put the Israeli company up against one of the most powerful tech groups in the world. </p> <p>For NSO, which says it only sells to government agencies involved in fighting terrorism and serious crime, the blacklisting — connected to Uganda or not — is the more immediate danger.</p> <p>A quick recap: the Herzliya-based company, once valued at $1bn in a private-equity led buyout, has been caught up in revelations that its software turns any phone into a recording device and mirrors its contents. The technology has been abused regularly by its clients to monitor people completely unrelated to crime or terrorism, according to watchdog groups including <strong>Citizen Lab</strong> and <strong>Amnesty International</strong>.</p> <p>Led by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c31af1b-7b25-4434-af09-bd9e1b49009b\">jocular foul-mouthed executive</a> <strong>Shalev Hulio</strong>, who flew around the world selling the spyware to Israel's allies, NSO emerged as the frontrunner in Israel's burgeoning “lawful interception” industry. (Customers are reported to be Saudi Arabia, Morocco, the UAE and Bahrain.)</p> <p>Now, with its debt trading at 70 cents on the dollar, NSO is considering putting parts of the group up for sale. But shedding assets doesn't get rid of looming legal issues as Apple's suit plays out in court, not to mention earlier legal action brought by <strong>Facebook </strong>accusing NSO of targeting <strong>WhatsApp</strong> users.</p> <p>NSO has also hired New York investment bank <strong>Moelis &amp; Co</strong> and <strong>PJT Partners </strong>to try and turn Pegasus into a “defensive product” to attract more US investors, a plan that could be potentially derailed by Washington lawmakers currently looking to sanction NSO under the Magnitsky Act.</p> <p>If they're successful, NSO would be cut off from the US banking system and its employees would be barred from travelling to the US.</p> <p>With few options left, it's unclear where the company will turn. Watch this space.</p> <h2>The private equity party at Calpers is just getting started</h2> <p>Listening in on most pension fund meetings can be snooze-worthy enough to double as a bedtime story. But the goings-on at Calpers, America's largest public retirement fund, have caught DD's attention.</p> <p>That's because, in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f71d21aa-82f5-47f9-ad3b-c1b41779e50e\">interview</a> with the FT, the pension's chief<strong> Marcie Frost </strong>doubled down on its aversion to hedge funds — declaring that their fees remain “problematic”. Calpers dumped its $4bn in hedge fund holdings in 2014.</p> <p>“We all have to look at fees,” she said. “Everything we are paying to an outside manager is money that is not available to pay benefits.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Frost's statement is the kind that could get private equity groups fretting. After all, they charge a similar fee to hedge funds, earning about 2 per cent of assets under management, and 20 per cent of the profits they generate. </p> <p>But they needn't worry. Calpers is actually increasing investment in private equity.</p> <p>The fund is in the middle of overhauling its investment portfolio, moving money out of equities, ratcheting up private equity by 5 percentage points to 13 per cent of its total assets over a period of four years, and adding a 5 per cent allocation to private debt. </p> <p>With $500bn to play with, that's a whole lot of fees in private equity's pocket. Frost says that Calpers has been building up its direct investment teams to save on the steep cost of working with private investment managers, but also said she would be willing to pass the 13 per cent threshold “if there were good quality deals”.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Disney </strong>has named<strong> Horacio Gutierrez</strong>, the famed corporate litigator who hails from <strong>Spotify</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong>, as its new general counsel. He succeeds <strong>Alan Braverman</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69e1cc1e-9c64-4000-b47f-a7e448107a5b\">is retiring</a> after nearly two decades in the position.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Greenwashers beware</strong> A quant investor has a novel system for fact-checking corporations eager to flaunt their sustainability efforts, and he can make money trading on his findings.
