  "text": "<p>Wolfgang Tillmans: To Look Without Fear</p><p>Museum of Modern Art Through Jan. 1, 2023</p><p>\"Wolfgang Tillmans: To Look Without Fear,\" his retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, is designed to reflect this egalitarian attitude. Organized by Roxana Marcoci, senior curator of photography, who persevered heroically despite Covid-19 postponements and also edited the huge catalog, the overwhelming show occupies the entire sixth floor.</p><p>The fastidious installation, though, has unmistakably been crafted by Mr. Tillmans. More than 400 prints are spread across 11 rooms and the atrium. Most are unframed, hung in unpredictable patterns, and taped or clipped to the walls. Others are in vitrines or mounted on aluminum. Three videos play in loops in two adjacent spaces.</p><p>The display forces interactivity. As viewers move through the galleries, they must constantly adjust their distance from the images—sizes vary from 10 feet across to barely larger than an iPhone—and be alert. The first room has a pair of portraits—one a close-up, one full figure—fixed to the thin edge of a partition.</p><p>It's hard to resist Mr. Tillmans's joyous intoxication with photography or his idealism. He loves what a camera can do, the details and textures it can bring out, the moods it can instantly conjure up, its communicative powers. In the world he portrays, there's room for everyone, and anyone of any ethnicity and gender orientation is free to couple.</p><p>He is no less enamored with the expressive potential of printers and laser photocopiers. Like Robert Rauschenberg and Sigmar Polke, he has developed a palette that takes the medium beyond traditional black-and-white and color and into off-register shades and intensities. Camera-free images, inkjet and chromogenic prints, tear sheets and photocopies are handled with equal regard.</p><p>Mr. Tillmans belongs to the third generation of photographer-diarists, a mode associated in the 1960s and '70s with Larry Clark and William Eggleston and in the 1980s with Nan Goldin.</p><p>The spotlight first fell on Mr. Tillmans in the '90s for visceral snapshots of London's gay club scene published in i-D, the punk-inspired British fashion and music magazine. Winning the Turner Prize in 2000—the first photographer to be so honored—catapulted him into the upper tiers of the art world, where he has been ever since.</p><p>He and his team have presented his work in more than a dozen countries, expeditions funded in part by the high prices he now commands. A feathery red abstraction, \"Zero Gravity V\" (2001), sold at Christie's this March for $201,600.</p><p>He remains attracted to the energy of youth culture and to healthy, lean bodies. There are only a few elderly people in the retrospective and almost no sick or fat ones. Income disparity is not prominent in his world. Suffering and death are only alluded to. I counted only three images among the 417 of anyone at a job: two framed photocopies of construction workers in Edinburgh (1987); and a color print (2015) of four men scraping the floor for an installation of Mr. Tillmans's art.</p><p>Among the more than 30 books Mr. Tillmans has published since 1995, my favorite is \"Concorde\" (1997). The 56 color prints, arrayed here in a grid along one wall in Room 2, document the now-defunct supersonic airliner as it took off and landed at Heathrow Airport in the U.K. over several weeks in 1997.</p><p>What's touching about the series is not the technique—the photos simply record a dark, blurry, wedge-winged object as it passes overhead against the sky—but the emotional pull the sight of the plane has on Mr. Tillmans. His politics tell him to condemn this wasteful symbol of luxury, built for a social class he is supposed to disdain. And yet this sleek, booming promise of the modernist future excites a boyhood wonder about technology that he had never lost.</p><p>The last room has two of the most arresting images in the show. The first (2021) is a metal column covered in sludgy gray cement at a building site, the kind of ugliness only a photographer would find beautiful; the second (2020) is a still-life of an iPhone propped against a bottle of water in a hospital room. The screen on the phone has an enigmatic image of another place entirely, thus effectively distorting the scene—Cubism for the Instagram age and an odd self-portrait.</p><p>Mr. Tillmans has expanded the possibilities of documentary photography with a flair, and without a big budget, in ways that others are already imitating. Anyone curious to see where he has led us needs to visit \"To Look Without Fear,\" and probably more than once.</p><p>Mr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.</p><p>'Wolfgang Tillmans: To Look Without Fear' Review: A Photographer's Zest for Life</p>",
