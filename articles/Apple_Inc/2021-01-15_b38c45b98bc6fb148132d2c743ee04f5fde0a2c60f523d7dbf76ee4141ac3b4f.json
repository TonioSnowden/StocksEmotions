It seems a lot of people on my street are going for deep, gloomy colours these days. What do you think the colours of 2021 should be?</strong></p> <p>Last February, I declared purple and peach the hot wall colours for 2020. In fact, I ended up using peach quite liberally at the hotel I have been decorating in Paris. But I also stated that choosing a paint colour is a deeply personal decision, and I stand by this. </p> <p>When it comes to your own home, there really are no right or wrong answers. I advocate following your instincts and not worrying about what is perceived as popular.</p> <p>Pantone's colours of 2021 were announced recently: a very cheerful bright yellow called Illuminating, and Ultimate Grey. Pantone maintains that “these colours convey a message of strength and hopefulness that is both enduring and uplifting”. The yellow I can get behind: it's a good one, clear and joyful like early Cornish daffodils. The grey, on the other hand . . . I'm not sure that I would call this an uplifting colour. It says prison cell to me.</p> <p>Now that we are in the middle of another lockdown, many of us are pondering what miracles we can achieve at home with a paintbrush and a toolbox. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45c71be-77f7-463c-ad48-16713e840895\">High-end paint sales at Mylands and Farrow &amp; Ball surged</a> after the first lockdown in March. </p> <p>I am on the hunt for a new studio space here in the Cotswolds, and this may present an interesting opportunity. Naturally, it will depend on what I can find — the architecture, the light and so on — but what colours am I craving?</p> <p>I still love those we chose for our cottage in the summer of 2018, but they are generally either fairly dark and rich (grassy olive, deep mustard) or dusty and pale (lilac, plaster pink, sky blue). They are all rather bold colours, I would say, but not particularly intense. </p> <p>Our guest bathroom, however, remains a favourite room because of its searing arsenic walls, ceiling and woodwork. I would like to continue this idea with a punchy studio: walls in a shocking pink or marigold.</p> <p>As I will only be working in this new space in the daytime, I won't have to worry about how a lemon or fuchsia room will function in the evening. But this is something you should consider. </p> <p>We painted our sitting room in London shocking pink a few years ago and had to repaint it a few days later because in the evenings, with table lamps on, we were living inside a highlighter pen. Not even the combined efforts of sunglasses and paracetamol could provide relief.</p> <p>Think about using bright hues in a clever way: smaller spaces such as loos can certainly take them. Patrick Baty's Papers and Paints ranges include many fabulously vivid shades. I like the look of Lemon and Plum from the company's marvellous 1960s selection.</p> <p>The colour dial doesn't always want to be turned up to 11. Milkier, subtler shades are intriguing too. I am never into chilly colours — cool blues and such — and besides, this year we need a bit of extra cocooning, and warmer shades can provide this. </p> <p>I am rather into the idea of a new workspace with walls painted to look like overly buttery hollandaise. Little Greene's Carys, described as a “classic Regency colour”, might do the trick. </p> <p>I like the idea of pale, minty avocado, too — see Little Greene's Cupboard Green. Or how about something just a little punchier? I am often drawn to limy chartreuses, such as Edward Bulmer's Olympian Green (wonderful name), which would be a glorious backdrop for brown furniture and contrast beautifully with white woodwork.</p> <p>Throughout my own search, I keep returning to the Regency era. Sir John Soane's zesty yellow drawing room has provided much inspiration. Early 19th-century colours — lilacs and pale yellows — make up one of my favourite palettes, and come with some rather fascinating backstories, too. Think of Puce, the colour of 1805: the name refers to the colour of coagulated blood found inside fleas (<em>puces</em>).</p> <p>Green is a favourite colour, but my last studio had olive walls and our country sitting room recalls ferns and vines. I can't do another green space. Or can I? I've become a bit obsessed with Pomona Green — a completely new one on me. </p> <p>Regency interiors were all about classical flamboyance. Pomona was the Roman goddess of the orchards and the apple, naturally, was her favourite fruit. Pomona is apple green with a more romantic name.</p> <p>So let's embrace the Regency this year: I'll agree with Pantone that daffodil yellow is an excellent, cheerful choice for 2021, but I'll replace Prison Grey with my new zingy find: Pomona Green. Yes, that's two punchy choices, but gosh knows, we need them.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
