  "text": "<p>\n  [The trusted advisers of top business leaders] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Marissa Mayer, the former chief executive of Yahoo Inc., defied the pandemic in November to launch the first app from Sunshine Products Inc., a tech startup she co-founded in 2018 after leaving Yahoo. Its Sunshine Contacts app automatically organizes and improves iPhone address books. </p><p>\n  Ms. Mayer, 45, envisions a bright future for Sunshine, based in Palo Alto, Calif., because its planned products will simplify mundane tasks. Her optimism partly reflects supportive and candid feedback from mentors -- though \"I didn't necessarily always like what they had to say.\"\" </p><p>\n  Ms. Mayer was on the tech-exec fast track early. She fielded 14 job offers in spring 1999 while completing her Stanford University master's degree in computer science. She accepted one from Google, figuring the leaders of the fledgling search engine could teach her a lot even if they failed. Ms. Mayer was its 20th employee. She advanced to an executive role by 2003. </p><p>\n  Later, during Ms. Mayer's five-year command at Yahoo, its market capitalization increased $33 billion. Yet she couldn't revitalize a company that had struggled with high executive turnover and ad-revenue declines. Yahoo sold its core business to Verizon Communications Inc. in 2017. </p><p>\n  Here are four of Ms. Mayer's most trusted advisers. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Maureen Taylor </p><p>\n  CEO and co-founder of SNP Communications </p><p>\n  Ms. Taylor has counseled Ms. Mayer about professional moves since 2004. The most critical? Whether to join Yahoo while expecting her first child. Ms. Taylor was among the few people aware of Ms. Mayer's pregnancy when Yahoo offered the top spot in 2012. \"I didn't know if I could be a first-time CEO and a first-time mom at the same time,\" Ms. Mayer notes. Ms. Taylor insisted that she could. \"Love and family don't take away from being a leader,\" Ms. Taylor remembers reassuring her. \"And being a good leader doesn't take away from love and family.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Eric Schmidt </p><p>\n  Former chairman &amp; CEO of Google Inc. and former chairman of Alphabet Inc. </p><p>\n  During Ms. Mayer's first month at Yahoo, Mr. Schmidt offered her sage advice about being an effective leader, explaining that a chief executive must only make a few crucial decisions. \"But there are times you weigh in and push very hard for a specific thing,\"\" he recalls telling her. \"This is what CEOs must get right.\" Ms. Mayer says she initially resisted his strategy but gradually began asking herself if she could delegate crucial decisions to her associates. She now realizes that only a few of her Yahoo decisions \"really mattered in terms of the course of the company.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Maynard Webb </p><p>\n  A founder of Webb Investment Network and former Yahoo Inc. chairman </p><p>\n  Mr. Webb, a former eBay Inc. executive who was named Yahoo chairman in 2013, says the best advice he offered Ms. Mayer was that she should thoroughly explore important issues with her fellow directors \"even when you know what needs to be done.\" As she weighed her next move after her Yahoo stint, Mr. Webb suggested she \"chart her own course and do so totally on her own terms.\" Ms. Mayer says that meant finding a strong co-founder -- Enrique Munoz Torres, a Yahoo exec she knew from Google -- and involving employees in crafting their venture's direction. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Sarah Leary </p><p>\n  A venture partner at Unusual Ventures and a co-founder of Nextdoor Inc. </p><p>\n  The two executives have been good friends since they crashed a mutual acquaintance's honeymoon in Venice 15 years ago. Ms. Leary subsequently helped found Nextdoor, a neighborhood social network. In April 2020, she became a venture partner at Unusual Ventures, an early-stage venture-capital firm. Ms. Mayer was the first person whom she backed as an Unusual Ventures investor. She urged Ms. Mayer to quickly \"get into the market with something even if it's rough.\" Ms. Mayer did so -- by introducing Sunshine Contacts sooner and postponing certain features. </p><p></p>",
