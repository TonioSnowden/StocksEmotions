  "title": "What to Watch: The 19 Best New Movies and TV Shows From November; Daniel Craig reprises Benoit Blanc, crypto is explained, Selena Gomez unburdens herself, documentaries illuminate King Tut, woodpeckers, Mars rovers, and much, much more",
  "text": "<p>After the remake of \"Murder on the Orient Express\" revived the murder mystery in 2017, two years later \"Knives Out\" revived the subgenre of the comic whodunit best exemplified by such '70s Peter Falk movies as \"The Cheap Detective\" and \"Murder by Death.\" When it comes to comedy, Daniel Craig is no Peter Falk, and in the second \"Knives Out\" movie, the biggest mystery remains, \"Why is Daniel Craig's Southern accent so terrible?\" I half-expected the explanation to be that Mr. Craig's detective Benoit Blanc is actually a suave English spy in disguise. Still, the nattily attired Blanc is not only a detective dandy, he's a dandy detective, and \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\" is breezy holiday entertainment.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Crypto Decoded' (PBS)</p><p>Cryptocurrency, according to comedian John Oliver, involves \"everything you don't understand about money combined with everything you don't understand about computers.\" Amen. For those who aren't quite sure they fully understand it—and those who, like this critic, definitely do not—\"Crypto Decoded\" should be the last word in explaining the alternative money.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Selena Gomez: My Mind &amp; Me' (Apple TV+)</p><p>The ironies abound in \" Selena Gomez : My Mind &amp; Me,\" a documentary about the child star turned pop idol and writer-performer of the self-care anthem. \"Who says you're not perfect?\" she sings defiantly. \"Who says you're not worth it?\" Were she asking herself, the answer would be \"Selena Gomez.\" She is startlingly candid about her physical and mental health and the rigors of celebrity itself. But for all the media scrutiny and TMZ-style reportage that plague her, had Ms. Gomez lived in another era—say, that of Marilyn Monroe—her crippling self-doubt, insecurities and depression might have been suffered in private, or been covered up, and tragedy might have ensued. There's an upside to exposure.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Tutankhamun: Allies &amp; Enemies' (PBS)</p><p>One hundred years ago the archaeologist Howard Carter chiseled a hole in a doorway of an as-yet-unexplored vault in Luxor's Valley of the Kings and, by candlelight, peered in. What do you see? asked his longtime, long-suffering financial backer, Lord Carnarvon. \"Wonderful things,\" Carter responded, which seems a rather restrained reaction: What he'd found was the tomb of King Tutankhamun, one of a handful of the most significant and bountiful discoveries in the unearthing of the ancient world.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Next at the Kennedy Center: A Joni Mitchell Songbook' (PBS)</p><p>Like a bouquet of gilded lilies, \"A Joni Mitchell Songbook\" offers a tribute to Ms. Mitchell as well as a bit of misdirection. The subject, now 79 years old, does not appear, which is hardly a shock, but neither is the show a songbook in the customary sense. The focus at the Kennedy Center, where the special was filmed in May, is on two specific Mitchell albums, \"Both Sides Now\" and \"Travelogue,\" which featured well-known numbers embellished with full orchestrations arranged by Vince Mendoza. He is on hand to conduct the National Symphony Orchestra and several guests putting their own vocal spin on the songs. It makes for one lush hour of Mitchell.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'The Menu'</p><p>A lot of teasing is aimed at pompous food snobs these days, but not nearly enough. The black comedy \"The Menu\" is a wicked treat aimed at those who roll their eyes whenever foodies refer to a steak as \"the protein,\" stop mid-bite to say things like \"I'm getting bergamot here\" or lasciviously photograph their meals.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'The Fabelmans'</p><p>As recalled in the deeply felt and finely etched memoir-movie \"The Fabelmans,\" Steven Spielberg grew up in a family where one parent was an artist and the other an engineer. A more ideal background can scarcely be imagined for a film director, who must navigate overlapping creative and technical challenges on every project. His parents even provided young Steven with narrative sustenance: an appropriately cinematic family mystery that took him many years to understand and that has given much texture to his work. Absent or distracted fathers are a recurring feature in the early films, but Mr. Spielberg learned as an adult that it was his mother who was primarily responsible for a family rift.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Good Night Oppy'</p><p>An entire generation has grown up understanding that having access to high-quality images from the surface of Mars is routine. The rousing documentary \"Good Night Oppy\" seeks to restore a proper measure of wonder to the spectacularly effective deployment of exploration rovers to the surface of a once-unreachable planet.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Agatha Christie's Hjerson' (Topic)</p><p>\"Agatha Christie's Hjerson\" is one more indication that the venerated Christie was the gift to crime fiction that will never stop giving. The novelist never wrote a Hjerson book, but Ariadne Oliver did and Oliver—novelist, confidante of Hercule Poirot, apple-munching avatar of the author—was a Christie creation herself. It's an audacious thing to conjure up a mystery series about a character created by a character created by a writer who has been gone for 46 years. But in terms of plots, twists and mortality rates, Christie and \"Hjerson\" couldn't be closer, never mind their three or four degrees of separation.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Irreverent' (Peacock)</p><p>Given that he's about to impersonate a pastor in a spiritually needy backwater, Chicago mobster Paulo (Colin Donnell), the felonious fulcrum of \"Irreverent,\" may seem unworthy of our sympathy. But consider his plight: He's fleeing the city after almost being murdered. He's heading to a place where the last clergyman was eaten by a crocodile. Perhaps worst of all, he's seated next to a real minister who has just been dumped by his wife. And won't stop talking about it. On a 22-plus-hour flight to Australia. There are worse things than crocodiles.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Wednesday' (Netflix)</p><p>TV's original goth girl gets her own show called \"Wednesday\" and starring Jenna Ortega as Wednesday. As in Addams. The Addams Family has enjoyed so many manifestations that the natural question isn't how far the new eight-episode series strays from all the other TV shows, movies or what cartoonist Charles Addams created in 1938. It's about whether the show has a satisfying sense of many people's favorite Addams—and some aspects of the show feel perfectly right: If you described the show as \"delightful,\" for instance, this Wednesday would probably retch.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Slumberland' (Netflix)</p><p>Winsor McCay's \"Little Nemo in Slumberland,\" born on the comics pages of the New York Herald in 1905, is considered among the masterpieces of a medium never meant to be taken seriously. Like \"Krazy Kat,\" \"Gasoline Alley\" and \"Prince Valiant,\" McCay's contribution to the Sunday funnies transcended the limits of what was fated to be fish wrapper, and instead approached high art.</p><p>The fantasy-adventure \"Slumberland,\" which does a gender swap with Nemo and uses state-of-the-art technology to emulate a 117-year-old comic strip, is not the proto-surrealist's dream that the original was. They certainly share a trippy take on physics and a psychedelic palette, but the film conforms far more closely to the traditional fairy tale, or maybe a Dickens novel (with a dram of \"Treasure Island\").</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Master of Light' (HBO)</p><p>\"If his talent doesn't grab your attention, his story will,\" says a newscaster heard in the background during \"Master of Light\": George Anthony Morton, young, black and formerly incarcerated, paints in the style of the 17th-century Dutch Masters. As local news goes, it's a producer's dream.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'The Wonder' (Netflix)</p><p>One of the many virtues of \"The Wonder,\" which includes a sublime performance by Florence Pugh, is the case it makes for itself as a film. Not every story can or should be a movie, despite Hollywood's insistence otherwise. Some should remain books. Some should remain silent. And some, such as this, provide a fresh reminder of the power of visual storytelling—and, as happens here, its necessity: It would seem otherwise impossible to unfold such a tale when so much of it is clamped between its characters' teeth.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Tulsa King' (Paramount+)</p><p>There are several fictions perpetrated by the vaguely comic \"Tulsa King.\" One suggests that there are areas of this country so innocent and untouched by evildoers that an aging mob capo could come in and transform the place, virtually overnight, into Vito Corleone's Little Italy circa 1920. Another suggests that said gangster, Dwight Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone), could be mistaken by an extremely attractive local woman (Andrea Savage) for a \"hard 55\" rather than his actual 75 years of age. It's something that the series has to deal with eventually and does quickly, if not mercifully.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'The English' (Prime Video)</p><p>Revisionist westerns have been around since \"Stagecoach,\" but the trajectory of the genre—traveling as it does through the work of Sergio Leone, Quentin Tarantino, Jordan Peele and even John Ford himself—has arced, ever so inevitably, toward madness and horror. Which is director Hugo Blick's intended destination in \"The English.\"</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'The Calling' (Peacock)</p><p>The best fictional detectives have their signature eccentricities. Sherlock Holmes had unimpeachable inductive reasoning and a cocaine habit. Columbo had faux-naivete and a trench coat. Hercule Poirot had \"enormous moustaches.\" Avraham Avraham? His hook—nay, his superpower—is his Jewishness.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Elesin Oba: The King's Horseman' (Netflix)</p><p>If a viewer wants to kick off his algorithms and settle into that elusive \"something different\" on Netflix, a welcome destination would be \"Elesin Oba: The King's Horseman,\" the last movie by the Nigerian novelist, playwright and filmmaker Biyi Bandele, who died in August. His \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandiwe Newton was a successful adaptation of the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie novel back in 2013, but \"Horseman\" is something else, a combination celebration of and elegy for cultural autonomy and something of a cheeky homage to African cinema.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>'Woodpeckers: The Hole Story' (PBS)</p><p>The good news: Despite the constant hammering of its head, the woodpecker suffers no brain damage. The bad news: Its brain is too small to sustain damage.</p><p>But they are noble creatures, these woodpeckers, especially as portrayed in \"Woodpeckers: The Hole Story,\" a \"Nature\" presentation narrated by Paul Giamatti.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>What to Watch: The 19 Best New Movies and TV Shows From November</p>",
