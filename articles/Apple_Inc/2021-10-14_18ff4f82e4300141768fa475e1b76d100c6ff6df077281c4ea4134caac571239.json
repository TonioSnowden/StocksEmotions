  "text": "<p>Nobel Prize-winning physicist Frank Wilczek explores the secrets of the cosmos. Read previous columns here.</p><p>A few weeks ago, walking in the woods around Concord, Mass., I let myself wander at random, communing with nature.</p><p>I took in beautiful scenery near and far—both available in focus, thanks to my progressive-lens eyeglasses. Occasionally I'd pull out my iPhone to take pictures or to zoom in on interesting micro-ecologies or big birds in the distance. I had fun searching for, and finding, a pair of brightly colored woodpeckers, whose activity had announced their presence. I took photos and recorded a stream of consciousness (with a background of birdsong and other sounds of the forest) on Voice Memos. Since the walk was also meant to be exercise, from time to time I consulted my iWatch to check on my heartbeat, mileage and calorie burn.</p><p>Eventually I realized I was quite lost. That was not a serious problem, of course—Google Maps came to my rescue.</p><p>But something bothered me. In what I'd intended as a pristine nature experience, here I was using very high technology indeed to bail myself out. (Google Maps relies on the Global Positioning System, or GPS—itself a master class in modern physics that involves sophisticated orchestration of space satellites, atomic clocks and electromagnetic waves.) This small epiphany triggered a reconsideration of everything that happened during my \"nature walk.\" The walk had been technologically enhanced every step of the way. I'd been functioning as a man-machine hybrid: a cyborg.</p><p>What would Henry David Thoreau, the inspiring patron saint of those same woods, who championed direct experience, think of that?</p><p>My first thought was that he'd be appalled. But later I did some research. Thoreau reveled in his spyglass's revelations, like this eagle from his \"Journal\":</p><p>\"Lying on the ground with my glass, I could watch him very easily, and by turns he gave me all possible views of his wings curved upward slightly the more, like a stereotyped undulation. He rose very high at last, till I almost lost him in the clouds, circling or rather looping along westward, high over river and wood and farm, effectually concealed in the sky. We who live this plodding life here below never know how many eagles fly over us. They are concealed in the empyrean. I think I have got the worth of my glass now that it has revealed to me the white-headed eagle.\"</p><p>Famously, Thoreau always set out equipped with a notched walking staff, which he used not only for support but also to take measurements of water and snow levels. His hat, he wrote, was a tool:</p><p>\"... attending to plants with more method, looking out the name of each one and remembering it. I began to bring them home in my hat, a straw one with a scaffold lining to it, which I called my botany-box.\"</p><p>And unlike his less-equipped friends, he was prepared for adversity:</p><p>\" They all tore their clothes badly but myself, and I, who, it chanced, was the only one provided with needles and thread…When we came out of the woods, I was the best dressed of any of them.\"</p><p>Clearly, Thoreau was a bit of a cyborg himself.</p><p>Thinking more deeply, I pondered how far we walkers have come from our \"natural\" condition. Not only our gadgets but even the store of food that sustains us is the product of many machines and complex supply chains, as well as human labor. We've come a long way from our hunter-gatherer ancestors, who walked from necessity and relied on nature's endowment. Cyborgs are us.</p><p>We Are All Cyborgs</p>",
