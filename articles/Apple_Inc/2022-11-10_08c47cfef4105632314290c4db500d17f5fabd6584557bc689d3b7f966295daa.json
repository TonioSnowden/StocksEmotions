  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  This would have been so much easier in the metaverse. </p><p>\n  The company once known as Facebook announced layoffs Wednesday, in a letter to employees from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. The action will cut the size of Meta Platforms' workforce by 13% -- about 11,000 employees. That sounds big because it is. Facebook has never done a major retrenchment in its 18-year history, since the bulk of that history involved double-digit growth and sky-high operating margins. They enabled the company to draw workers by the thousands every year. </p><p>\n  But 11,000 workers is about 4,000 fewer than the number that Meta hired since the start of this year, when some problems were apparent. One is the company's core advertising business was slipping, hurt by a combination of factors including a slowing economy, competition from TikTok and changes by Apple that Facebook refers to as \"signal loss\" -- meaning less ability to track the activity of users for the purpose of selling them targeted ads. In early February, Meta reported ad revenue grew 20% year over year during the fourth quarter -- 10 points below what it averaged over the previous eight periods -- and its first ever decline in daily active users. The news cost the company more than one-quarter of its market value the following day. </p><p>\n  Another thing apparent early on was that investors were taking a pretty dim view of Mr. Zuckerberg's plan to transform Facebook into a \"metaverse\" company. The move, which included the company's renaming, was announced in late October of last year. Six months later, Meta's share price was down 34% -- more than double the 15% drop averaged by peers Microsoft, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet over the same span. </p><p>\n  Meta's stock jumped more than 5% Wednesday on the layoff news, but investors cheering the belated attention to cost control should be wary. Its business relies on users of its Facebook and Instagram apps checking in every day, and that future is far from certain as new time drains like TikTok take hold. Facebook in particular faces substantial questions about privacy, security and political disinformation on the platform. </p><p>\n  The company wasn't terribly inefficient before the recent cuts, either. Meta was generating about $1.35 million in annual revenue per employee as of the end of the third quarter, putting it in the upper fifth of the S&amp;P 500 and in fifth place among tech companies on the index, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. </p><p>\n  In his letter Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg took responsibility for his failure to curb the company's costs earlier. But the billionaire remains hot on the metaverse, and only vaguely hinted he might consider reducing the company's blowout capital spending meant to fuel that vision. </p><p>\n  And while some shareholders might remain unhappy with the new direction, they have little recourse. Even in its new form, the old Facebook remains a controlled company through its co-founder's supervoting stake. For better or worse, Mr. Zuckerberg's job is fully secure. </p><p></p>",
