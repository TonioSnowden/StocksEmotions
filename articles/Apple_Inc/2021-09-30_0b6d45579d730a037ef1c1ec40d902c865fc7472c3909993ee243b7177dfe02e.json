  "title": "North Korea Sees U.S. as Ongoing Threat, Kim Jong Un Says in Speech; The North Korean leader ordered officials to protect the country's sovereignty days after missile launch",
  "text": "<p>\"The U.S. is touting 'diplomatic engagement' and 'dialogue without preconditions,'\" Mr. Kim said, \"but it is no more than a petty trick for deceiving the international community and hiding its hostile acts.\"</p><p>The State Department said the U.S. harbors no hostile intent toward North Korea and remains ready to meet without preconditions. \"We hope the DPRK will respond positively to our outreach,\" it said in a statement, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Kim expressed a desire to restore an inter-Korean hotline in early October, a move that could help repair frayed ties with Seoul. His younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was also promoted to the country's top policy-making body, the State Affairs Commission.</p><p>The Kim regime in recent weeks has conducted three weapons tests. That includes a Tuesday launch of a new hypersonic missile, which is designed to travel roughly a mile per second. It appears, though, to be in an early stage of development.</p><p>Mr. Kim hasn't commented much this year about U.S. relations, a contrast with his relationship with former President Donald Trump, with whom the North Korean leader exchanged warm letters and met face-to-face three times.</p><p>In January, shortly before Mr. Biden took office, Mr. Kim called the U.S. the country's biggest enemy and promised that Pyongyang's approach wouldn't change no matter who was president.</p><p>Then in June, Mr. Kim, making his first remarks about U.S. policy since Mr. Biden took office, kept his options open. The country should be ready for both dialogue and confrontation, he said.</p><p>North Korea has signaled its patience for talks has worn thin and has ignored outreach from the Biden administration. Senior officials, including Mr. Kim, have insisted that the nation would remain uninterested in diplomacy until the U.S. makes moves like canceling joint military exercises with South Korea or removing economic sanctions.</p><p>In his policy speech, Mr. Kim criticized the U.S. and South Korea for an \"excessive arms buildup\" that is destroying stability and balance on the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Kim also cast doubts on South Korean President Moon Jae-in's recent suggestion of a peace declaration that could end the Korean War.</p><p>Even with such an agreement, Mr. Kim said, hostile acts would continue, so long as there remains \"the apple of distrust and confrontation between the North and South.\" He also blamed Seoul for clamoring for international cooperation \"in servitude to the U.S.\"</p><p>The inter-Korean hotline was revived in late July but communications were cut again after roughly two weeks, as Pyongyang protested joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises occurring around that time.</p><p>South Korea's unification ministry on Thursday expressed hope that a resumption of hotline communications will help facilitate progress on a variety of issues between the two countries.</p><p>Though the hotline does serve a practical purpose—providing an outreach channel to avoid potential misunderstandings—North Korea's strategic waffling between accepting, or ignoring, such communication is pure emotional manipulation of South Korea, said Jean H. Lee, a senior fellow at the Korea program at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington.</p><p>\"The uncertainty over something as simple as whether the North Koreans will pick up the phone highlights how unreliable Pyongyang is as a partner,\" Ms. Lee said. \"I don't see how you can trust them to honor an end-of-war declaration as proposed by Seoul.\"</p><p>Kim Yo Jong, in recent days, had floated the prospects of an inter-Korean summit contingent on Seoul demonstrating mutual respect and impartiality.</p><p>Even before her new promotion, Ms. Kim has seen her role elevated in recent years, becoming the regime's mouthpiece for U.S. and South Korean affairs. Though not viewed as an officially designated heir, Ms. Kim is a confidante of her brother and Seoul's intelligence agency believes she is a de facto No. 2.</p><p>Some notable figures were booted off North Korea's powerful State Affairs Commission, including Pak Pong Ju, who was the policy group's vice president, and Choe Son Hui, a senior diplomat who is one of the North's most prominent interlocutors with the U.S.</p><p>The fall of Ms. Choe could be another example of Mr. Kim using a reshuffling of personnel to act as communication \"pegs,\" clarifying the direction of a policy and expressing his dissatisfaction with the U.S., said Soo Kim, a North Korea expert at Rand Corp., a think tank based in Santa Monica, Calif.</p><p>\"Take down Choe for now because Pyongyang's game with Washington has turned sour—and Kim probably sees few prospects for this game to improve,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Timothy W.
