  "title": "Amazon Share Price Surges Following Bumper Earnings; Tech stocks have diverged this earnings season as investors subject results to greater scrutiny",
  "text": "<p>In another outsize move, Snap Inc. leapt 43%, more than unwinding a 24% slide for the stock Thursday, when Meta's earnings prompted investors to dump social-media companies.</p><p>Prompting the turnaround: Snap posted its first quarterly profit. The image-sharing firm also signaled it is adjusting to disruptions in the digital-advertising market caused by Apple Inc. privacy-policy changes that are affecting Meta.</p><p>Pinterest Inc. reversed course, too, climbing 4% following a 10% skid in Thursday's regular session. After markets closed, Pinterest reported a 20% rise in sales in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.</p><p>Companies such as Apple, Microsoft Corp., Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Meta—the top five constituents on the S&amp;P 500 benchmark index by weighting as of Feb. 2—have powered the stock market higher in recent years. Their fortunes have gone in different directions this results season as investors, gearing up for higher interest rates, subject earnings to greater scrutiny.</p><p>The tech giants have become so big that their moves can cause swings in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, whose members are weighted by market capitalization. As of Feb. 2, the top five, combined with Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp., accounted for more than 26% of the weighting of the S&amp;P 500, according to S&amp;P Global.</p><p>Amazon's rally looked set to help the market regain some lost ground Friday. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.4% and the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 rose 0.6%.</p><p>The e-commerce stock climbed before the bell after the company reported $137.4 billion in quarterly revenue, up from $125.6 billion a year earlier. Profit rose to $14.3 billion, from $7.2 billion, demonstrating that Amazon managed labor and supply costs more successfully than investors had anticipated.</p><p>Apple shares rose 7% on Jan. 28 after the company's quarterly results shattered previous records. Shares of Microsoft have been steady since the software company said in late January that its net income rose 21% in the final quarter of 2021 from a year before. Google parent Alphabet has risen after saying profit rose by a third in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Meta, in contrast, lost $232 billion in market value Thursday, the biggest one-day decline for a stock in U.S. history. The company had said it expected revenue growth to slow because users were spending less time on more lucrative services.</p><p>PayPal Holdings Inc. and Spotify Technology SA have also sagged in recent days after posting quarterly results.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon Share Price Surges Following Bumper Earnings</p>",
