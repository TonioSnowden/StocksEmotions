  "text": "<p>Aura Kavadlo first saw the pink flesh of the Pinkglow pineapple on Instagram. The price—$50 each—stopped the St. Louis jewelry designer from making the purchase. \"I felt the despair,\" she says. \"I knew that I'm never going to spend $50 on the fruit.\"</p><p>Months later she spotted the pineapple, launched by Fresh Del Monte in 2020, at her local grocer for $15, compared with $4 for regular ones. At that price, she bit. Her 23-year-old son came for dinner to try it.</p><p>\"It was like ceremonial at my house because we waited so long,\" the mother of three says. The verdict? \"It tasted like a pineapple. But it was a great pineapple.\"</p><p>Interest in boutique berries comes at the same time that inflation is causing shoppers to switch brands and clip coupons. Yet since the early stages of the pandemic, customers have been seeking novelty in their weekly grocery haul, stores say.</p><p>Boutique premium fruit typically tastes better and has more-consistent quality than regular produce, grocers and industry experts say, but can cost double or more than nonpremium counterparts. For stores, high-end produce draws in shoppers and signals a commitment to fresh food.</p><p>\"It sets the quality halo for the rest of the shopping experience,\" says Karl Zimmermann, a Bain &amp; Co. partner who works with the consulting firm's retail and performance-improvement practices.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How much are you willing to spend on fruit? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Making Driscoll's Rosé Raspberries or a Sumo Citrus mandarin requires heavy marketing investment in catchy names and branding campaigns, as well as intellectual property and trademark protections, says Miguel Gómez, food marketing professor at Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.</p><p>\"All the names are very sensorial,\" he says.</p><p>Apples alone have enough brands and varieties that a review website, Applerankings.com, offers opinions to help consumers assess options before they buy. The Cosmic Crisp is proclaimed to be \"the most overhyped apple of all time.\" And the SnapDragon is a \"chomp-worthy newcomer.\" The Jonagold apple is deemed \"a forgettable college friend.\"</p><p>Last month Harps Food Stores, with stores across Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Kansas, introduced the Pink-A-Boo Pineberry, a white strawberry with a hint of pineapple flavor. The box of a dozen berries from Wish Farms sells for $6, roughly 30% more than conventional strawberries. The company offers cheaper introductory pricing to draw in shoppers.</p><p>\"We have to get it into the consumer's mouth so they come back and buy it,\" says Mike Roberts, vice president of produce operations at Harps Food Stores. It's working. White strawberry sales at Harps have been on par with those of blackberries sold at the store.</p><p>Social media has helped spread the word about Oishii, which offers the strawberry at specialty markets in New York, New Jersey and California, with packs of eight large berries costing $50. Farmed indoors in Kearny, N.J., the berry is a Japanese variety bred to be sweeter. The company, named after the Japanese word for \"delicious,\" calls the fruit \"a rare and exceptional variety, once only found seasonally in the fields of the Japanese Alps.\"</p><p>Limited supply and continued buzz has meant Oishii sells out often, says Oishii Chief Executive Hiroki Koga. As growing technology evolves, he hopes to offer the berries in more supermarkets at slightly lower prices.</p><p>\"We are not trying to become a Ferrari, but we are trying to become a Tesla,\" he says.</p><p>Occasions like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day helped spur sales of Pinkglow pineapples, says Jesus Rodriguez Calvo, senior vice president of sales and marketing for North America at Fresh Del Monte. The pineapple promises to have no acidic aftertaste. The fruit is also shipped in its own pink and yellow box with a card. \"There's a festivity around Pinkglow,\" he says.</p><p>After seeking out what she calls \"crazy fruit\" during the pandemic, Alexis Cruz was thrilled to find the pink-fleshed Hidden Rose apple by Dragonberry Produce at her local grocer. She had heard about the hints of pink lemonade in the apple and paid $5 for one.</p><p>It was fine but nothing special, says the 26-year-old production assistant in Los Angeles. \"I can eat this and I can put it on Instagram, but it's an apple.\"</p><p>Kristy Couch, 34, a benefits consultant from Concord, N.C., first heard about Cotton Candy grapes in a Weight Watchers group on Facebook. It took her nearly two years to find them. The pale green color \"didn't look that appetizing\" when she finally spotted them at the store, but she bought them anyway, paying $2 more than the other green grapes for sale. She remembers her first bite: \"Oh, my God, this really does taste like cotton candy.\"</p><p>For now, she's unlikely to swap it for her go-to, a crisp green grape that doesn't feel \"like eating candy,\" she says. \"I don't know that I'd keep spending $5 on a handful,\" she adds.</p><p>Grapery, which started selling Cotton Candy grapes in 2011, offered another branded grape, the pinky-shaped purple grapes they dubbed Witch Fingers, some years ago. After marketing-related setbacks and a few poor crop seasons, this year they are planning to sell a similarly shaped green variety with a changed name—Tear Drops, says Jim Beagle, chief executive of the Shafter, Calif., company.</p><p>\"Half of consumers refused to try a grape with the name 'finger' in it,\" he says.</p><p>What Is an Oishii Strawberry, and Would You Pay $6 for One?
