  "text": "<p>Markets have bounced back and forth this week in reaction to pandemic headlines. Wall Street lost ground Wednesday after the first Omicron case was identified in the U.S., but on Thursday, traders were focused on comments from the World Health Organization's chief scientist suggesting vaccines were likely to still offer some protection.</p><p>Shares of Vir Biotechnology jumped close to 12% premarket after the biotech firm and partner GlaxoSmithKline said their Covid-19 antibody drug was effective against the Omicron variant in early laboratory studies. Meanwhile, officials said President Biden planned to tighten Covid-19 testing timelines for travelers entering the U.S. and extend a mask mandate on transportation.</p><p>\"People are still dealing with uncertainty about Omicron and how much of a threat it poses,\" said Salman Baig, a multiasset investment manager at Unigestion. \"Some might see this as a buy the dip opportunity. But it wouldn't surprise me if the market action reverses or loses steam later today.\"</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 1.427%, declining for a third day. The yield curve has flattened this week, with shorter-dated bond yields rising and longer-dated ones ticking down. Markets are still reacting to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week that suggested the central bank was prepared to accelerate tapering, said Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco.</p><p>Shares of WeWork dropped 2.6% in premarket trading. The office-sharing company said that it would restate several quarters of its results, including its latest one, and that there was a material weakness in its internal controls. Apple declined 3.1% after Bloomberg reported that the company had said demand for iPhones was lower than expected ahead of the holiday season.</p><p>Dollar General shares fell 2.8% premarket after the company said its profit fell in the third quarter and cut its full-year guidance for same-store sales. Food retailer Kroger climbed 5.8% after it raised its full-year guidance. Boeing climbed 5.5% after China's aviation authority issued a directive on the 737 MAX, bringing the plane a step closer to returning to Chinese skies.</p><p>Weekly jobless claims came in at 222,000, a rise from the previous week. This was still lower than economists had expected, as employers held on to workers in a tight labor market.</p><p>Global oil benchmark Brent crude wavered between small gains and losses, trading at around $69 a barrel. Traders are awaiting signals from OPEC and its allies about whether the group will halt planned production increases. Ministers are scheduled to speak Thursday.</p><p>Bitcoin extended losses into a third consecutive day, trading at around $56,550, down 0.8% from its level at 5 p.m. Wednesday. Overseas, the Turkish lira fell 1.4% to trade at 13.5 lira to $1, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan named a loyalist as the new finance minister.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 1.5%. Swiss drugmaker Vifor Pharma jumped over 18% on reports that biotech firm CSL may acquire it.</p><p>\"It does seem like European countries are a bit more reactive to Covid news. We expect European stocks to be more sensitive to what's going on with Omicron, or Covid broadly,\" Mr. Baig said. \"Right now we have a significant preference for U.S. equities over European.\"</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index ticked down 0.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.7%, with SoftBank closing down over 5%. Shares of the technology-investment firm have fallen for five straight days due to declines in some of its portfolio companies, such as Alibaba, WeWork and DoorDash.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Mostly Rise After Omicron-Driven Selloff</p>",
