  "text": "<p>   Former President Donald Trump and his diminishing MAGA legions are now worse than losers, for they have become boring (\"Can Trump Change His Stripes?\" by Daniel Henninger, Wonder Land, Nov. 17). It's the Charge of the Lightheaded Brigade: Theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and (electorally) die. </p><p>   Mr. Trump is an albatross now, no longer a warhorse. But he is relentless, his ego directing another run for Oval Office gold. He is like an old entertainer responding to the smell of greasepaint even though audiences are dwindling and catcalls resounding. And while he has a good chance to win enough primaries to wrest the nomination from more reasonable and temperate candidates, that will happen only if his base remains solid and opposition candidates splinter the non-Trump vote. I suspect such a candidacy will lose again irrespective of a change of stripes for, while Americans are responsive to confession and repentance, those features would be uncongenial to his base. </p><p>   Paul Bloustein </p><p>   Cincinnati </p><p></p>",
