  "title": "The Field by Robert Seethaler — life lessons from beyond the grave",
  "text": "<p>When Robert Seethaler's <em>A Whole Life</em> was shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize in 2016, it sparked something of a renaissance for novellas. An array of 20th-century authors, from Hemingway and Steinbeck to Tove Jansson and Penelope Fitzgerald, created modern classics with the short form, but in recent decades publishers have taken the view that more is more. So, when Seethaler expertly condensed the life of an Alpine mountaineer into 150 pages, it was a revelation to some.</p> <p>“Every life, when you look back on it, reduces itself to a few moments,” Seethaler noted when that book was published. The author further explores this maxim in his new — again short — novel <em>The Field</em>, in which he tells the story of the fictional town of Paulstadt through the staccato testimonies of those buried in its cemetery.</p> <p>At the novel's opening an anonymous old man sits under the graveyard's birch tree and considers the characters beneath his feet, townsfolk steeped in “damp earth and elderflower”. What would they say, he wonders, “if each voice were to have the chance to be heard once more”? Gradually, these lost souls — a flamboyant owner of a shoe shop, a local reporter, a womanising mayor, and many more — create a patchwork portrait of a community.</p> <p>Each chapter is titled with the deceased's name and, although no dates are given, carefully dispersed details — from the arrival of streetlamps on Marktstrasse to the introduction of slot machines in the tavern — create a timeline that spans the past century. Placed together, the voices provide a tragicomic chorus. The departed range from an inquisitive child who perished in his pursuit of nature to a centenarian mourning, from beyond the grave, the demise of the town band.</p> <p>The style of their deliveries also varies: some talk directly to a loved one, others play to a crowd, some ramble, others fixate. One woman provides a gleeful account of her sex life; the pompous mayor projects like he's up for re-election. And they flit between the present and the past tense, fluctuations that are ably handled by Charlotte Collins' translation and which underline the sense of limbo. </p> <p>Religion is little more than an absurd aside in this existential tale. The fire-and-brimstone zeal of the town's Catholic priest tips over into madness and the jovial Muslim greengrocer discovers that for years his prayer rug has been facing his vegetables rather than Mecca. While Seethaler shows how happiness can bubble up from unexpected sources, he also delivers some breathtakingly sad moments.</p> <p>Seethaler, cleverly and incrementally, brings the topography of the town into focus. Gerd Ingerland, Paulstadt's diligent postman, recalls his whistle-stop rounds in “a town where you can walk from north to south in 25 minutes, west to east in less than 20.” He passes “new houses on old foundations, like crowns on broken teeth” and the school playground where “the chewing gum of generations of schoolchildren had softened on the asphalt”. He remembers how his bag was lighter on the road where the old people lived. </p> <p>As the town's skyline — where “bats reeled over the chimneys at dusk like small, drunken shadows” — changes, so too do the attitudes and worries of its occupants. A pair of stories follow the trajectory of a family of strong-willed women, from the grandmother who endured a wartime death march to her granddaughter's struggle with a slacker boyfriend.</p> <p>Seethaler underscores the cyclical nature of both communal and personal histories. In Paulstadt, rumours and reputations get passed around town and over generations. One late resident, the list-making KP Lindow, concludes his tally of obsessions, from his revenge fantasies to his collection of corkscrews, with a sharp universal truth: “Gradually, imperceptibly, the longing for first times transforms into hoping for last ones.”</p> <p>There are echoes of Garrison Keillor's whimsical Midwest settlement Lake Wobegon to Seethaler's rural town. But there is a more jagged edge to the Austrian's writing than that of his American counterpart. What might have been a collection of quirky vignettes is instead a moving study of how all lives boil down to a handful of choices, often made by others. This is a quietly profound novel made all the more beautiful by its brevity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1529008050?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1529008050\"><strong>The Field</strong></a> by Robert Seethaler, translated by Charlotte Collins<em>, Picador, RRP£14.99, 240 pages</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
