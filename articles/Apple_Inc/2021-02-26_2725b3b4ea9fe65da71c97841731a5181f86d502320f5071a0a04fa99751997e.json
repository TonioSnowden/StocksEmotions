  "title": "Max Clifford: The Fall of a Tabloid King paints a portrait of a predator",
  "text": "<p>Chat show host Terry Wogan definitely had a twinkle in his eye when he introduced Max Clifford, PR consultant to the stars, as the “keeper of the flame of truth”, but his guest might well have accepted the tribute at face value. Such was the man's confounding hypocrisy that Clifford was able to maintain a facade of sheer outrage when asked about the crimes of Gary Glitter, while, it turned out, being a sex offender himself. The most sinister thing about Clifford's excoriation of paedophiles is how genuine he sounds. </p> <p>Lacking the sheer gloating wickedness of Jimmy Savile, Clifford's inner being is hard to fathom. By confining itself to the story of his fall from grace, the film offers few insights into the development of his twisted psyche, but if we needed any more evidence about the rot pervading the entertainment industry over the last half-century, it's here. Clifford abused young and underage girls for decades (between 1966 and 1985 according to the charge sheet). His take on his own profession seems to come closest to an explanation, for in the service of his famous clients no lie was too low. </p> <p>Clifford was cosy with the tabloids and TV producers, with an ability to magic up readers and viewers. The career-boosting headline “Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster” was one infamous fib. Former Tory Minister David Mellor explains the Clifford method. The revelation that he was having an affair: true. That he made love wearing a Chelsea strip: ridiculous, humiliating and false. “Do you always tell the truth?” Clifford is asked on a TV show, getting a laugh with his short answer: “No.” </p> <p>Perhaps he was acting as his own PR man, covering up his crimes and peccadillos just as he would have done for a client. He wanted someone to write his biography because, Angela Levin says, “that's what great men have”. She conducted hours of interviews with Clifford and was staggered to hear revelations of affairs, sex parties, voyeurism, adultery and procurement almost as soon as she switched on the tape. “I had my cake and I had everyone else's cake as well,” he bragged. It was “a very strange thing to want as a priority in your book,” Levin reflects. </p> <p>His downfall was Operation Yewtree, the investigation into historical sexual abuse, where Clifford had the brass nerve to represent one of Glitter's accusers. Watching, an outraged “Kate” was emboldened to tell the police what had happened to her as a teenager, her account quickly corroborated by others. Right up to the end he was performing, turning up to court every day as though he was the celebrity witness, not the defendant.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Channel 4 from March 1 at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
