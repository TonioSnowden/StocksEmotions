  "text": "<p>Commercial landlord Landsec has bought a stake in the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, in a deal that demonstrates how far and fast values for this sort of property have fallen in recent years. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 group, which already owns almost a third of the mall, paid £172m to Lendlease Retail Partnership for its 25 per cent stake in Bluewater, implying a total valuation for the shopping centre of £688m.&#xa0;</p> <p>That is less than a third of its implied valuation of £2.19bn in 2014, when Landsec <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce194008-fc20-11e3-ad9b-00144feab7de\">bought a 30 per cent stake</a> from Lendlease for £656m. As part of that deal, Landsec paid an additional £40m for the land surrounding Bluewater and the right to manage the centre.</p> <p>With tenants including Apple, John Lewis, Primark and Zara and within striking distance of London, Bluewater is considered one of the UK's “prime” shopping centres. It is one of the largest in the UK and receives tens of millions of visitors a year.</p> <p>But it has not been immune to the value destruction that has hit the sector over the past decade as online shopping has surged. </p> <p>The pandemic accelerated ecommerce further and has been a boon for online retailers such as Amazon, worsening problems for malls and high streets. It has also kept shops shut for long periods, making it hard for shopping centre tenants to pay rent. </p> <p>In June 2020, just three months after the first UK lockdown, shopping centre landlord Intu <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97b54a02-4ccf-4ac5-b31c-03e71a9abc40\">fell into administration</a>.</p> <p>But last month, Landsec posted its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2db2c6c-10b8-4c1d-b911-32551fecc624\">first profit</a> of the pandemic period thanks to a recovery in office and retail park values. Its investment in Bluewater signals the company's belief that the market has stopped falling. </p> <p>“Pre-pandemic there was a tough trend [in retail] and then the freefall of valuation during the pandemic was startling for the industry. But rents have fallen and are sustainable at today's levels. We're seeing the opportunity,” said Bruce Findlay, managing director of retail at Landsec. </p> <p>The Lendlease deal simplified the ownership of Bluewater, said Findlay, and it would now look to renovate the centre and tilt the mix of tenants further towards leisure and hospitality, which currently account for about 20 per cent of space.</p> <p>“Overall investment in the next two years will be £100m across the whole shopping centre and outlet estate, and Bluewater will be a big part of that . . . It's a sign of our commitment to the sector, we're really all in,” he said.</p> <p>Since he was appointed in April 2020, Landsec chief executive Mark Allan has indicated that he sees value in physical shops and is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc67660d-9653-43e7-9a35-17ca1a2bcdd3\">pursuing a strategy</a> of investing in big shopping centres. </p> <p>Regional shopping centres and retail outlets make up some 15 per cent of Landsec's £11bn portfolio. The majority of its assets are London offices. </p> <p>Mike Prew, an analyst at Jefferies, noted that Landsec's investment in Bluewater could drag down the overall valuation of its retail properties and the sector more broadly, because the £172m purchase price was at a roughly 20 per cent discount to the value assigned to the stake it already owned when it published its full-year accounts in March this year.</p><p>Source: George Hammond 2021 'Landsec's Bluewater deal highlights falls in shopping centre values' FT.com 22 December.
