  "text": "<p>China reported more than 24,000 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, according to data from the National Health Commission on Friday, edging closer to the high point seen during Shanghai's monthslong lockdown earlier this year. Infections were recorded all over the country, with numbers rising in two-thirds of the provincial-level regions.</p><p>Beijing reported more than 450 new cases, close to Monday's record and bringing total cases in the country's capital to almost 2,500 since the government unveiled a raft of measures aimed at easing the impact from stringent pandemic controls. Zhengzhou—where Apple Inc. supplier Foxconn Technology Group has faced an outbreak at the world's biggest iPhone assembly plant—found more than 1,600 new infections, with almost 4,700 new cases detected in China's southwestern metropolis of Chongqing.</p><p>Guangzhou, the provincial capital of China's manufacturing powerhouse Guangdong, had the highest tally, with more than 9,000 new cases among its 19 million residents.</p><p>China's leadership issued a notice last Friday that instructed local governments to ease Covid controls, cut the length of quarantines and reduce unnecessary mass testing.</p><p>But recent editorials in The People's Daily—the Chinese Communist Party's flagship publication—continued to call on China's population to stick with its approach of staying vigilant and nipping outbreaks in the bud.</p><p>The mixed messaging has left local governments trying to figure out how to handle Covid cases without resorting to the most stringent measures of China's zero-tolerance approach to the virus.</p><p>At Thursday's briefing, Beijing also unveiled plans for the hospital system to deal with a surge of new infections by building more facilities for treating severe Covid cases, and to ensure that intensive-care units account for 10% of all hospital beds to tend to the most vulnerable patients.</p><p>China has relaxed the categories of people that need to be isolated in response to last Friday's loosening instructions, but it still requires every single infection and their close contacts to enter enforced quarantine.</p><p>On Thursday, Guangzhou announced plans to add beds for nearly a quarter of a million people to handle surging infections, including 132,015 in hospital isolation wards and 114,392 for people who are infected but have no symptoms.</p><p>Sudden and sometimes prolonged closures of workplaces, schools and neighborhoods have been fueling frustration and protests across China this year.</p><p>On Thursday, public anger welled up again over a child's death that was blamed on excessive pandemic measures. A 4-month-old girl died after suffering vomiting and diarrhea while in quarantine at a hotel in Zhengzhou, according to local news reports.</p><p>Emergency services had balked at treating her on Monday because the father had tested positive with the virus, the reports said, citing an account of the incident posted on social media by her father. The girl was sent to a hospital 11 hours after he first called, but died despite efforts to revive her, the reports said.</p><p>The Zhengzhou health commission said it was investigating the incident, according to the reports.</p><p>Write to Sha Hua at sha.hua@wsj.com</p><p>China's New Daily Covid Cases Jump Above 24,000</p>",
