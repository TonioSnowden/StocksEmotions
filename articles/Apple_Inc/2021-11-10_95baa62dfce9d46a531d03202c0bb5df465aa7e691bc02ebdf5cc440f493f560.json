  "title": "Stocks Close Lower, Bond Yields Rise After Inflation Hits 30-Year High; Investors scrutinize inflation data with an eye to future interest-rate policy",
  "text": "<p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 dropped 38.54 points, or 0.8%, to 4646.71, a second down day after an eight-session streak of record closes. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240.04 points, or 0.7%, to 36079.94. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 263.84 points, or 1.7%, to 15622.71.</p><p>Investors' eyes were on fresh data showing U.S. inflation rose in October to its highest level since 1990, driven by supply shortages and strong consumer demand. The annual rate of inflation stood at 6.2%.</p><p>Yields on shorter-term U.S. government bonds rose, suggesting bond investors expect the increases in consumer prices may prompt the Federal Reserve to more quickly raise interest rates. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose to 0.503%, from 0.409% Tuesday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, meanwhile, rose to 1.558%. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p><p>Stocks have charted a rapid course higher in recent weeks, boosted by a strong batch of corporate earnings. Markets are showing \"stubborn resilience\" despite inflation concerns and the prospect of tightening monetary policy, said Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at Moneta Group.</p><p>\"Inflation is very much here, and arguably not transitory, but markets don't seem to be too concerned about that,\" she said.</p><p>The inflation data shows that companies have succeeded in passing price increases on to consumers, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.</p><p>\"Large public companies have pricing power,\" she said. \"Inflation is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks, particularly if the Fed doesn't react.\"</p><p>Energy stocks were the worst-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, dropping 3% as oil prices declined. Technology stocks also fell, with Apple shares down $2.89, or 1.9%, to $147.92 and Microsoft shares down $5.15, or 1.5%, to $330.80. Rising yields tend to hurt tech stocks, which often trade at high prices based in part on projections of growth far into the future.</p><p>\"The higher interest rates are, the less valuable those future cash flows, those future earnings, are for growth stocks,\" said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer at Mercer Advisors.</p><p>Among individual stocks, shares of Coinbase Global fell $28.79, or 8.1%, to $328.60 after the cryptocurrency exchange reported earnings late Tuesday that missed analysts' expectations. DoorDash shares rose $22.23, or 12%, to $214.24 after the company said it had agreed to buy Finnish food-delivery firm Wolt Enterprises in a deal valued at over $8 billion.</p><p>Tesla shares steadied after their recent declines, adding $44.45, or 4.3%, to $1067.95. The electric-vehicle maker's shares had declined 12% Tuesday, extending Monday's losses after Chief Executive Elon Musk signaled he might sell a big chunk of his stock.</p><p>Shares of electric-vehicle startup Rivian Automotive jumped in their market debut, rising 29% from the initial public offering price.</p><p>Chinese economic data released Wednesday added to inflation concerns. Factory-gate prices in China rose at a record pace in October, due in part to surging energy costs. The nation's producer-price index rose by a record 13.5% from a year earlier.</p><p>In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4%, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.7%. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.6%. Europe's pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.2%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Close Lower, Bond Yields Rise After Inflation Hits 30-Year High</p>",
