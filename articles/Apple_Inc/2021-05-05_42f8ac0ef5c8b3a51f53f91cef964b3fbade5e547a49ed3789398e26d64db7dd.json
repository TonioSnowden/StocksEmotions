  "text": "<p>The past 16 months linger in the mind watching mordant Greek puzzler <em>Apples</em>, a tale of society in the grip of a pandemic. Theirs is stranger than ours, however — an outbreak of amnesia drizzled over a grey-sky Athens. Not everyone is vulnerable, but for those who are, the wipe-clean is total. Take the allegory any way you want. </p> <p>At first, director Christos Nikou simply focuses on cerebral slapstick. A traffic jam builds up after a motorist abandons his car, suddenly at a loss as to how to drive it. Another unfortunate reaches the last stop on a bus route. Shortly after getting on, he just forgot where he was going. This hapless figure — lean and doleful, played by Aris Servetalis — becomes our hero. He is taken to hospital, where no relatives claim him. It is possible, the doctors smile sadly, that they too have now forgotten he exists.</p> <p>Film-making can be contagious as well. Nikou formerly worked as an assistant to Yorgos Lanthimos, the director whose 2018 awards magnet <em>The Favourite</em> followed a series of chilly, funny, deeply unrelaxed art house hits. Apples is sweeter but shares a lot with the film Lanthimos and Nikou made together, the gloriously spiky <em>Dogtooth</em>. As it was there, the tone is angular, the setting a present untouched by digital technology — cassette recorders and Polaroids feature heavily. The film proceeds in skits; the drollery fractionally wears thin. Then comes the entrance of Anna (Sofia Georgovassili) — a matching amnesiac and a beginning again both for Servetalis and <em>Apples</em>. The question of what we might be when we can't remember who we are is made fresh once more. The answer, not so weirdly, is altogether moving. </p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Curzon Home Cinema in the UK from May 7</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Apples — a memorable story of forgetting' FT.com 5 May.
