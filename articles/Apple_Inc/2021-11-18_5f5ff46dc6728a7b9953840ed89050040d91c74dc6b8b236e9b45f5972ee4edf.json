At least 10 people died and two dozen were hospitalized after a crowd surge at the Houston event. </p><p>\n  Attorneys for Mr. Scott didn't respond to a request for comment Wednesday. His lawyers have previously said the artist didn't know what was happening in the crowd of more than 50,000. Representatives for Drake, whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>\n  Representatives for Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. A representative for Live Nation said the company \"will address all legal matters at the appropriate time.\" </p><p>\n  -- Jennifer Calfus </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  MEMPHIS </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Rapper Young Dolph, </p><p>\n  36, Shot to Death </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Rapper Young Dolph was shot and killed in Memphis Wednesday. He was 36 years old. </p><p>\n  \"To honor all victims of violent crime, I ask for calm in our city to allow the Memphis Police Department to do their duty to capture those responsible,\" Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland said on Twitter. </p><p>\n  The Memphis police said in a tweet that a male victim was shot and pronounced dead at the address of Makeda's Homemade Butter Cookies. They said preliminary information indicated the victim was Adolph Robert Thornton Jr., Young Dolph's given name. </p><p>\n  Young Dolph's cousin, Mareno Myers, told the Daily Memphian newspaper that he was with the rapper when he was inside Makeda's. \"Somebody just rolled up on him and took his life,\" the cousin told the newspaper. </p><p>\n  Young Dolph released numerous mixtapes, starting with 2008's \"Paper Route Campaign,\" and studio albums, including his 2016 debut \"King of Memphis,\" according to the Associated Press. Three of his albums reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020's \"Rich Slave\" hitting No. 4. </p><p>\n  -- Joseph Pisani </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  PITTSBURGH </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Large Grant to Fund </p><p>\n  Biomedical Center </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Richard King Mellon Foundation announced a $100 million grant to fund a center for biomedical manufacturing, the latest piece in a plan to redevelop a stretch of riverfront outside Pittsburgh nearly half the size of the city's downtown. </p><p>\n  The 178-acre property known as Hazelwood Green is the site of a former LTV Steel mill that shut in the 1990s. The $100 million grant will fund a bio-manufacturing facility called the Pitt BioForge to be run by the University of Pittsburgh, with the aim of attracting companies that produce cell and gene therapies to treat cancer. </p><p>\n  Earlier this year, the foundation announced a $150 million grant to Carnegie Mellon University, half of which will fund centers for robotics and advanced manufacturing at Hazelwood Green. A startup incubator opened there in September in a restored train roundhouse. </p><p>\n  -- Kris Maher </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  COLORADO </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Evacuations Ordered </p><p>\n  As Wildfire Spreads </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A wildfire burning in northern Colorado prompted evacuation orders for residents near the base of Rocky Mountain National Park as firefighters worked to contain the blaze. </p><p>\n  The Kruger Rock Fire was sparked Tuesday morning after strong winds pushed a tree onto a power line, the Larimer County Sheriff's Office said. Flames grew rapidly in the area's steep terrain. </p><p>\n  The sheriff's office said it gave evacuation orders to 1,644 contacts during the day. </p><p>\n  Officials in Estes Park, a town of about 6,000 at the base of the nearby national park, said they were discouraging visitors. </p><p>\n  A pilot flying a single-engine air tanker helping with fire suppression efforts died in a crash Tuesday, the sheriff's office said. </p><p>\n  -- Jennifer Calfas </p><p></p>",
