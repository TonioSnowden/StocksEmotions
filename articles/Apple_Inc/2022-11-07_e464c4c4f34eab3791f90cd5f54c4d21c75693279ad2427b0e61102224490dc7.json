Can you imagine how much worse it will get?” says Mathai.</p> <p>But despite the urgent need for climate action, the effect of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine on the global economy means that wealthy nations have not been forthcoming with climate aid. “Their promise to funnel $100bn of climate aid a year to poor countries remains outstanding, as does a commitment to double funding for climate adaptation to $40bn by 2025,” writes Mance.</p> <p>Former British prime minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/532e3c47-e4cc-4e37-bc4a-4810b76d4a4b\">Boris Johnson told an event at COP27</a> today that the UK did “not have the financial resources” to pay “reparations” to low-income countries affected by climate change — despite admitting that, “per capita, people in the UK put a lot of carbon in the atmosphere”. </p> <p>Instead, he said net zero would have to be achieved through investment from the private sector in partnership with the international community.</p> <p>The US is working on a plan to harness cash from the world's largest companies to help developing countries cut their use of fossil fuels. The new framework would be for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf064250-e4ce-48c2-a4dd-dc96bc7660e2\">carbon credits to be sold to business</a>, with the proceeds used to fund new clean energy projects.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a43427ac-0e7e-48bf-8c3e-4165179afff4\">FT editorial board says</a> rich countries need to “dig deep enough into [their] pockets on funding for mitigation and adaptation” in order to “offset increasingly vocal calls from poorer nations for funding to cover loss and damage caused by warming”.</p> <p>As Mance points out, scientists have forecast that increased warming will make parts of sub-Saharan Africa unlivable this century, while agricultural productivity will fall in many areas. This may lead millions of climate migrants to head towards Europe, where governments are already struggling to handle migration from north Africa.</p> <p>In Italy, for example, the new rightwing government has pledged to curb illegal migration. Over the weekend it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a59acc21-08ad-42b1-ba1d-fd4c21b9066a\">blocked some migrants from disembarking</a> a rescue vessel at the port of Catania and ordered the ship to leave Italian waters.</p> <h1>Need to know: UK and Europe economy</h1> <p><strong>UK</strong> chancellor Jeremy Hunt is targeting a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cb99420-13a4-4ecd-b06d-16d812377a57\">£54bn fiscal tightening</a> in his Autumn Statement on November 17, with plans to cut £33bn in public spending while raising taxes by £21bn under draft proposals.
