  "text": "<p>The UK is poised to shelve plans to empower a new technology regulator, in a blow to global efforts to curb the dominance of internet companies, including Google and Facebook.</p> <p>The government's new legislative programme is not expected to include a bill to provide statutory underpinning to the digital markets unit that is based within the Competition and Markets Authority, said people briefed on the situation.</p> <p>Without the legislation the UK tech regulator will not be able to set rules for leading internet companies and impose fines on them for breaking those rules.</p> <p>The government announced plans to set up the digital markets unit in 2020 and said it would be given powers to devise codes of conduct for tech companies and fine those that did not comply up to 10 per cent of annual turnover.</p> <p>The unit was established in ‘shadow form' last year and is operating with around 60 staff, but has no powers beyond the Competition and Market Authority's existing capabilities.</p> <p>The Queen's Speech due on May 10, which will outline the government's legislative programme for the coming year, is not expected to include a bill that would provide the unit with statutory powers.</p> <p>It comes after the government dropped a bill from the Queen's Speech on long-delayed reform to audit and corporate governance following several corporate scandals.</p> <p>Tory officials said Boris Johnson was going cold on state intervention in the economy. David Canzini, the prime minister's deputy chief of staff, has told colleagues to scale back their legislative demands. “He's told us that Conservative governments don't legislate their way to prosperity and growth,” said one Conservative official.</p> <p>Julian Knight, Tory chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said if legislation to empower the tech regulator was not in the Queen's Speech it would “damage the credibility of the whole enterprise”.</p> <p>“It would be a hammer blow to the capability of the UK to regulate these sectors,” he added.</p> <p>The UK risks falling behind efforts by other countries to tackle the dominance of leading internet companies. This month the EU <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/031bba2b-87de-4adf-8cd7-a86a6e9b0b54\">approved a law</a> that set the rules on how companies should&#xa0;keep people safe on the internet.</p> <p>The original plans for the UK tech regulator were welcomed by sectors, including media companies, which were set to benefit from new rules of engagement between news publishers and internet groups such as Google and Facebook.</p> <p>The 60 staff in the digital markets unit are currently working on the CMA's existing probes, such as investigations into the terms of Apple's App store, as well as “ensuring the operational readiness of the digital markets unit”, according to a recruitment advert <a href=\"https://competitionandmarkets.blog.gov.uk/2022/01/07/cmas-digital-markets-unit-exciting-opportunities-to-influence-the-regulation-of-big-tech/\">posted in January</a>. </p> <p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it could “not comment on timelines for potential future legislation”. It added that the new UK regime affecting tech companies would “change the conduct of the most powerful tech firms and protect the businesses and consumers who rely on them&#xa0;right across the economy”. </p> <p>The CMA declined to comment. </p><p>Source: Kate Beioley, George Parker and Jim Pickard in London 2022 'UK ministers ditch plans to empower tech regulator ' FT.com 3 May.
