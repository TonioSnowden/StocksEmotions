  "text": "<p>   Two Magic Johnsons are currently competing in shows about the basketball star's career with the Los Angeles Lakers. </p><p>   In HBO's \"Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty\" -- a dramatization that has stirred controversy for its portrayals of key figures from the franchise -- an actor portrays Magic. In Apple's \"They Call Me Magic,\" a documentary whose producers include one of Mr. Johnson's business associates, the sports celebrity speaks for himself. </p><p>   Fact or fiction used to be the marker between documentaries and dramatizations designed for entertainment. But that distinction is getting closer scrutiny amid a rush of these projects, like the Michael Jordan docu-series \"The Last Dance\" or the fictionalized tennis world of \"King Richard.\" </p><p>   Rather than nonfiction vs. fiction, filmmakers say, the real tension now can be found between more official stories sanctioned by their subjects and heavily researched unofficial ones that attempt to capture larger truths. </p><p>   The two Lakers series deal with many of the same issues: Earvin Johnson's rise as a young NBA phenom, his NBA championship-winning rookie season, his relationship with teammate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, his sex life, his struggle between the public Magic and the private Earvin. </p><p>   Mr. Johnson has said he has no intention of watching \"Winning Time.\" Former Lakers head coach Jerry West, unhappy with his own portrayal, demanded an apology and a retraction from HBO, and Mr. Abdul-Jabbar railed against the series in an extended online essay. All three participated in \"They Call Me Magic.\" </p><p>   \"If you gathered the biggest gossip-mongers from the Real Housewives franchise,\" Mr. Abdul-Jabbar said, \"and they collected all the rumors they heard about each other from Twitter and then played Telephone with each other, you'd have the stitched together Frankenstein's monster that is this show.\" </p><p>   Attempts to reach Mr. Johnson were unsuccessful. </p><p>   \"Winning Time\" co-creator Max Borenstein said he spent three years researching the series, which is executive produced by filmmaker Adam McKay and based on Jeff Pearlman's book \"Showtime,\" a chronicle of the 1980s Lakers dynasty. Mr. Borenstein said the show uses multiple public accounts of that period from varying perspectives, including numerous memoirs and TV interviews, rather than going with one individual's point of view. </p><p>   Mr. Borenstein said he changed certain facts, like bringing to life a key character's deceased mother, played by Sally Field, to drive home her formative impact. HBO ran disclaimers noting that this was a dramatization. </p><p>   HBO defended the show's \"extensive factual research and reliable sourcing\" and affirmed its support for the series. </p><p>   From the first moments of both Magic Johnsonseries, the drama's harder-hitting approach is clear. </p><p>   \"Winning Time,\" starring newcomer Quincy Isaiah as Mr. Johnson, starts with a short scene in a doctor's office where Mr. Johnson presumably has just learned of his diagnosis with HIV. An associate sobs. Mr. Johnson sits stunned. A mythic character has been brought crashing down to Earth. </p><p>   By contrast, \"They Call Me Magic\" opens with praise from famous fans like NBA great Michael Jordan and former President Barack Obama. As it unfolds, the series presents a more polite version of Mr. Johnson's relationships on and off the court, and it dwells on his business success and good works in underserved communities. </p><p></p>",
