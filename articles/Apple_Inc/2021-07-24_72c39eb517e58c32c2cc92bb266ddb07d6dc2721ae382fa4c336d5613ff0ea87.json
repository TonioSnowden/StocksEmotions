  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Style & Fashion: It's Really Not a Big Deal --- How the Insta-famous tiny bag went from absurd viral joke to a liberating everyday essential",
  "text": "<p>After a mostly handbag-free lockdown, women are rethinking their overstuffed carryalls, those bottomless, 13-plus-inch bags they used to lug to work. Such a bag could easily house a laptop, a wallet, a cosmetics case bursting with superfluous makeup, a S'well bottle, that novel they've been meaning to start, some ballet flats, workout clothes, and the double-chocolate cookie from Pret a Manger that they were so looking forward to eating but can't because it's eternally buried somewhere between the novel and the cosmetics case. Now, as the U.S. reopens, some women want to move beyond the pack-mule-like existence those bags perpetuate. So they're trading jumbo totes for the once-mocked mini bag.</p><p>Christina Sanchez, a Los Angeles corporate visual merchandiser and recent tiny-bag convert, said micro styles have helped her maintain a more minimal lifestyle -- or at least schlep around less stuff. \"It's like I'm free,\" said Ms. Sanchez, 32. Since returning to the office in December, she's relied on a trio of minis, one as small as her hand. With a hint of disbelief, she recalled that most days pre-lockdown, she'd haul around at least a pound of unnecessary accouterments. Now, she's whittled her daily cargo down to the bare essentials: \"My [credit] card, my ID, maybe some cash, and my vaccine card.\" And while not all her miniatures can accommodate her phone on top of that, she'd rather stick it in her pocket than revisit a bulkier bag.</p><p>Ms. Vidal, the influencer, shares that view. \"My phone is always in my pocket or my hand. . .I don't remember the last time I had it in my bag,\" she said. She also appreciates that, \"after years of carrying so much stuff for everybody,\" the minis dissuade her husband and four children from burdening her with their inconvenient effects. \"It's life-changing.\"</p><p>Over the past year, Harriet Hawksworth, the editor in chief of online retailer Farfetch, has seen interest in tiny bags rise. \"We thought it was a bit of a fad,\" she said. \"But it's really continued to grow.\" To meet demand, brands, luxe or not, have added bitty bags to their selections. Zara sells a hardware-embellished one for $50; starting in September, Hermes will offer a 3.4-by-3.4-inch Kelly bag for $3,635 (above); and last month, Christian Dior introduced micro versions of its most recognizable bags, including the 4.7-by-3.9-inch iteration of the Lady Dior (above). While Ms. Hawksworth predicts women will use a mix of handbag sizes once they return to the office, the micro bag \"is not going anywhere.\"</p><p>A combination of factors has fueled the teeny bag surge. For starters, \"a lot of people are more conscious about what they touch right now,\" said Saisangeeth Daswani, who analyzes fashion and beauty at London trends-intelligence company Stylus. She means germs. Mini bags have less contamination-prone surface area, and most come with cross-body straps, negating the need to fling them on grimy subway benches or atop sticky bars. The pandemic-era popularity of Marie Kondo-ish downsizing also played a role. \"People are being much more mindful about their consumption and how much stuff they actually need around them,\" said Ms. Daswani. Our increasingly digital existence is relevant, too. \"There's Apple Pay and credit cards. In most cities, that's all you need,\" said Jesse Dorsey, the Milan-based co-founder and creative director of Boyy, an accessories brand that offers an array of buckle-embellished minis.</p><p>Still, the mini-bag obsession surprises Mr. Dorsey. \"As much as I love them, I'm like, 'Who's going to buy these?' But it seems you just can't get small enough.\" Social media, he said, has only whetted the appetite. \"They have so much visual punch. . .[They] almost look animated,\" which makes them prime Instagram fodder. Last week, the rapper Lizzo posted a photo that shows her wielding a silver Fendi Nano Baguette. It has over 323,000 likes.</p><p>The novelty aspect is what drove Katie Garnish, a Harpenden, U.K.-based freelance writer, to buy an 3-inch-long, lemon-yellow bag last month. While she'd grown tired of her unwieldy satchel -- in which she'd cram her laptop, sunglasses, lunch, \"a whole pharmacy\" and \"other junk\" -- what sold her on the tiny bag was its \"hilarious\" dinkiness. \"I think it makes people look really stupid,\" said Ms. Garnish, 25. \"I [wanted] to look ridiculous.\" Disorientingly, she found it practical. At least once a week, it transports her keys and mask, often to the pub. It's also lifted her spirits. \"I've been sad for the last 18 months so I bought myself a tiny handbag,\" she said. \"It's a fashionable thing that's really playful and everyone can join in and find it funny. Does that not just make you happy?\" At least as happy as a double-chocolate cookie.</p>",
