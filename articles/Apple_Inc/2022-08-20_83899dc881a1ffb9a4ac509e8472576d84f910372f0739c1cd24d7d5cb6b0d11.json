  "title": "Who's the 'Queen of Christmas'? Singer Tries to Block Mariah Carey's Trademark Application; Elizabeth Chan, who has written and performed original Christmas songs for a decade, believes Christmas is big enough for more than one 'Queen'",
  "text": "<p>\"Christmas is big enough for more than one 'Queen,' \" Ms. Chan said in a filing to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Aug. 11.</p><p>Ms. Chan started making Christmas music in 2012 after quitting a publishing job, releasing 11 albums since then.</p><p>\"When I was bestowed the title of Queen of Christmas, it was really meaningful to me,\" Ms. Chan said in a phone interview, citing TV appearances and a New Yorker article published 4 years ago that gave her the moniker. \"Christmas is my full-time work. It's my life. It's my calling.\"</p><p>Ms. Carey has been called the Queen of Christmas, too. The pop superstar's 1994 song \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" has become a modern-day juggernaut, climbing the charts every holiday season.</p><p>In recent years, Ms. Carey has been hard to escape during the holidays. She filmed a Christmas special for Apple TV+ in 2020, published Christmas books and released remixes of other Christmas classics. Last year, fast-food chain McDonald's Inc. gave out free Big Macs and McNuggets in the 12 days before Christmas in a promotion called \"The Mariah Menu.\"</p><p>But Ms. Chan's filing points out that Ms. Carey has said in interviews that she didn't want the title. \"I just want to humbly say that I don't consider myself that,\" Ms. Carey is quoted in the filing as saying in a 2021 radio interview.</p><p>Ms. Carey's trademark application, filed on the singer's behalf by her lawyers, says otherwise: \"The name 'QUEEN OF CHRISTMAS' identifies Mariah Carey, a living individual whose consent is of record.\"</p><p>Representatives for Ms. Carey didn't respond to a request for comment. Neither did her lawyer.</p><p>Ms. Chan said she found out about Ms. Carey's trademark application late last year ahead of the release of an album called \"The Queen of Christmas.\" Ms. Chan was told by her entertainment lawyers. </p><p>Elizabeth Chan at her home in New York City.

Last month, the application was opened to opposition from those who wanted to claim the trademark.</p><p>Ms. Chan is the only person to oppose. But since her filing, another Queen of Christmas has spoken out.</p><p>\"David Letterman officially declared me the Queen of Christmas 29 years ago,\" said singer Darlene Love, who performed her song \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\" on the TV host's show every holiday season.</p><p>\"At 81 years of age I'm NOT changing anything,\" Ms. Love said in a Facebook post. \"I've been in the business for 52 years, have earned it and can still hit those notes! If Mariah has a problem call David or my lawyer!!\"</p><p>Ms. Love's publicist didn't respond to a request to interview the singer.</p><p>Jessica Litman, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school, said these types of trademark disputes are typically resolved in two ways. Lawyers for Ms. Carey and Ms. Chan can reach an agreement and decide who can stamp the phrase on which products. Or they can go through a trial, which often takes as long as 18 months, and have a panel with three judges decide.</p><p>If Ms. Carey wins the trademark, she could sue anyone who uses Queen of Christmas on products she was awarded the trademark for, Ms. Litman said.</p><p>Ms. Carey's company has until Sept. 20 to respond to Ms. Chan's opposition, though it could ask the court for an extension.</p><p>Ms. Chan is also opposing two other trademarks Ms. Carey's company has applied for: \"QOC,\" the acronym for Queen of Christmas, and \"Princess Christmas.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Should the \"Queen of Christmas\" be a shared title? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"That's what I call my daughter,\" said Ms. Chan, whose 5-year-old, Noelle, sings in her mom's song \"Christmas Holiday.\"</p><p>Ms. Chan said she doesn't want the trademarks for herself. She doesn't think anyone should have them.</p><p>\"No one should own Christmas,\" she said. \"Christmas is for everybody.\" </p><p>Christmas d√©cor at Ms. Chan's home in New York City.
