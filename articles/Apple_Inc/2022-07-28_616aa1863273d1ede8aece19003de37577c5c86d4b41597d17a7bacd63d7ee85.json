  "title": "World News: Wuhan Locks Down District After Four Asymptomatic Covid-19 Cases",
  "text": "<p>It is the first time that Wuhan has imposed a restriction since late January 2020, when the city had the world's first coronavirus lockdown, which lasted for 76 days. Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited the city and said the country would rather sacrifice some of its economic development to remain Covid zero.</p><p>The central government has taken a stringent approach to fight the virus, locking down buildings, districts or whole cities for days or weeks over a single-digit number of Covid cases.</p><p>Most recently, the Shenzhen government ordered that city's biggest companies, including telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. and electric car maker BYD Co., to tighten controls over employees' movements and test workers daily for Covid-19 as it tries to eradicate a persistent outbreak in the southern Chinese technology and manufacturing hub.</p><p>A notice viewed by The Wall Street Journal ordered the top 100 enterprises in Shenzhen to close factory areas and undertake a series of new virus-control measures for seven days beginning this past Sunday. The order from the city's Bureau of Industry and Information Technology said the companies affected also included iPhone assembler Foxconn and drone maker SZ DJI Technology Co.</p><p>Among the new measures announced in the notice was a \"closed-loop\" system designed to limit the movement of non-essential personnel. The notice also called for once-a-day testing for all employees, with some workers asked to work from home. However, as of Tuesday evening there was little evidence that the order was having a major impact on company operations.</p><p>The sprawling southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, is home to some of China's biggest technology companies, as well as being a major hub for hardware and manufacturing. Representatives at most of the companies named in the notice either declined to comment or didn't respond to a request to comment. Foxconn's operations remained normal, a spokesperson said.</p><p>Shenzhen, which contributes about 2.7% of China's total gross domestic product and is home to the world's fourth-biggest port, won plaudits for quickly bringing an earlier outbreak under control in March, without the kind of economic damage seen from Shanghai's two-month lockdown that began days later.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
