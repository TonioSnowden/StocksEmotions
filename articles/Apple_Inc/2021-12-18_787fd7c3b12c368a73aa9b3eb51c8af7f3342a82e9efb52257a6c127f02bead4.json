  "text": "<p>Ditto Kamala Harris. When she denounced the alleged episode as an \"attempted modern day lynching\" of \"one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know,\" she and her advisers were calculating what would advance the career of Kamala Harris.</p><p>The same is true of other celebrities and pols who clambered aboard. They were thinking of their own nobility as they pushed each other out of the way to endorse Mr. Smollett's victimhood. It wasn't a failure of skepticism on their part. It wasn't a failure of due diligence. They did their due diligence, all right, and concluded there was only immediate upside to be seen standing with a gay black man making an accusation.</p><p>In the days stretching out before him now after being convicted last week, Mr. Smollett faces a fate his enablers won't share. He's about to become the O.J. Simpson of racial hoaxers.</p><p>If he had done his own due diligence, he would have seen this day coming. Such hoaxes tend quickly to be exposed. It was onward and upward for Al Sharpton, not for Tawana Brawley. And she had excuses. She was a teenager in 1987 when she claimed she had been sexually assaulted by four white men. Her motive wasn't self-aggrandizing but a desire to avoid harsh parental punishment for staying out late with friends.</p><p>Mr. Smollett has no excuse. His motive was itself a hate crime, aimed at defaming a large class of Americans (i.e., Trump supporters) in order to raise his own fame and status. Even so, notice how many enablers were willing to be dragooned, after it was exposed, into trying to protect his lie, not for his benefit, for their own. It took a Cook County judge intervening to stop Chicago's Democratic machine from freeing Mr. Smollett on terms that would let him and his lawyers go on shouting that he had been framed by racist Chicago police.</p><p>Jussie will now pay the price. His facilitators won't pay any. Their investment in his lie turns out to be the \"heads I win, tails you lose\" variety.</p><p>Many will rightly say Mr. Smollett is getting what he deserves, but think about it this way: Had his story met the wall of skepticism it merited, he might have woken up to his situation he created for himself. He might have quickly come clean, put the blame on drugs, childhood trauma or some misguided plan to promote racial healing -- anything that allowed him to stop digging the reputational grave that is likely now to swallow the remaining decades of his life.</p><p>But then he had a lot of help in making this mistake from people who will be moving on without being the least discomfited by the consequences.</p><p>I headlined an earlier column \"Jussie Smollett Tests America's Taste for Lies.\" We have a lying problem in this country. Mr. Trump's flagrant lying, including about the 2020 election, represents, in the minds of many supporters, fighting his enemies with their own methods. You don't have to look deep to see that Mr. Biden, by conventional standards, is also racking up a record as an especially mendacious president, and not for any purpose of state. Kyle Rittenhouse was a white supremacist. Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation. Mr. Biden lied when he said no American had been vaccinated against Covid until he became president. He lied about what his advisers said about Afghanistan.</p><p>This is not Eisenhower-style lying about the U-2 program, vital to American security. This is lying to get through the day.</p><p>In a different world, at least some in the media would also see a connection between so much facile fibbing and the conspicuous behavior of his family, distinguished in the annals of political buck-raking for their apparent unwillingness ever to do real work while insisting on getting paid for use of the Biden name.</p><p>Maybe the decline in a sense of honor among our leadership class is an illusion from overestimating the past. Our media pretends rigor in relentlessly cataloging the lies of at least one politician, Mr. Trump. Otherwise, our reporters see their job as simply putting shoulder to whatever bandwagon comes along. Far from their minds is the question, \"Is it true?\" Not far from their minds are the questions, \"How can I work this?\" and \"What's in it for me?\"</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Notice That the Emperor Has No MAGA Hat?\" -- WSJ Dec. 29, 2021)</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
