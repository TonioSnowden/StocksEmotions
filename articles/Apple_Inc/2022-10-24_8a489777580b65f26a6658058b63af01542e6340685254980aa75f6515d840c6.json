  "text": "<p>Apple One, which bundles Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other services, will now cost $2 more a month at $16.95. Apple One's family plan, which allows account sharing, will rise to $22.95 a month from $19.95.</p><p>The iPhone maker's streaming business is part of its plan to grow its services business, which brought in nearly a quarter of all its sales in its fiscal third-quarter. Apple is scheduled to release its latest quarterly results on Thursday.</p><p>The company said Apple Music's price increase is due to the rising cost of licensing music. It said the new price for Apple TV+ reflects the bigger selection of shows and movies it currently has compared with when it launched three years ago.</p><p>\"CODA,\" a movie Apple TV+ released last year, won the best picture Oscar in Marchâ€”the first such win for a streaming service. Last month, its show \"Ted Lasso\" won the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series.</p><p>Other companies have been raising subscription fees amid rising costs for making new shows. Streaming site Netflix Inc. increased its prices earlier this year for the first time since 2020.</p><p>And Amazon.com Inc., citing rising shipping and labor costs, raised the price of its Prime membership, which includes free shipping, streaming services and other perks.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple One Now Cost More</p>",
