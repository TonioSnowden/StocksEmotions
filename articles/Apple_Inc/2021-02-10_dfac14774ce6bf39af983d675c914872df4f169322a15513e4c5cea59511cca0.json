  "text": "<p>US stocks ended the day marginally lower, as investors spent the day parsing weak consumer price data out of Washington. </p> <p>The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 ended the day less than 0.1 per cent lower while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.3 per cent. Roughly two-thirds of the companies within the S&amp;P 500 rose, but declines by Tesla, Apple and Amazon weighed on the index. The small-cap Russell 2000 sunk 0.7 per cent.</p> <p>Abrupt moves on Wednesday sent traders looking for clues for the selling pressure. Market measures of volatility rose, with the Cboe's Vix index rising just under half a point to 22. </p> <p>Data out of Washington earlier in the trading day showed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51185dec-24e1-3299-ba80-7c3d2c612bdc#post-60564\">core consumer prices were flat</a> for a second consecutive month, as unemployment and social curbs continued to take a toll. Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to have risen 0.2 per cent. </p> <p>While the data reminded bullish investors that an economic recovery remains in its infancy, it brought positive news for those concerned about quickly rising inflation, said Deepak Puri, chief investment officer for the Americas at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. </p> <p>“This is very much a step-by-step grinding up of inflation, which the market is much better able to account for,” Puri noted. </p> <p>The inflation data were released as debate in Congress over US President Joe Biden's $1.9tn stimulus package continued. The size of the spending programme has prompted Wall Street analysts to lift their forecasts for US economic growth. </p> <p>Prospects for a strong economic rebound later in the year have also unsettled investors, stoking fears that the Federal Reserve will dial back its $120bn-plus of monthly asset purchases that have supported financial markets throughout the pandemic. </p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ed63e7f-5389-42e8-beed-15b5d450c589\">Jay Powell speaking</a> at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday afternoon, stressed the importance of “patiently accommodative” monetary policy to boost the pandemic-ridden US labour market. </p> <p>The Fed chairman has set a high bar for tightening monetary policy, although some economists believe the US central bank will soon move to incorporate the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e34c273-6269-474a-b68c-e5fec33e6f28\">effects of a huge fiscal stimulus</a> in its forecasts. </p> <p>Wednesday's inflation data provided some support for US government bonds, which had sold off steadily in recent weeks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, fell 0.03 percentage points to 1.12 per cent. </p> <p>The FTSE All-World index clinched a new all-time high following a strong overnight session in Asia. China's CSI 300 rose 2.1 per cent, taking its gain for the week to almost 6 per cent — which, if sustained, would be the benchmark's best week since July last year.</p> <p>European markets plotted a marginal retreat. The Stoxx 600 benchmark ended the day 0.2 per cent lower. The UK's FTSE 100 index closed down 0.1 per cent. </p> <p>The dollar, as measured against a basket of currencies, was flat while gold rose 0.2 per cent, to $1,843 a troy ounce. </p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, settled 0.6 per cent higher at $61.47 a barrel, near its highest level since the first weeks of the pandemic. </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Aziza Kasumov in New York 2021 'Wall Street closes lower after tame US inflation data' FT.com 10 February.
