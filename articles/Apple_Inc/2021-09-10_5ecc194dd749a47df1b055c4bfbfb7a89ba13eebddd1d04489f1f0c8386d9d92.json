  "title": "Apple's Walled Garden Springs a Leak; Game stocks rally after Epic ruling costs Apple control of in-app payments in mixed verdict",
  "text": "<p>In short, both sides won something and lost something. Epic has to pay Apple damages from breaching its contract when it elected to put a link to its own payment system inside the iOS version of its \"Fortnite\" game, and the videogame maker backed by Chinese game titan Tencent fell well short of its goal to break Apple's hold on app distribution to its devices. \"We will fight on,\" Epic founder and chief executive Tim Sweeney tweeted Friday in response to the ruling.</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, will no longer be able to count on being the sole payment option within apps on its devices. Per the ruling, Apple can no longer bar developers from including buttons to other payment options in their iOS apps. Commissions on in-app purchases are a major source of high-margin revenue for Apple; analysts project App Store revenue will rise 23% to $21.6 billion for Apple's fiscal year ending later this month, according to consensus estimates on Visible Alpha. Apple's share price fell nearly 3% Friday.</p><p>The ruling is far from the final word on the matter. Lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe are looking closely at Apple and its big tech peers, and may ultimately decide on even more stringent changes. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who is pushing a bill that would break Apple's distribution hold, said Friday that \"much more needs to be done.\" Apple also seems likely to appeal, though it hasn't said yet if it will do so. Services like the App Store play a major role in the company's effort to diversify from the highly cyclical hardware business. That has also been a major draw for investors, who have propelled the company to a market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion.</p><p>But assuming the ruling sticks, Apple will need to work harder to keep App Store revenue flowing. That will require appealing directly to game developers and their power players; Judge Gonzalez Rogers noted that gaming apps account for about 70% of all App Store revenue, with less than 10% of App Store consumers driving that portion. Shares of mobile-game makers Zynga, Playtika and Roblox jumped Friday on the presumption that they will have to pay much less to Apple in the future. Apple will need to sell those developers harder on the virtues of its payment system, or find other ways to keep its users clicking.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Apple's Walled Garden Springs a Leak</p>",
