  "text": "<p>As Josiah Wedgwood's new creamware designs became the must-have dinner service of Georgian England, the Staffordshire potter reflected on its surging popularity. “It is really amazing how rapidly the use of it has spread almost over the whole globe,” he boasted to his business partner, Thomas Bentley. Already, it was held “in much higher estimation than the finest porcelain”. Then he pondered: “Don't you think we shall have some Chinese missionaries come here soon to learn the art of making Creamcolour?” Later, Wedgwood wrote bullishly of his desire to “make an inroad into China” and overtake the world's greatest ceramics exporter.</p> <p>Such limitless confidence highlights all the attractive features of Wedgwood, “the father of English potters”, who during the latter half of the 18th century converted, as his epitaph has it, “a rude and inconsiderable manufacture into an elegant art, and an important branch of national commerce”. He was a witty, skilful, learned and deeply generous entrepreneur who hoped to “astonish the world all at once, for I hate piddling you know”.</p> <p>But the correspondence also hints at why Wedgwood's contribution to British economic history and national identity matters now: his business marks the pivot point of the Great Divergence, when European and Atlantic wealth creation accelerated past the economies of Mughal India and Qing China. </p> <p>Colonialism, consumption and new energy sources kindled the fires of the Industrial Revolution and the shift of global power from east to west. All of which can be charted through the creamware, jasper and basalt pottery that emerged from his kilns in Stoke-on-Trent. </p> <p>Yet, 250 years on, the same city — with so many other Midlands towns — is wrestling with the rip-tide of globalisation and the industries that first forged these communities (ceramics, coal, steel, glass, textiles) are facing painful social dislocation wrought by this trade recalibration. As Stoke, Wolverhampton, Dudley and other “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f1c6213-543e-4adb-a641-808ecbc88875\">red wall</a>” conurbations try to chart a new path, Wedgwood's combination of business acumen and global mindset might offer some answers.</p>  <p><strong>Born in 1730 in Burslem</strong>, the “mother town” of the potteries, Wedgwood grew up in a pre-industrial world of cottage outwork, family enterprise, semi-rural smallholdings, and the birth pangs of the new nation of Great Britain. Destined to continue the family's trudging lineage of unexceptional pottery, he had a childhood disability (his leg had been chronically weakened through smallpox and would later be amputated) that meant he could not work a treadle wheel and be a thrower. </p> <p>Instead, he invested his innate genius in experimentation and an unceasing array of new glazes, colours, designs, shapes and sizes soon filled Wedgwood's pattern books. The Liberal prime minister William Gladstone later suggested that, “that disease . . . was probably the occasion of his subsequent excellence” and the key to understanding Wedgwood's “inquiring, searching, meditative, fruitful mind”.</p> <p>His early designs were a riot of rococo, chinoiserie and ornamental bravado: teapots shaped like cauliflowers in deep green, pineapple tea caddies in startling yellows, and cups and saucers replete with Orientalist romance. Wedgwood's innovative coloured glazing techniques extended to the production of pickle-dishes, dessert services, sauce boats, plates and ceramic handles for cutlery. </p> <p>Georgian Britain's increasingly prosperous economy, with its thirst for tea, coffee and chocolate, had found a perfect supplier. As Wedgwood recalled of this promising era: “I saw the field was spacious and the soil so good as to promise an ample recompense to anyone who should labour diligently in its cultivation.”</p> <p>Whether he caused it or captured it, Wedgwood was the master salesman to Europe's first mass consumer society. “Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production,” wrote Adam Smith in his <em>Wealth of Nations</em> (1776), “and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer”.</p> <p>A combination of rising real incomes, an ethos of social emulation, and riches wrung from the colonial economy made England the epicentre of acquisitive accumulation. And thanks to Bernard Mandeville's <em>The Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits</em> (1714), luxury was no longer such a dirty word. Instead, fashion and the conspicuous consumption of Chippendale furniture or Wedgwood tableware was now championed for encouraging employment, sociability and self-improvement.</p> <p>In a noisy and discerning retail environment, the challenge for Wedgwood and Bentley was how to distinguish brand strength. The answer, as any Instagram influencer knows, was to capture the mood makers. “The progress of the arts, at all times, and in every country, depends chiefly upon the encouragement they receive from those, who by their rank and affluence are legislators in taste,” Wedgwood wrote.</p> <p>So when he perfected his creamware body — an affordable earthenware to which transfer designs could be applied easily — he sought the approval of the ultimate legislator in taste, Queen Charlotte. Creamware became Queensware — “a name has a wonderful effect,” he informed Bentley — and Wedgwood took out adverts styling himself “Potter to Her Majesty”. </p> <p>There is barely a technique in modern marketing — from product placement to advertising to free delivery to limited edition designs — that Wedgwood and Bentley did not anticipate. His West End showroom was more commercial gallery than shop: a space “to shew various table &amp; desert [sic] services completely set out on two ranges of tables . . . in order to do the needful with the Ladys [sic] in the neatest, genteelest &amp; best method”. </p> <p>When he completed his “Frog Service” dinner set for Empress Catherine II of Russia, he sold tickets for exclusive viewings. And when neoclassicism took over from rococo, Wedgwood seamlessly shifted his designs from baroque extravagance to austere elegance, with his jasperware vases becoming keenly desired ornaments for every stately home of note. Studiously, he never discounted because “low prices must beget a low quality in the manufacture, which will beget contempt, which will beget neglect, &amp; disuse, and there is an end of the trade.”</p>  <p><strong>Above all, the product was superb</strong>. Wedgwood was a virtuoso businessman who combined technical proficiency with a gifted eye for trends. His marriage of technology and design, retail precision and manufacturing efficiency means it is not too much of a stretch to regard him as the Steve Jobs of the 18th century. </p> <p>In the words of Walter Isaacson, the Apple pioneer's biographer, Jobs “knew that the best way to create value in the 21st century was to connect creativity with technology, so he built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering”. The same could be said of Wedgwood in his interdisciplinary thinking, aesthetic control, production oversight and relentlessly experimental frame of mind. </p> <p>Unlike Apple, he kept production local and manufactured his pottery at a markedly reduced cost by transforming ceramic production. The beginnings of the Industrial Revolution can be found in a modest Stoke-on-Trent potbank he named Etruria, in honour of the preclassical civilisation renowned for its ceramics. </p> <p>Whereas previously the making of ceramics — from mixing of the clay to throwing the pots to dipping in slip to firing in a kiln — had taken place at different sites, Wedgwood consolidated them into a single conveyor belt-style process. He established a clear-cut division of labour to “make such machines of the men as cannot err” and, to eliminate waste, initiated the earliest system of cost accountancy in British corporate history. </p> <p>Alongside Richard Arkwright's Cromford cotton mills in Derbyshire and Matthew Boulton's Birmingham Soho Manufactory for metal goods, Wedgwood's Etruria became a symbol of the coming industrial age of mass production. The Bloomsbury critic Roger Fry never quite forgave him. “As pottery, Wedgwood's work is beyond praise, though it probably finally contributed to the destruction of the art, as an art,” he wrote, a little unfairly, “since it set an example of mechanical perfection which to this day prevents the trade from accepting any work in which the natural beauties of the material are not carefully obliterated by mechanical means.”</p> <p>As with many a successful entrepreneur, Wedgwood combined a ruthless business model with progressive politics. His was a radical patriotism, which combined a deep love of country alongside a fearful sense that the meaning of England — liberty under the law, Protestantism and progress — was being undermined by ministerial greed and incompetence. He was a democrat who supported the parliamentary reformer John Wilkes with a series of teapots championing “Wilkes and Liberty” as the calling cry of a free Britain. </p> <p>Wedgwood also shared Wilkes' sympathy for the revolutionary American colonists as fellow patriots seeking to protect their Magna Carta rights, and went so far as to design an intaglio depicting a coiled rattlesnake, bearing the Continental Army slogan “Don't Tread on Me”. </p> <p>As a reader of Thomas Paine, Wedgwood was equally excited by the storming of the Bastille. “I know you will rejoice with me in the glorious revolution which has taken place in France,” he wrote in July 1789 to his friend, the doctor and naturalist Erasmus Darwin. “The politicians tell me that as a manufacturer I shall be ruined if France has her liberty, but I am willing to take my chance in that respect.”</p> <p>Yet Wedgwood's most lasting contribution to 18th-century radicalism was his campaign against the slave trade, where he used his profound gifts of design and marketing to create a medallion that became the defining symbol of anti-slavery activism. Composed of white jasper with a black relief and mounted in gilt-metal, it depicts an enslaved African man on half-bended knee raising up his shackled arms. On the edge of the tiny medallion is inscribed the challenge: “Am I not a man and a brother?”</p> <p>Produced and distributed at Wedgwood's expense, it was known as the Emancipation Badge and still stands as one of the most noble displays of what, in today's sour expression, might be termed virtue signalling. “Of the ladies, several wore them in bracelets, and others had them fitted up in an ornamental manner as pins for their hair,” wrote the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson. “At length, the taste for wearing them became general; and thus fashion, which usually confines itself to worthless things, was seen for once in the honourable office of promoting the cause of justice, humanity, and freedom.”</p> <p>This combination of marketing, design, manufacturing efficiency, and global ambition fostered in Wedgwood his historic determination to see off China. “I shall be glad to give you joy on the conquest of Peking,” he had boasted to Bentley, when he first heard of his jasperware being exported to China.</p> <p>Since the early 1600s, when the Dutch introduced Chinese porcelain to Europe, it was the “white gold” sailing from Canton that dominated the ceramics market. Sending his pottery up the Trent and Mersey Canal, from Stoke to the Liverpool docks and then to Europe, the Americas and empire, Wedgwood sought to turn the tide — and the affordability and durability of his creamware, in contrast to the expense and fragility of porcelain, did just that. </p> <p>“The beauty, convenience, and variety of its forms, and its moderate price, have created a commerce . . . so universal that in travelling from Paris to St Petersburg, from Amsterdam to the furthest point of Sweden . . . one is served at every inn from English earthenware,” reported one French travel writer. </p>  <p><strong>Such was the pride in Wedgwood</strong> that when Earl Macartney embarked on the first official embassy to China in 1792, landing in Tianjin then travelling to Beijing, he carried with him a set of jasperware vases. China — the land that had fired exquisite ceramics for thousands of years, had invented porcelain and filled the cabinets of Europe with blue and white ware — was now to be reinstructed in the mystery of clay, by pottery from Staffordshire. </p> <p>The Qianlong Emperor was famously unimpressed, explaining that the Celestial Court had not “the slightest need of your country's manufactures”. But the looming reality was that British manufactures would trigger the rise of the west and the decline of Asian economies. </p> <p>Today, Tianjin stands as a symbol of the industrial might of modern Asia. For when China's&#xa0;export machine moved into&#xa0;gear in the 1990s, its&#xa0;effect on British&#xa0;ceramics, among many other&#xa0;markets around the world, was punishing. In 1984 there were 66 major potteries in Staffordshire employing 30,000 workers; by 2011, it had fallen to 33, employing some 8,000. For Wedgwood it was even worse, as the business simultaneously faced managerial missteps under the stewardship of the O'Reilly family.</p> <p>Confronting falling sales and explosive debt, Waterford Wedgwood (as it had become) outsourced the skilled work of Stoke painters, lithographers, glazers and dippers. The company bought Royal Doulton to acquire a new ceramic factory in Indonesia, which delivered low labour costs but at the cost of brand annihilation. “They did something . . . silly,” reflected Japanese-born ceramic artist Kaoru Parry, “when they moved their production to Indonesia. Because Japanese people loved Wedgwood, but they wouldn't buy it unless it was made in England.”</p> <p>The move didn't save them. Waterford Wedgwood went bankrupt in 2009 because of its sustained disavowal of Josiah Wedgwood's precepts for success. From cost control to product design to technology to brand equity, the inheritors of the Wedgwood legend killed value by upending the business ethos that had been established back in 1759. </p> <p>And in a tragic misreading of the past, the new managers thought the key to success was not to rival China, as Wedgwood had sought to do, but instead give in to a low-quality solution with its offshored production — even as it marketed the brand as classic, English tableware.</p> <p>In the hands now of the Finnish conglomerate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5403438c-f7e6-11e4-9beb-00144feab7de\">Fiskars</a>, the Wedgwood business based in Barlaston, Staffordshire, is finding its feet again. And at the Victoria and Albert Museum we are working with the business to open the Wedgwood Collection to more visitors and students. </p> <p>But what British industry — let alone the “Global Britain” of ministerial ambition — still sorely lacks is a modern Josiah. Since the death of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52ec0087-f1df-427d-9e0c-64ea64696549\">Terence Conran</a> and the unedifying decamping of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f9e86ca-a2cd-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1\">James Dyson</a> to Singapore, UK manufacturing and design has missed a figurehead with the brio and brilliance of Wedgwood. Someone who can unite art and industry, enterprise and aestheticism, and, above all, someone with the singular determination to alter the terms of trade between west and east and “astonish the world all at once”.</p> <p><em>Tristram Hunt is director of the V&amp;A and a former MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.
