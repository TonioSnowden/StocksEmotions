  "title": "'Louis Armstrong: Black & Blues' Review: Satchmo's Tangled Legacy; A documentary on Apple TV+ offers an insightful study of the singular musician's genius and his oft-stifled anger at America's race problem.",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>The trumpeter (and singer, lest anyone forget) died in 1971, and it's hard to imagine a more defining of a generational divide than an awareness of Louis Armstrong, aka Satchmo, aka Pops. He was ubiquitous from the '20s through the '60s (when he had a Top 40 hit with \"Hello, Dolly!\") and seems to have since gone off the pop radar. Only now, it seems, can he be seen in a proper light, which is precisely what Sacha Jenkins shines on the man in \"Louis Armstrong: Black &amp; Blues.\" The film may not take quite as many chances with the documentary form as Armstrong took with the opening cadenza of \"West End Blues\" (recorded by Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five in 1928) but it is a daring work, a worthy and affectionate statement about the most important single figure in American popular music, 20th Century Division.</p><p>Mr. Jenkins, whose earlier docs on rap and hip-hop have established him as a combination filmmaker and cultural critic, dispenses with the talking heads and keeps Armstrong—in various incarnations, through various ages— on screen for most of the time. The voices we hear behind the images include Armstrong's—Mr. Jenkins makes marvelous use of his subject's vast trove of reel-to-reel recordings, Armstrong having been a compulsive recorder of everything, even casual conversations. Which do not seem casual now in the least: He talks of his mother, his working as a boy in the brothels of New Orleans and his formative time at the Colored Waif's Home there, where he was sent for shooting off a gun in the street, and where he picked up the cornet. The musician's sometimes vulgarity-rich reflections on America's race problem will disabuse a viewer of the notion that Armstrong was, at heart, some shuffling jester immune to bigotry. He was, much of the time, profoundly ticked off.</p><p>But as an entertainer first and foremost, he hid his exasperation with his country, at least from the public; Mr. Jenkins includes an on-the-fly interview done during the Little Rock school-integration crisis of 1957 during which Armstrong could be described as cautiously outraged at Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus. He was also, in his way, staunchly patriotic: Asked why he so often played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" during his shows, he said. \"I feel that I'm somebody . . . I feel as proud as anyone who ever picked up a gun, soldiered a rifle and said, 'Forward march.'\" The critic Dan Morgenstern, a frequent voice in \"Black &amp; Blues,\" recalls James Baldwin hearing Armstrong play the anthem and saying, \"That's the first I've liked that song.\"</p><p>Mr. Jenkins does a good job of a difficult thing, establishing why Armstrong was a musical genius. (Artie Shaw, the big band era's leading intellectual, offers one of the more cogent explanations of both genius and Armstrong during one of the film's many audio interviews.) Also, why he lost favor during a period of civil-rights legislation and increasingly black activism. But just the breadth, sweep and diversity of voices in \"Louis Armstrong: Black &amp; Blues,\" living and dead, say much about the man's influence and the way he confounded even his admirers: early jazz innovator Jelly Roll Morton and free-jazz legend Archie Shepp; jazz critic Leonard Feather and TV host Mike Douglas; Leonard Bernstein and Bunk Johnson; Lucille Armstrong, Armstrong's beloved second wife, and Lil Hardin, his first, the pianist in the Hot Five and Hot Seven who got him to leave his mentor, trumpeter King Oliver. \"I told him,\" Hardin recalls, \"'I don't want to be married to the second trumpet player.'\" Say what you like, and Mr. Jenkins does: Armstrong was never second to anyone again.</p><p>Mr. Anderson is the Journal's TV critic.</p><p>'Louis Armstrong: Black &amp; Blues' Review: Satchmo's Tangled Legacy</p>",
