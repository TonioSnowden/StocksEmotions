  "text": "<p>Hello, this is Kenji from Hong Kong, where we are in the midst of the mid-year earnings season. The overall tone so far seems to be tilting toward the negative side, and the tech sector is no exception. While JD.com pleasantly surprised the market with its results, both Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding reported zero top line growth for the first time since their listings over a decade ago. Smartphone maker Xiaomi saw its net profit for the first half of the year dip 95 per cent, while component makers such as Sunny Optical and AAC saw their bottom lines cut by half or more.</p> <p>The weak results are a function of various factors, primarily Covid-19 lockdowns, rising input costs, a tight regulatory regime for the tech sector and heightened geopolitical tensions — all which have combined to decelerate the Chinese economy as a whole.</p> <p>And now, a new downward push is coming from the inland province of Sichuan, perhaps more familiar in its traditional spelling of “Szechwan,” from its connection with the local spicy cuisine. A severe power shortage in the area is forcing factories to shut down, snarling supply chains for everything from automobiles to Apple products. It is not clear how long the situation will drag on, but it has already brought another aspect of supply chain vulnerability to light.</p> <h2>Crunch time</h2> <p>The latest woe to hit China's supply chain comes from the sizzling sunshine in the southwestern landlocked province of Sichuan and its neighbour Chongqing.

China is in the throes of a regulatory crackdown on tech companies and diplomatic relations between Beijing and Tokyo are strained.</p> <h2>Wingtech takes flight</h2> <p>Wingtech Technology has been an Apple supplier for less than a year.

Apple's laptops are considered the most advanced consumer notebooks available, and their production has long been dominated by top Taiwanese contractors Quanta Computer and Foxconn. The Shanghai-listed challenger is now planning to hire at least 20,000 additional workers for its factory in Yunnan Province, the base from which it aims to capture more of the Apple and Samsung supply chain.</p> <h2>Robotic rumble</h2> <p>The race for hegemony in robotics is heating up as players from China, South Korea and Japan scramble for a slice of one of the most promising tech markets.</p> <p>At the World Robot Conference 2022 held in Beijing, Nikkei Asia's <strong>CK Tan</strong> got an up-close look at the 130 Chinese and foreign exhibitors showing off their latest wares, from drones to humanoid bots. Homegrown robot makers, he found, are increasingly eyeing the service and healthcare sectors as technology levels and labour costs both rise.</p> <p>These are precisely the areas that rivals are looking at. In South Korea, the use of robots in the logistics and restaurant industries is already expanding to cope with serious labour shortages and a rising minimum wage. Japanese player Medicaroid, meanwhile, is preparing to venture beyond its home market to sell its surgical robots elsewhere in Asia.</p> <h2>Suggested reads</h2> <ol>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffa21fd7-b8d9-4a15-be2b-cce21d12371d\">Chipmakers caught in crossfire of rising US-China geopolitical tensions</a> (FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/The-mystery-of-SoftBank-s-zero-tax-bill\">The mystery of SoftBank's zero tax bill</a> (Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Fujitsu-Riken-to-offer-1st-Japan-made-quantum-computer\">Fujitsu, Riken to offer 1st Japan-made quantum computer</a> (Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78e1e150-02ba-404d-b2a1-3780279ec4b1\">Hyundai is catching up with Tesla in the global EV race</a> (FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f305316-a254-4bd2-a10a-1d87282710ac\">Sony PlayStation faces UK class action lawsuit of up to £5bn</a> (FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Electric-cars-in-China/CATL-aims-for-battery-as-a-service-hegemony-in-China\">CATL aims for ‘battery as a service' hegemony in China </a>(Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/828f755d-5ce6-4da6-a369-852cc1f3ad1d\">TikTok's extraordinary rise signals a more multipolar internet</a> (FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/India-s-Ola-plans-massive-EV-push-but-obstacles-await\">India's Ola plans massive EV push but obstacles await </a>(Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5ccc093-1bf6-4503-a7f6-1729fbc04c99\">Tencent hurt by slowing Chinese economy and stalled game approvals</a> (FT)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Tighter-monetary-conditions-rein-in-Asian-unicorns\">Tighter monetary conditions rein in Asian unicorns</a> (Nikkei Asia)</p></li> </ol> <p><em>#techAsia is co-ordinated by Nikkei Asia's Katherine Creel in Tokyo, with assistance from the FT tech desk in London.</em></p> <p><em>Sign up </em><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/member/register/newsletter/?utm_campaign=GL_techAsia&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=NA_newsletter&amp;utm_content=article_link&amp;del_type=5&amp;pub_date=20220512160000&amp;seq_num=__SEQ__&amp;si=__MERGE__user_id__MERGE__\"><em>here</em></a><em> at Nikkei Asia to receive #techAsia each week.
