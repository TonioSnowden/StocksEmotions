For the first time, the central bank also signaled it would watch closely whether this rapid pace might eventually damage the economy with a \"lag.\"</p><p>By a unanimous vote, the Fed hiked its rate by 0.75 percentage points to a range of 3.75% to 4%.</p><p>See: Fed approves another jumbo interest-rate hike, adds dovish language on way forward</p><p>Movement in the expected trajectory of borrowing costs have been a major driver of stocks in 2022. In its battle to combat inflation running at 40-year highs, the Fed has raised interest rates from zero in February to a range of 3% to 3.25%, a tightening of liquidity that dragged the S&amp;P 500 index down 19.1% for the year to date.</p><p>\"With rates now well into restrictive territory, the Fed can afford to slow the pace of rate hikes, partly to assess what impact the near 400bp of cumulative tightening is having,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, in a note sent to clients after the Fed's annoucement.</p><p>\"Barring another upside inflation surprise in the October and November CPI reports, which we can't completely rule out, it looks like the Fed is laying the groundwork to shift down to a 50bp hike in December and, if we're right that core inflation will start to show signs of slowing soon, a 25bp rate hike at the January meeting next year.\"</p><p>See also: Live Markets Coverage</p><p>See: Here's how 'Fed Day' stock-market performance stacks up under Jerome Powell</p><p>In U.S. economic data reported earlier Wednesday payroll services firm ADP said the private sector added 239,000 jobsin October. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal earlier forecasted an increase of 195,000 jobs.</p><p>\"I think the ADP data was a bit more robust than folks thought,\" said Timothy Holland, chief investment officer at Orion Advisor Solutions. \"The market is really hoping that the Fed can credibly pivot to just a 50 basis point rate hike in December and then maybe even downshift from there in 2023,\" according to Holland.</p><p>\"You've seen some softness [in the economy], but you're not really seeing it in the labor market necessarily. And can the Fed credibly downshift if you're not getting softness on the jobs front? And that's the big question,\" Holland said.</p><p>Also helping support stocks was a well-received earnings report from chipmaker AMD AMD, delivered after Tuesday's closing bell. Companies reporting on Wednesday include Paramount Global PARAA, Zillow Z and eBay EBAY.</p><p>Meanwhile, in China, investors continued to bet on rumors that Beijing was considering relaxing its COVID-19 lockdown policy.
