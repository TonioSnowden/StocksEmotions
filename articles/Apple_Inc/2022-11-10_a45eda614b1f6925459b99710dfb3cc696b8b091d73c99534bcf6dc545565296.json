  "text": "<p>   PALM BEACH, Fla. -- High-profile candidates endorsed by Donald Trump struggled and his GOP rivals in Florida and Georgia had smashing victories in Tuesday's election, presenting a formidable challenge to the former president's assertion of dominance in the party and his bid to clear the field in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. </p><p>    Mr. Trump, like many Republicans, expected a \"red wave\" to carry the party to complete control of Congress. What came instead was far more measured. The GOP is favored to take the House, though with a smaller-than-anticipated margin. The Senate, where Mr. Trump staked much of his political capital, might stay in Democratic hands -- with losses by Trump-backed candidates possibly making the difference. </p><p>   That is likely to prompt questions about Mr. Trump's brand ahead of an expected Tuesday announcement of another presidential run. The weaker-than-expected GOP results also set off a wave of second-guessing of the party's approach in the campaign. </p><p>   \"As it turns out, candidates and campaigns matter,\" said Kevin McLaughlin, an ally of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. </p><p>   Mr. McConnell, the Senate's GOP leader, had aired concerns over some candidates earlier in the cycle, taking public a fight with Mr. Trump and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the head of the Republicans' Senate campaign arm. He felt their actions to shape the field were advancing Republican candidates who were too extreme or unappealing to win in a general election, potentially costing the party winnable Senate seats. </p><p>   Mr. Scott rejected Mr. McConnell's comments, and Mr. Trump has called to replace him as party leader. </p><p>   In a social-media message Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the results \"A GREAT EVENING\" and said Democrats and media outlets were \"doing everything possible to play it down.\" </p><p>   Some Republicans said Mr. Trump had undercut the GOP's chances. </p><p>   Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), who is retiring after this term, pointed to the poor showing by Trump-endorsed GOP candidate Doug Mastriano in the Pennsylvania governor race, which he said dragged down the state's other Republicans, including losing Senate candidate Mehmet Oz. \"All across the country we see that the hardcore MAGA candidates dramatically underperformed more conventional Republicans, so that's a big reality that we have to recognize,\" he said. </p><p>   The biggest winner of the night among prominent Republicans was a potential opponent to Mr. Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won a second four-year term by 19 percentage points and delivered a victory speech that underscored his political ambition isn't limited to Tallahassee. \"Two more years, two more years,\" his supporters chanted in Tampa. </p><p>   Mr. Trump made a number of controversial endorsements in Senate races and saw some pay off, such as in Ohio, where J.D. Vance won in a seat held by a retiring Republican, and North Carolina, where Trump-backed Republican Ted Budd prevailed. But his pick in Pennsylvania, Mr. Oz, lost and Blake Masters trailed in Arizona. In Georgia, Herschel Walker was headed for a December runoff in the state that could once again determine control of the chamber as it did in the 2020 election. </p><p>   The other Senate race that hangs in the balance is Nevada, where Republicans and polls had suggested a GOP pickup; that result might not be known for days. </p><p>   Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich blamed Mr. McConnell, accusing him of abandoning \"winnable races.\" </p><p>   Representatives for Mr. McConnell didn't respond to requests to comment. </p><p>   On his TruthSocial platform, Mr. Trump sought to shift blame to Republican candidates who didn't sufficiently embrace his unfounded claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Mr. Trump also exulted in the loss of Colorado Republican Senate candidate Joe O'Dea, who rejected the fraud claims. </p><p>   Some other prominent candidates who did embrace such election fraud claims struggled on Tuesday, including Wisconsin GOP gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels, who lost his bid, and Arizona Republican governor hopeful Kari Lake, who was locked in a tight race after being favored to win by some analysts. Rep. Lee Zeldin, who voted against certifying President Biden's 2020 victory, lost in the New York governor's race. </p><p>   On the flip side was the re-election victory of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Mr. Trump long assailed the Republican over his refusal to challenge the 2020 results in Georgia. </p><p>   \"Republicans are waking up to the fact that he is a net negative for their fortunes,\" Republican strategist Liam Donovan said of Mr. Trump. \"I don't think this affects his thinking. He is immovable in that sense. The choice for Republicans is, are we really going to go down this road again?\" </p><p>   Mr. DeSantis was already seen as a 2024 contender. A Florida exit poll conducted for CNN and other networks asked Florida voters whether they want Mr. Trump or Mr. DeSantis to run for president. While 33% picked the former president, 45% named the governor. </p><p>   \"Trump's allies losing is a setback, but his real problem is DeSantis' huge win,\" Republican consultant Alex Conant said. \"Trump has a formidable rival inside the GOP for the first time.\" </p><p>   Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal and other reporters traveling on his plane to Florida from Ohio on Monday that it would be a mistake for Mr. DeSantis, 44 years old, to challenge him. </p><p>   \"I think the base would not like it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't think I'd have any trouble defeating him. . . . If he did run, I will tell you things about him that won't be very flattering.\" </p><p>   Mr. DeSantis hasn't commented on those remarks. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Siobhan Hughes and Natalie Andrews contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
