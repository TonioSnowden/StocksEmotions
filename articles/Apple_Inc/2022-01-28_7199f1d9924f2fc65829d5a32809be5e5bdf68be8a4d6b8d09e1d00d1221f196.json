Wider supply constraints were also cited this morning as a reason for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63d24774-23d6-46ee-8ba3-c631b1a6e1f7#post-69cd42a3-e919-40e4-bbef-028ca3a972da\">Germany's economy shrinking</a> in the final quarter of last year. </p> <p>The chip shortage has been a recurrent theme in the current earnings season. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25450ffe-e080-4f7a-b8d5-94d23d52af77\">Apple</a>, which reported yesterday, is one of the few big companies that seems to have navigated around the problem, with iPad sales being the only key segment affected, although <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a2c18b9-4c37-470a-8c01-bec0a2310882\">supply chain problems</a> still cost the company more than $6bn in fourth-quarter revenues.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eecc277f-20d8-4d4a-b2e7-ffc964f456ac\">GE</a> on Tuesday said shortages of semiconductors were a key factor in falling revenues, the same day as a report from the US commerce department found that demand for chips from American manufacturers had surged 17 per cent between 2019 and 2021, leaving companies with just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71958118-8daa-47a7-b8a4-11608d6805f4\">five days' worth of supplies</a> instead of the pre-pandemic norm of 40.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29866bf3-5c8c-4c9f-9771-f0a5032f0f0e\">Tesla</a> on Wednesday warned of the effect of supply chain hold-ups on this year's results, even as it reported a record net profit of $2.3bn in the fourth quarter of last year. </p> <p>The chip crisis is also hitting the car industry across the Atlantic. New industry data this week showed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f553b7e1-a3b5-4bf3-8cc3-16736872fd3c\">UK car production</a> fell 6.7 per cent last year from 2020 to leave it a third lower than pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p>For companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d402d072-f19a-4f75-80c6-e6973c3137cd#post-451b3c8f-7f8a-4515-bbbe-22efdc2234da\">Samsung</a> however, times are good.
