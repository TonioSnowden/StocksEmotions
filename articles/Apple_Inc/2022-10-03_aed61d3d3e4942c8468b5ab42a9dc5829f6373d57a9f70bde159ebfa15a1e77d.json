  "text": "<p>With business in the Capitol done until after the election, GOP lawmakers are confident of a strong showing on Nov. 8, while Democrats are holding out hope of defying conventional wisdom, with the economy, law and order and former President Donald Trump's political influence and future on voters' minds. In interviews, lawmakers laid out plans to debate opponents, knock on doors and spend days driving the lengths of their districts.</p><p>\"A lot of times people haven't actually interacted with, heard from or talked to, especially, a sitting member of Congress,\" said Kansas Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, who plans to meet voters by going door to door in her district, which was redrawn to be more rural in the recent redistricting process.</p><p>Republicans are criticizing Democrats over higher prices in the past year on everything from gasoline to groceries, while trying to tie them to a jump in violent crime in recent years, after some progressives in the party called for defunding police departments during protests in 2020. Republicans say that Democrats' $1.9 trillion Covid-19 package last year overheated the economy and fueled inflation, and that the party hasn't addressed a surge in border crossings.</p><p>\"President Biden has failed on grocery prices, on energy prices, on crime, at the border, on the world stage, on basic accountability,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said on the Capitol steps Thursday.</p><p>History is also on the Republicans' side. In a president's first term, the opposing party typically picks up seats in the midterm elections.</p><p>House Republicans are campaigning on their Commitment to America, which promises to fight back on rising costs and hire more police officers. The Republican plan also pledges to \"protect the lives of unborn children,\" nodding to the fight over abortion in this election. A majority of House Republicans have signed on to a bill that would ban abortion nationwide at 15 weeks.</p><p>Democrats point to two recent special-election wins in Alaska and New York as a sign they have momentum, and have touted recent legislation intended to address climate change and healthcare costs, as well as a bill to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. and improve supply-chain woes. They have labeled Republicans as too extreme, have cast them as close to Mr. Trump and see the abortion debate working to their advantage.</p><p>\"It's a choice between Democrats who are putting people over politics and extreme MAGA Republicans,\" said Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), referring to Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. \"They are extreme when it comes to reproductive freedom. We believe in it.\"</p><p>Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier, who is defending a district in Washington state, said women \"are fired up about the gall of politicians to tell them what they can and cannot do with their bodies.\" Her opponent, Matt Larkin, said in a GOP primary debate that he favors banning abortions beginning in the first trimester.</p><p>The Supreme Court ended the federal right to abortion access earlier this year, leaving the matter to the states for now and prompting Republican and Democratic lawmakers to propose rival federal legislation.</p><p>In private, many Democrats concede that they are preparing to lose the majority. But they are talking up their chances.</p><p>\"You're gonna see a lot of our front liners hold seats that people thought they couldn't hold,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said on Thursday, predicting Democrats could keep a narrow majority.</p><p>David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report estimates that Republicans can pick up between 10 to 20 seats in November.</p><p>\"It's an unusual midterm because Biden is not the only focus of voters,\" Mr. Wasserman said, pointing to abortion and Mr. Trump as also being on voters' minds. Of the 30 seats that are rated tossups, Democrats are defending 21 and Republicans are defending nine.</p>",
