  "text": "<p>\n  ViacomCBS Inc. unveiled a new management team and operating structure for its Paramount Pictures movie and television production unit that Chief Executive Bob Bakish said would better position it for the streaming era. </p><p>\n  Among the changes expected as a result of the realignment is a greater push for Paramount to create content exclusively for its Paramount+ streaming service and other ViacomCBS networks and streaming platforms, people familiar with the company's thinking said. </p><p>\n  \"The moves we're making today will build on Paramount's strong momentum, ensuring it continues to engage audiences at scale while embracing viewers' evolving tastes and habits,\" Mr. Bakish said Monday. </p><p>\n  Paramount Pictures under the new structure will likely reduce by about half the number of theatrical releases it typically makes in a given year, said one of the people familiar with the company's thinking. Paramount Pictures had been targeting making at least a dozen theatrical releases annually, the person said. </p><p>\n  On the television side, Paramount Television Studios will put more focus on creating shows for its own sister services such as Paramount+ and its cable networks including the Paramount Network, the people familiar with the company said. </p><p>\n  That is a shift from its current strategy which has made it a prolific supplier to services such as Netflix and Apple TV+, an approach some Wall Street analysts have cheered. </p><p>\n  The moves ViacomCBS is making are similar to those undertaken over the past year or more by Walt Disney Co., Comcast's NBCUniversal and AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia. The entertainment conglomerates aren't only putting a greater emphasis on building out their streaming services but also on creating content for themselves rather than acquiring TV shows and movies from outside producers. </p><p>\n  Under the new structure, Nickelodeon chief Brian Robbins will now have oversight of Paramount's movie operations including films for Paramount+. He will continue to oversee Nickelodeon as well, the company said. </p><p>\n  Mr. Robbins succeeds Jim Gianopulos, a well-regarded film veteran who has headed the studio since 2017 and returned the unit to profitability with hits such as \"A Quiet Place.\" Mr. Bakish called him a \"towering figure in Hollywood.\" Mr. Gianopulos will stay at Paramount as a consultant through the end of the year. </p><p>\n  As part of the overhaul, Paramount Television Studios will now be overseen by David Nevins, who is also the chief executive of ViacomCBS's premium cable channel Showtime. </p><p>\n  The move is aimed at putting all of the scripted content operations under one umbrella </p><pre>\n </pre><p></p>",
