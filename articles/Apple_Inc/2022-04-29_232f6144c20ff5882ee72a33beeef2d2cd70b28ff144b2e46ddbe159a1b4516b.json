  "text": "<p>As the health crisis has reshaped the way people think about work and travel, companies are feeling their way to new, postpandemic norms. Some are deciding that having teams working together again in offices is the best way forward. Airbnb is backing a more open view of where people can work, adding fuel to a trend that could benefit its business if it leads to more people working from its rental properties.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Apple Inc. AAPL are urging workers to return to the office a few days a week. Twitter Inc. TWTR and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. FB are offering greater flexibility. But a myriad of tax and other rules have generally meant that employees have had to stick to working in countries where they have legal residency. Airbnb is trying to go further than most to help its employees choose their own new normal.</p><p>Under Airbnb's new policy, pay scales for all U.S. and Canadian employees will be standardized at the top-paying tier instead of using location-based tiers. The home-rental giant also announced that its more than 6,000 employees can work for up to three months in a year from 170 of the countries and regions the company operates in.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Travel is back, but airline and hotel workers are not.</p><p>Oil middlemen fueled Putin's war machine.
