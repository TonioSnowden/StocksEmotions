  "title": "Apple Warns of Covid Threat to Revenue  ---  Lockdowns in China  could cut sales by as  much as $8 billion in  current quarter  ----  By Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>   Apple Inc. cautioned Thursday that the resurgence of Covid-19 in China threatens to substantially hinder sales by as much as $8 billion in the current quarter -- a setback after seeing improvements during the first three months of the year. </p><p>   The guidance from the iPhone maker came shortly after the company posted one of the best quarters in its 46-year history. The whipsaw of news sent the company's stock on a roller-coaster ride in aftermarket trading -- first rising before falling more than 2%. </p><p>   Many investors had expected a blowout January-through-March quarter and were more attuned to any indications from Chief Executive Tim Cook about how he saw the future amid high inflation, pandemic lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine. </p><p>   \"I want to acknowledge the challenges we are seeing from supply-chain disruptions driven by both Covid and silicon shortages to the devastation from the war in Ukraine,\" Mr. Cook told investors. \"We are not immune to these challenges.\" </p><p>   The new pain points for the Cupertino, Calif., company come as areas around Shanghai, where Apple has many suppliers, face government lockdowns aimed at reducing a resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>   \"Supply constraints caused by Covid-related disruptions and industrywide silicon shortages are impacting our ability to meet customer demand for our products,\" Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said during a public conference call. </p><p>   Mr. Maestri said the constraints will hurt revenue by $4 billion to $8 billion in the three months through June. The lockdowns are also expected to damp demand in China. </p><p>   The challenges come after a blockbuster quarter. Revenue rose 9% to $97.3 billion, far exceeding analysts' expectations for $94 billion. Earnings per share rose to $1.52 from $1.40 a year earlier, beating estimates for $1.42 and setting a record for Apple's fiscal second quarter. </p><p>   The results reflect the company's ability to navigate supply-chain challenges during that period that have been roiling the tech and auto industries, allowing the company to sell more iPhones than Wall Street expected. \"The supply constraints were significantly lower than what we had experienced during the December quarter,\" Mr. Cook said in an interview. </p><p>   \"Covid is difficult to predict,\" Mr. Cook added during the conference call. He noted \"almost all of the affected final assembly factories have now restarted.\" </p><p>   Apple's outlook added to a turbulent afternoon as investors worried about the overall economy. Amazon.com Inc. shares dropped 9% after the e-commerce company posted its first quarterly loss since 2015 on slowing sales growth. </p><p>   Apple's results were in line with guidance in January, when the company predicted a record for the March period, though growing at a slower rate compared with the previous quarter -- which included the Christmas holiday -- when the company marked all-time revenue and profit highs thanks to the latest iPhones, Mac computers and iPad tablets. </p><p>   The $97 billion quarter ranks as Apple's third best in history by total revenue but one of its slowest for growth since the pandemic began more than two years ago. The company has seen double-digit year-over-year growth each quarter since the launch of the first iPhone with 5G capabilities in October 2020. </p><p>   Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Synovus Trust Co., which counts Apple among its largest holdings, called supply-chain concerns, Covid-19 and inflation \"the Street's biggest worries\" about the current quarter. Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi echoed that sentiment in a note this week, predicting solid quarterly results and asking: \"But then what?\" </p><p></p>",
