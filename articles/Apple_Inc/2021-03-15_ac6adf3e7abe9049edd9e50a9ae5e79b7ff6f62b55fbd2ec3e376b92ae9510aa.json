  "text": "<p>Every five years or so, Nobel laureate and Booker Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro publishes a new novel. It is always an event, not least because it is impossible to know where his imagination will take him next. Postwar Japan, an English country house, a boarding school dedicated to cloning — Ishiguro's previous books have seen them all — and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08BPJHNCG/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08BPJHNCG&amp;linkId=1b82969a54b3880bee85486b9d72d421\"><strong>Klara and the Sun</strong></a> (<em>Faber &amp; Faber</em>) is another journey into new territory.</p> <p>The Klara of the title is an “artificial friend”, a creation somewhere between companion, servant and toy that has been invented for lonely adolescents. And she is also the novel's narrator, which is a fascinatingly two-fold task: not only does Klara tell the story of her transition from robot showroom to life with her new owner, Josie, but she also describes everything that she encounters from a non-human perspective. As Klara navigates Josie and her mother's anxieties about the teenager's failing health, she is also piecing together more general clues as to how the world works, constantly processing information to make her, essentially, more capable of passing as a human.</p> <p>This is the novel's striking premise, and it requires us to suspend disbelief and entrust ourselves to a storyteller who is extraordinarily perceptive but denied much of the intuitive and acquired knowledge that comes with living a whole, human life. The audiobook's narrator, Sura Siu, consequently has much work to do, and she does it ably and affectingly. There's no hint of the robotic about her delivery, no sense that any AI creation will inevitably sound like a version of Siri or Alexa. </p> <p>Here, instead, is a natural-sounding, uninflected American accent — and yet, Siu manages to incorporate a subtle hesitancy as she relays Klara's wonder and confusion at human life, her fundamental misunderstandings and, crucially, her conception of duty and emotion. We are aware, as we listen, that Klara's ability to respond to the complex dynamics of Josie's life are at once genuine and fundamentally mediated. This is a story that proceeds by gradual revelation, and pacing is essential: Siu's talent at allowing us space to register what isn't said is impressive.</p> <p>For those keen on exploring Ishiguro's backlist, I've been enjoying <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B078GVZSJB/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B078GVZSJB&amp;linkId=d30e46d4925fcaabfc86670407761623\"><strong>The Unconsoled</strong></a> (<em>Faber &amp; Faber</em>, read by Simon Vance), the long, dreamlike narrative that takes us through three days of a concert pianist's life in a peculiar, unknown town. Because it's not entirely supposed to make sense — bizarre characters crop up with no explanation, roads lead to nowhere, conversations are baffling, as in a lurid dream — its episodic structure translates well into an immersive listening experience.</p> <p>Elsewhere in new fiction, Niven Govinden's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08VW7HKRY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08VW7HKRY&amp;linkId=48bc75eff213da9ac34e9e6ec76e0ea0\"><strong>Diary of a Film</strong> </a>(<em>WF Howes</em>) has a certain kinship with <em>The Unconsoled</em>: a film-maker arrives in a city and surrenders himself to the hectic business of introducing his new work to the world, complete with complications and derailments. Steve John Shepherd's voice will be familiar to many (he played Jo in TV drama <em>This Life</em>, and Michael Moon in <em>Eastenders</em>) and he brings a steely edge to this tale of artistic endeavour and of shifting personal dynamics. Because this is a novel of introspection — the narrator ponders his relationship to his lead actors, themselves embarking on a relationship with one another, and his life's work — its tone is one of intimacy and shared confidences that draws the listener ever further inwards.</p> <p>In non-fiction, two memoirs have stood out. Josie George's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08WRRMWQT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08WRRMWQT&amp;linkId=a2fc60dd27e8ed5acf7292665478948a\"><strong>A Still Life</strong> </a>(<em>Bloomsbury</em>), which she narrates herself, has an apparently narrow focus that broadens irresistibly. George has spent her life grappling with a complex condition that sees her nervous system thrown into uproar by the simplest things: walking, eating, changes in temperature. Now 36, her daily life is one of confinement, in which she must temper her activities with rest and recovery and in which her mobility is severely compromised. But, as she explains to us in clear, measured tones, her life is one of richness, not impoverishment; a life of building on tiny moments of pleasure and enlightenment, of learning the value of simply noticing and observing. To hear her speak of it directly is immensely soothing, and it stands as a profound redefinition of the very idea of vitality.</p> <p>Finally, Nikesh Shukla's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086K4Q13Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B086K4Q13Q&amp;linkId=cef9a2f33ee0e97bda9c30e21d97ab54\"><strong>Brown Baby</strong></a> (<em>Bluebird</em>) is a moving account of the loss of the author's adored mother, a resonant exploration of becoming a parent to two daughters and an unflinching examination of the realities of race in contemporary Britain. Shukla conceived and edited the groundbreaking anthology <em>The Good Immigrant</em>, whose impact on the publishing of writers of colour cannot be underestimated; and this new book also contains excerpts from his podcast, with guests including Nadiya Hussein and Kit de Waal. Narrated by Himesh Patel (another <em>Eastenders</em> alumnus and, of course, the star of the 2019 film <em>Yesterday</em>) it is an inevitably angry book but also one of great tenderness and feeling. Like George's, it is also a book founded on hope — an increasingly precious commodity.</p> <p><em>Kazuo Ishiguro and molecular biologist and ‘Gene Machine' author Venki Ramakrishnan will discuss artificial intelligence, science and literature in Imagining a New Humanity at the FT Weekend Digital Festival, March 18-20.
