  "text": "<p>Apple's filing Thursday comes weeks after Epic gave its own reasons for its appeal in the case that mostly swung in Apple's favor. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had previously ruled against nine of Epic's 10 claims. A hearing before the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected later this year with a decision unlikely for several months afterward.</p><p>Apple said the earliest it expects a decision is the summer of 2023. Meanwhile, it has already won a reprieve from the appeals court in rolling out changes to the App Store ordered by Judge Gonzalez Rogers.</p><p>Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com</p><p>Apple Files Arguments With Appeals Court in Battle With Epic Games' Antitrust Claims</p>",
