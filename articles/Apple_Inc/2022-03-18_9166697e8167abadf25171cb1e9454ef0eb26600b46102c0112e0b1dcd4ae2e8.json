  "title": "China's Next Contagion? Beijing's zero-Covid strategy threatens the global economy.",
  "text": "<p>Western vaccines such as those produced by Pfizer and Moderna proved reasonably successful at protecting those who caught Omicron from severe symptoms, but Chinese-made vaccines are less effective. Thanks to two years of draconian zero-Covid policies, a smaller proportion of the population may have immunity from prior infection.</p><p>In response, Beijing is doing what it does best: lockdowns. Jilin's 24 million residents have been shut in, as have people in the southern exporting powerhouse of Shenzhen and parts of Shanghai, among others.</p><p>The result is another worry for a global economy that has started to right itself after two years of pandemic disruption. A range of exporters have seen work halted in their factories, including Foxconn (Apple's supplier) and Toyota. Logjams are developing at Chinese ports, which will have knock-on effects for global shipping.</p><p>China's domestic growth will take a hit. The Communist Party regime recently announced a GDP growth target of 5.5% for the year, but that will be impossible to achieve if major commercial centers are locked down. Another risk is consumer confidence, which already was under threat from the property-market slowdown President Xi Jinping has orchestrated over the past year. Beijing claims it's pursuing a \"shared prosperity\" agenda in which ordinary households will earn—and then spend—a greater share of the country's income. But first they need to be let out of their apartments.</p><p>Mr. Xi appears to be waking to the economic and political dangers. He instructed officials on Thursday to reduce the cost households bear for Covid controls. Vice Premier Liu He this week promised measures \"that are favorable to the market\" to stabilize equity prices roiled by Covid fears and worries that Beijing's long-running regulatory crackdown on tech companies could stifle growth.</p><p>Even as the lockdowns become more contentious with the public, Beijing shows little sign of abandoning its zero-Covid fixation. That policy stubbornness, combined with Beijing's apparent failure to devise an alternative in the two years since the pandemic began, is a danger to the health of Chinese citizens and the prosperity of China and the rest of the world.</p><p>China's Next Contagion?</p>",
