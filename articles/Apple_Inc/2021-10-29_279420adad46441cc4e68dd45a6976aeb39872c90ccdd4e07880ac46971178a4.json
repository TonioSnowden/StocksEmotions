  "text": "<p>Few words strike more fear into investors' hearts, and for good reason. By eating away at the purchasing power of your assets, inflation is the nemesis of every investor.</p><p>Everywhere you turn nowadays, someone is peddling protection: Gold! Bitcoin! Value stocks! Energy stocks! Commodities!</p><p>And no wonder: After years of quiescence, inflation has surged, hitting 5.4% year-over-year in September. With interest rates near zero and governments spending trillions, more of the same seems as unavoidable as nightfall.</p><p>Before you overhaul your portfolio, however, you should bear these basic truths in mind: Fear is a good investing philosophy only for the people who sell it. The more Wall Street agrees that a forecast is inevitable, the more likely the future is to repudiate it. And you're probably already better protected against a decline in purchasing power than you might realize.</p><p>Analysts, economists and other forecasters are no better at predicting inflation than at predicting anything else: They stink at it. As then-chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan noted in 1999, estimates of future inflation—including those by the Fed itself—\"have been generally off,\" and even changes in inflation that were \"doggedly forecast\" never occurred.</p><p>The fallibility of forecasts is one reason to think twice about overhauling your portfolio. The other is that the assets often peddled as inflation panaceas don't have magical powers.</p><p>Gold, for instance, has sometimes failed to keep up with rises in the cost of living for decades on end. (It's down almost 5% this year even as inflation worries have spread.)</p><p>Because the quantity of bitcoin is limited to 21 million, the digital currency has insulated its holders from inflation so far. Yet its price is so explosively volatile that it could plunge just when you most need stability, making it an erratic hedge.</p><p>Many asset managers promote value stocks, which trade at low prices relative to their assets or earnings, as inflation fighters.</p><p>Such companies can own assets like factories, equipment and real estate whose value should grow as prices rise. They operate in sectors such as energy, financials and utilities that often can raise prices to keep pace with inflation or interest rates.</p><p>By contrast, growth stocks—whose earnings investors expect to increase rapidly in the future—are more dependent on what happens years down the road.</p><p>That makes value stocks less reliant on tomorrow's earnings than growth stocks are. The further off profits are in the future, the more inflation chews away at their present value—implying that growth stocks will be hurt.</p><p>In periods of rising consumer prices, value stocks have done better than growth—but not always. Value shone in the inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1970s, 1980s and 2000s. Yet value underperformed growth stocks in the 1990s, even though the cost of living rose slightly faster in that decade than in the 2000s.</p><p>The difference is driven largely by technology companies, which have long dominated indexes of growth stocks.</p><p>Companies trading at sky-high prices relative to their earnings, as the so-called Nifty Fifty stocks did in 1972 and Cisco Systems Inc., Lucent Technologies Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. did in 1999 and early 2000, have no margin for error.</p><p>\"Once multiples [of stock prices to earnings] expand beyond what might be justified, if you get an inflation shock, then that's a big headwind for these companies,\" says Lawrence Hamtil of Fortune Financial Advisors LLC in Overland Park, Kan.</p><p>Today, however, several tech giants, including Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. (soon to be \"Meta\") and Google's parent Alphabet Inc., are priced at roughly the same multiples of their current earnings as the S&amp;P 500 overall.</p><p>So, even if the cost of living does spike, it isn't certain that these growth stocks would underperform or that value stocks would trounce them.</p><p>Nor are energy stocks or commodities a foolproof tool.</p><p>Consumer prices rose in 1998, 2001, 2008, 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2020—and yet energy stocks and commodities lost money in all those years, according to Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm in Austin, Texas.</p><p>In four of those years, both of those purported hedges lost more than 10%.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you repositioned your portfolio in anticipation of sustained inflation? Share your thought process in the comments below.</p><p>Because energy stocks and commodities have hammered their investors with a wild mix of gains and losses over time, they \"are not effective hedges against inflation,\" says Savina Rizova, head of research at Dimensional. \"That's a big myth out there. Given the volatility, people are probably in for some very unpleasant surprises if they take that route to hedge against inflation.\"</p><p>Fortunately, the stock market overall has outpaced moderate rises in the cost of living. From 1927 through 2020, according to Dimensional, U.S. stocks as a whole outperformed inflation by an average of 4.9 percentage points annually in years when rises in the cost of living were above the median. If your stock portfolio is already well diversified, it should be able to keep pace with modestly rising prices.</p><p>You can also add TIPS, or Treasury inflation-protected securities. Even though they aren't cheap, they still offer protection against unexpected jumps in consumer prices down the road. So do inflation-protected savings bonds, or I bonds.</p><p>What you probably don't need is to inflate your fees and your risk, for real, to protect against inflation that might turn out to be a phantom.</p><p>Write to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor@wsj.com</p><p>Deflating Your Inflation Fears</p>",
