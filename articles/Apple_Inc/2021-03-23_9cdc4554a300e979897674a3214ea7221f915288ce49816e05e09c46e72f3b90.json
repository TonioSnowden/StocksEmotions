  "text": "<p>Eroding demand are expectations that vaccines and new stimulus money will boost the economy, lifting growth and inflation and reducing the appeal of bonds' fixed payments. Falling bond prices recently pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, a gauge of borrowing costs throughout the economy, above 1.7% for the first time since January 2020.</p><p>Investors typically prize bonds from blue-chip companies such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. because they offer higher returns than government debt, with relatively little additional risk. While fears of widespread downgrades and defaults sparked steep declines during the pandemic's market plunges, moves by the Federal Reserve to support the economy and corporate balance sheets fueled a recovery. Companies borrowed more than $1 trillion, and investment-grade bonds returned 7.5% last year.</p><p>The extra yield investors demand to hold highly rated corporate bonds instead of Treasurys reached 1 percentage point this month, its highest level since December, up from 0.88 percentage point in mid-February. While the gap has since narrowed slightly -- and remains extremely low by historical standards -- it has heightened investors' worries that extended selling in Treasurys could tighten financial conditions and disrupt corporate borrowing.</p><p>Companies are still issuing bonds. They raised over $138 billion through bond sales during the first two months of the year, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. That marks a retreat from the borrowing binge of last spring but remains elevated compared with the same period in 2019.</p><p>With spreads still historically narrow, investors aren't getting properly compensated for riskier corporate debt, said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, which manages around $4 billion in assets. Despite the selloff, his firm has preferred investment-grade corporate bonds with shorter-dated maturities.</p><p>\"The time to chase yield is when spreads are very wide,\" he said. \"When there is no prevalent fear of default, and spreads are very tight, that you only get a few basis points by sacrificing credit quality, history shows that is a bad trade.\"</p><p>The culmination of a yearslong rally that drove yields to record lows left the bonds particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, a measure known as duration, analysts said. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, and the longer the duration of a bond, the steeper the move.</p><p>At around 8 1/2 years, the duration on the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. investment-grade bond index implies an 8.5% change in price for every 1% move in interest rates. That is nearly 40% higher than the average duration from 1992 to 2008, according to data compiled by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, and more than three years higher than it was in the trough of the 2008-09 recession.</p><p>\"There's not a whole lot of buffer in investment-grade corporate-bond yields to manage the interest-rate sensitivity,\" said Josh Chastant, fixed-income analyst at GuideStone Capital Management, an investment manager with over $16 billion in assets.</p><p>Credit quality has fallen to its weakest point in decades. Companies including hotel operator Marriott International Inc. and furniture company Steelcase Inc. suffered downgrades after pandemic borrowing, leaving more than 50% of the U.S. market now at the lowest rung of the investment-grade ladder, according to Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Morgan Stanley and asset manager BlackRock are among many institutions that have recommended that clients cut their holdings of investment-grade bonds relative to stocks or higher-yielding debt such as high-yield bonds and private credit. The latter involves specialist funds making loans to smaller companies that don't trade frequently, often without banks involved.</p><p>Investment-grade corporate bonds in the U.S. are still more attractive to foreign investors compared with those from Europe or the U.K., after adjusting for foreign-exchange hedging costs, some analysts said. With billions of dollars of debt outside the U.S. producing negative returns after taking inflation into account, more foreign investors have turned to the U.S. investment-grade market.</p><p>\"From the perspective of needing to put money to work, foreign investors are getting a better entry point,\" said Josh Lohmeier, portfolio manager at asset manager Aviva Investors.</p><p>Foreign investors added the most investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds to their portfolios in 2020, according to Fed data compiled by research firm CreditSights, followed by life-insurance companies and mutual funds. Together, those three groups held more than $10.7 trillion of company bonds at the end of last year -- or 66% of the total outstanding market.</p><p>Households, hedge funds and private-equity funds were the biggest sellers of corporate bonds last year, dumping a net $16 billion of bonds combined.</p><p>Institutional investors such as pension funds that need to match long-term liabilities with assets aren't always fully hedged on interest rates, said Mr. Lohmeier. Rising yields can help improve funding ratios, pushing such investors to buy more fixed income and cut back on riskier assets such as stocks. His firm is buying investment-grade bonds with maturities ranging from six to eight years or more than 20.</p>",
