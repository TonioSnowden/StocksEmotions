  "text": "<p>\n  \"A young family in Texas requested a moat and drawbridge around their country estate. It sounded like a lot of fun, but unfortunately logistically we just couldn't make it work [within their time frame].\" </p><p>\n  -- Michelle Nussbaumer, interior designer, Dallas </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"For a wraparound terrace on Fifth Avenue, a well-known fashion designer requested a trampoline for her boyfriend, who insisted it was safe, with no netting or railings on the edge. It was 16 stories up. The boyfriend never had an accident, but he wore out his welcome. We removed the trampoline and added planters with peach and apple trees.\" </p><p>\n  -- Janice Parker, landscape architect, New York </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"Our client requested that we accommodate his refurbished World War II Sherman tank that was to be stored in a show garage neatly tucked into the hillside of their 62-acre site. The request was revoked when it was determined that their Belgian-block driveway would be destroyed and have to be repaved every time they took the tank out for a spin.\" </p><p>\n  -- Margie Lavender, architect, Ike Kligerman Barkley, N.Y. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"We were asked to create a miniature golf course and ice skating rink for a Connecticut client. During the warmer months, the kidney-shaped course featured buildings and monuments -- the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty -- to serve as golf holes, and in the cooler months [it was cleared and] chilled to be a skating rink.\" </p><p>\n  -- Chris Pollack, builder/developer, Greenwich, Conn. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"[A client] told me she had begun taking trapeze lessons and would like to install a trapeze above her pool inside a garden pavilion . . . She thought it would provide a unique way to exercise. A local stage-rigging company helped us attach a trapeze to the ceiling beams and equip it with a motorized lift. When finished, she would just drop into the swimming pool.\" </p><p>\n  -- Mark Lavender, interior designer, Chicago </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"We designed an elaborate terrace with wall panels of rusted steel, a water feature, outdoor kitchen -- you name it. The biggest challenge? Meticulously detailing and designing comfortable areas for the dog to go to the bathroom.\" </p><p>\n  -- Brianne Bishop, interior designer, Chicago </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"It was an exhaustive wish list -- a white garden (\"like the one at Sissinghurst Castle,\" the client said), a theater garden (\"like Lotusland\"), a parterre garden (\"like Versailles\"), a Zen garden, children's garden, vineyard, herb garden, veggie garden, outdoor chess . . . And could we complete it in five months and have it look fully grown? Endless midnight design sessions and five months later, the gardens were complete.\" </p><p>\n  -- Margie Grace, landscape designer, Santa Barbara, Calif. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"A young family was looking for ways to incorporate a pool in their backyard, ideally without losing square footage for their children to play and space for them to entertain. They asked if there was technology like a hydraulic retractable floor that would cover the pool. With the right team, their goal was achieved, the first such pool in northeast America.\" </p><p>\n  -- Marguerite Rodgers, interior designer, Philadelphia </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"A movie director's property for his new Los Angeles home featured incredible, ancient pine trees, and his directive to us was 'Do whatever it takes to preserve these trees.' Problem was, the geologists wanted them removed to stabilize the cliff-side property. We had to create some really intense engineering, like tremendous caissons, to stabilize the home while protecting the trees. In the end, the window in one of the rooms basically frames these beautiful, old sacred trees.\" </p><p>\n  -- Chad Oppenheim, architect, Miami </p><p></p>",
