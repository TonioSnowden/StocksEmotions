  "text": "<p>Greetings from rainy Tokyo. This week, I've been looking into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/102e0104-ca6f-4d59-be1b-90860426d5a5?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">cash stimulus cheques</a> from Joe Biden that were mysteriously sent to thousands of Japanese retirees who had worked in the US decades before. It ended as a brief moment of joy before many realised the cheques had been sent erroneously. On a brighter note, the frustratingly slow vaccination programme in Japan has finally started to pick up pace — at least for the elderly — and it has been a relief to hear that my parents have received their first coronavirus jabs. Let's hope the wider population will get access to them soon as well.<br><br>I hope you enjoy my pick of the week's stories, plus a few from elsewhere you shouldn't miss.

This <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/830e05ed-244c-4e9f-a7ac-265c41f79546\">informative piece</a> provides us with the historical context of how the latest Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered by a legal battle over settlers' claims in East Jerusalem. It explains court disputes over property through the prism of two individuals: Nabil al Kurd, a Palestinian, and his unwelcome house guest Yaacov Fauci, a Jew from New York who moved into the tiny annexe Kurd had built for his son in 2009. A religious student turned settler, Fauci has become the face of the dispute:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“If I didn't steal it [the property], someone else will”</p> </blockquote> <h1>2. ‘Speed is our major advantage'</h1> <p>Executives at Japanese carmakers have often told me that they have no intention of becoming suppliers of “moving boxes” as the industry shifts to self-driving electric vehicles. But the rise of battery-powered cars is turning the structure and inner workings of cars upside down, creating a much stronger fusion between autos and electronics. With Kathrin Hille and Peter Campbell, we explored <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b229250d-5d9e-4bb1-bb91-e57888233a98\">the ambitions</a> of Apple iPhone maker Foxconn in electric vehicle manufacturing. While carmakers and traditional suppliers are racing to acquire electronics capabilities, the biggest barrier to electronics groups pushing into the automotive sector are stricter safety standards for vehicles.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“It is OK to crash this computer — you can reboot it. For cars, no way.”&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <h1>3. ‘A looming car crash'</h1> <p>I chose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b956926d-73e0-4167-a256-2abb64563ac0#comments-anchor\">this column</a> by Pilita Clark because this is a topic that has often been on my mind as most companies I cover have presented carbon neutrality targets over the past year. But as Clark notes, the problem is that these groups face rising pressure to be both environmentally and financially stable at a time when the green technologies they need are still on the drawing board. The temptation is to turn to carbon offsets, which studies have shown rarely lead to extra emission cuts. Investors, however, will require companies to meet scientifically credible climate targets.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“Too many corporate net zero goals are too vague and distant. Some smack of abject greenwashing<em>.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h1>4.&#xa0;‘It doesn't have to be like this!'</h1> <p>Conversations over race and injustice can often be emotionally stressful but I highly recommend Gillian Tett's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46890cc0-1616-41e2-a474-8eca870d5917\">lunch interview</a> with Heather McGhee, a 41-year-old American economist, activist and author of a new book on racism. While she decries the damage racism has done to black people, McGhee's message that racism has been hurting us all is powerful. She argues that when white majorities fight to protect their privilege, they often sabotage their own interests. The key is to let go of this zero-sum mentality — the fear among white people that helping black people will create a loss for them:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“If white people understood this self-sabotage, they would have ‘skin in the game' to fight against racism too.”</p> </blockquote> <h1>5.&#xa0;‘Only an idiot would go'</h1> <p>I still have no plans for overseas travel and maybe because I'm stuck in my home country, I was drawn to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2885700a-dd2f-4169-b033-bc518215b788\">this travel piece</a> in the FT's How To Spend It. First of all, the photos are stunning. And the article is beautifully written with a personal touch by Bella Pollen. She walks us through a trip to Jack's Camp, a rough oasis in the desert that became a legendary safari destination in the Kalahari. The place is named after Jack Bousfield, a legendary fourth-generation hunter-explorer, naturalist and raconteur, which has undergone several overhauls under his son Ralph.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“To explore here is to feel reassurance at the earth's ability to regenerate. The world might be sick, but Nature sure knows what it's doing.”</p> </blockquote> <h2>Quick hits</h2> <h4>OTHER FT STORIES THAT HAVE CAUGHT MY EYE THIS WEEK</h4> <ul>  <li><p>How did David Zaslav, the Discovery chief executive, come up with the idea of creating a media behemoth by buying rival WarnerMedia AT&amp;T? Here is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd93a1d8-3127-42e3-beb2-80c02d138013\">the tale</a> of how the deal emerged in the midst of the pandemic. </p></li>  <li><p>Robert Wright examines the UK's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4379314-dbc3-4069-bcc1-f4cfac106d3c\">hostile environment</a> for hidden migrants who are pushed to the roughest margins of society. Government policies have made it difficult for them to work, find accommodation or seek medical treatment. Yet their number keeps swelling.</p></li>  <li><p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62554721-3b52-4cb9-8d1d-ccdf40b4e463\">this scoop</a>, FT reporters reveal that an investment firm founded by the son of China's most powerful financial official has invested heavily in technology companies, including units of leading Chinese internet groups Tencent and JD.com.</p></li>  <li><p>How do you deal with your husband's bitcoin investments in divorce proceedings? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b967bdf-815b-4ea7-a1a1-db87ac49ad4f\">This piece</a> provides the answer. </p></li>  <li><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d74221e-1321-4f8c-9ca9-a4371629f178\">fascinating interview</a> by the FT's Wirecard team, Pav Gill, the reluctant whistleblower who exposed one of Europe's biggest corporate frauds, says doing the right thing ‘always has a cost'. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Best of the rest</h1> <h4>WHAT I'VE BEEN READING ELSEWHERE</h4> <ol>  <li><p><strong>The probe into Bill Gates's relationship with a Microsoft staffer </strong>The news of the divorce of Bill and Melinda Gates was shocking enough without <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803\">this piece</a> revealing a Microsoft investigation into the co-founder's past relationship with a female employee that was deemed inappropriate. Gates said his decision to leave the board last year was unrelated to the matter. (The Wall Street Journal)</p></li>  <li><p><strong>The pros and cons of holding the Tokyo Olympics during a pandemic</strong> There are growing calls for the Tokyo Olympics to be cancelled but an eye-opening expert comment <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Tokyo-2020-Olympics/Pros-and-cons-of-holding-the-Tokyo-Olympics-during-a-pandemic\">in this article</a> suggests that the Olympics venues may be the safest place in Japan come July, given that athletes will mostly be vaccinated and stringent Covid-19 measures will be in place. (Nikkei Asia)</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Confronting hate against east Asians </strong>It has been heartbreaking to witness the rising hate crimes against the Asian community. But Wendy Huynh, who was raised by Chinese parents who immigrated to France in the early 1970s from Vietnam, says she created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/may/19/confronting-hate-against-east-asians-a-photo-essay\">this series of portraits </a>to try to encourage open dialogue about east Asian racism. (The Guardian)</p></li> </ol> <h1>Before you go</h1> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/0685a4ba-7b0b-442b-b38e-3f73101a6943.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>What I'm watching </strong>Here is a thought-provoking FT film written by James Graham exploring the question of whether we can get back the privacy we gave up to fight the global pandemic. It's unlike any FT video I've ever seen or taken part in. Instead of the usual journalists talking, actors Lydia West and Arthur Darvill star in an interrogation scene exploring how Covid-19 exposed the tension between the need for track and trace versus challenges to privacy and justice.</p> <p>We always want to hear your thoughts and feedback, so drop me a line at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanainagaki\">@KanaInagaki</a> or email us at&#xa0;<a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=longstoryshort@ft.com\">longstoryshort@ft.com</a>&#xa0;— and have a lovely weekend.</p> <p><strong>Kana</strong><br><em>Tokyo correspondent</em></p><p>Source: Kana Inagaki 2021 'A selection of the FT's biggest stories and best reads every Friday' FT.com 21 May.
