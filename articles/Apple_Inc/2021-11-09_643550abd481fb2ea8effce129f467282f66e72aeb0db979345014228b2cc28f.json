  "title": "Elon Musk Joins the Tax Debate; The billionaire's contribution is more lyrical than coherent, but what else is new?",
  "text": "<p>And yet a dilemma arises. So much of Tesla's value rests on giddy confidence in Mr. Musk's entrepreneurial prowess, a large voluntary sale might be taken as a signal that he believes the stock has peaked. By putting the decision in Twitter's hands, Mr. Musk cleverly pretends to be taking the decision out of his own hands, and at least the hullabaloo readies the market for an Elon \"liquidity event.\"</p><p>\"I was prepared to accept either outcome,\" Mr. Musk tweeted in seemingly noncommittal fashion on Sunday after the poll favored a sale by 58% to 42%.</p><p>On Saturday, in launching the poll, he floated a red herring seemingly meant to distract from any impression that he might be looking to reduce his overripe Tesla stake. \"Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.\"</p><p>Uh huh. Taxing unrealized gains would indeed be a terrible idea, but this isn't Mr. Musk's situation. He and Tesla's board always knew this day was coming because of how they structured his compensation. Priced into the decision to issue him options were expectations of a giant tax hit if the options ended \"in the money.\" Along with leaving him his intended reward of $10.4 billion, his pay package is expected to generate $12.3 billion for the U.S. and California, a lot more than Tesla has ever paid in corporate income taxes (which just shows how misleading so many discussions of who pays what can be).</p><p>So how much is Mr. Musk using the folderol not merely to cover a tax bill but to lock in some of his Tesla gains? Good question. And why is Tesla worth $1 trillion anyway?</p><p>Some say the magic bean is its leadership in autonomous driving but Tesla's lead doesn't look so magic anymore. Others cite its lithium-ion mastery as the eventual money spinner, but centralized Biden-style climate infrastructure doesn't point to a solar panel on every roof and a Tesla battery in every garage.</p><p>Some have faith in Mr. Musk to conjure Apple-like profits in a future they don't bother to define. Relatively few look upon Tesla as a car company, and that's understandable. If its cars were three times as profitable as GM's and the market were also willing to pay three times as much for each dollar of profit, Tesla would be worth 10% of its current market cap.</p><p>How much is due to Mr. Musk's perceived political juice? In recent years Tesla has been at a disadvantage under Washington's approach to subsidizing electric vehicles, but it might be a winner again under the Joe Biden progressive spendathon struggling to be born in Congress.</p><p>However it may influence valuations, Mr. Musk's seeming ability to defy federal safety and securities regulators is also a net plus.</p><p>An imponderable piled on imponderables is the gusher of Federal Reserve liquidity. Why this should inflate Tesla's stock but not GM's is a puzzle, but the Journal has pointedly noted Tesla's popularity \"among individual investors, subjecting the stock to moves unexplained by fundamentals.\"</p><p>And always the question of whether Mr. Musk himself is the imminent threat to a Tesla bubble. His response to a tax-policy-related tweet from Sen. Ron Wyden was weirdly smutty, albeit not for a 12-year-old. A week earlier, he tweeted a proposal for a \"new university: Texas Institute of Technology &amp; Science,\" noting the potential for \"epic merch.\" If federal market overseers are in a mood to avenge past insults, most problematic may be a stock sale by his brother one day before Elon's Twitter poll.</p><p>But at least Mr. Musk's tweets usefully puncture the class-warfare sanctimony of our current tax debate. In the Scandinavian welfare states that Democrats idolize, middle-class taxpayers pay for middle-class benefits, and willingly, because they perceive their governments to be delivering services efficiently and equitably. The bad faith of Democrats like Mr. Wyden, on so many levels, is evident in their attempt to claim the same can work here as a free lunch paid for by billionaires.</p><p>Since many of Mr. Musk's shareholders appear to have a strained relationship with economics to begin with, any way he can help get the message across is welcome.</p><p>Elon Musk Joins the Tax Debate</p>",
