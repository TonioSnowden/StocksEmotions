  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Fringe Dating Apps Need More Bantr  ---  Lesser-used products might not be worth your money today, but they are definitely worth your time  ----  By Laura Forman",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Ted Lasso is quite the eligible bachelor, but he isn't on Tinder, Bumble or Hinge. He and other characters on Apple TV+'s latest streaming sensation are on Bantr, a fictional dating app centered on playful conversation rather than traditional selfies and swipes. </p><p>\n  And while you can't buy a piece of Bantr, you can still bet on love the Lasso Way by exploring the growing list of fringe dating apps. The sector is unique in that consumers use several apps at a time. Since January 2019, App Annie data show U.S. users have spent a collective average of 7.4 million hours on dating apps a month on Android phones alone. It may seem daunting to compete against the likes of dating giants Match Group and Bumble, which collectively boast more than $50 billion in fully diluted market value, but plenty of businesses are trying. </p><p>\n  Even lesser known apps aren't so small. Coffee Meets Bagel, which hits users with algorithmically curated matches every day at noon, says it has made over 130 million matches since its launch in 2012. Hily, which works to make it easier to start conversations, says it now has more than 22 million users. Snack, which is focused on video-first dating, was the 10th most-downloaded dating app in the U.S. last month, according to App Annie. Ashley Madison, among the top 20 downloaded dating apps in the U.S. last month, is for those in a relationship or marriage looking for . . . something else. </p><p>\n  They get even more granular. The League says its matchmakers are Ivy League educated while Raya blurs the lines between dating and professional networking and is so exclusive it is said to be graced by celebrities. Bristlr is an app for bearded people looking for beard lovers, Lawyr is an app for legal professionals, and Gutsy is an app for those with digestive problems. </p><p>\n  Some just need a larger platform to help them take off. Consider millennial-focused relationship app Hinge, in which Match took a majority stake in 2018 before acquiring it in 2019. App Annie data showed Hinge saw just around 100,000 U.S. downloads in January 2018. By March 2021, it was seeing closer to 600,000. Match said Hinge expanded revenue 150% in the second quarter and is on track to more than double revenue this year after tripling it last year. </p><p>\n  Match bought Hinge in part to diversify away from its hookup app Tinder because people's dating needs change over time. It operates smaller apps in which it sees big potential such as black singles app BLK and Latino dating app Chispa, both of which it developed in-house. It also bought a Cairo-based Islamic dating app in 2019. </p><p>\n  With that in mind, investors would be wise to keep tabs on online dating's smaller players, some of which are publicly traded. Berlin-based Spark Networks, for example, did $233 million in revenue last year -- just over the roughly $200 million that Match has hinted Hinge is on track to deliver this year. Spark operates 13 brands, including Christian Mingle, JDate and Zoosk. With a portfolio skewed toward older users, the company says it has 30% market share in online dating among those 45-plus. </p><p>\n  And then there is eHarmony owner ParshipMeet, which Reuters reported earlier this month is preparing for a 2022 public offering. That company operates eight total brands with a focus on the U.S., U.K. and continental Europe. In the second quarter it had 139 million, equivalent to $164.2 million, in revenue, according to its majority shareholder's half-yearly financial report. </p><p>\n  The dating game is hard work, even for market leaders. Match doesn't disclose Tinder's total users, but it is estimated to have about 70 million of them. Of those, just 9.6 million were paying for service on the app, according to Match's second-quarter results. </p><p>\n  Smaller companies might one day turn out to be gems in their own right, but most aren't there yet. Spark, for example, put up an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margin of about 16% last year -- well below Bumble's 26% and Match's 37%. But if it takes off, investors buying in now would get it on the cheap: Spark's shares fetch less than five times enterprise value to forward Ebitda. Match and Bumble trade at an average of around 36 times. </p><p>\n  Investing in love may be tricky, but finding it can really pay off. </p><p></p>",
