  "text": "<p>Credit Suisse has received a number of proposals from investors interested in CS First Boston. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann at a conference on Thursday said it has other firm commitments in addition to the $500 million from the unnamed investor. The bank hasn't received a formal proposal from any Saudi entity, some of the people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Credit Suisse is spinning off the New York-based investment bank as part of a fresh start after being buffeted by scandals, regulatory scrutiny and steep losses. It is raising $4.2 billion in new stock that separately will make Saudi National Bank its largest shareholder. It isn't clear if Prince Mohammed would make the investment through that bank, or another investment vehicle. He is chairman of the country's sovereign-wealth fund, Public Investment Fund, which along with another government fund is Saudi National Bank's main owner.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Apple makes plans to move production out of China.</p><p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried says he can't account for billions sent to Alameda.</p><p>Saudi crown prince set to invest in Credit Suisse's new investment bank</p>",
