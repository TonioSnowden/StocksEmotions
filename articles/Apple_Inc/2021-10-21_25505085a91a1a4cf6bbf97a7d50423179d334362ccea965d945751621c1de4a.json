  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON—Big tech companies are facing questions from the government on another front: how they use consumers' financial and other information.</p><p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday said it had launched an inquiry on consumer data practices at Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. and other firms. The move opens a new front in Washington's scrutiny of the companies.</p><p>The bureau issued orders seeking information from the companies that would help it \"better understand how these firms use personal payments data and manage data access to users.\" All of the companies are engaged in consumer-facing financial services or have ambitions to expand in that sector.</p><p>\"Big Tech companies are eagerly expanding their empires to gain greater control and insight into our spending habits,\" said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, in a statement. \"We have ordered them to produce information about their business plans and practices.\"</p><p>The questions from the agency are broad in scope. They range from inquiries about how consumer data that flows through the companies is used in lending or other decisions to how data determines what ads consumers are shown. In all, the companies face demands to answer dozens of questions while the bureau also said it plans to seek public comment on the requests.</p><p>The action by the CFPB is the latest move by the Biden administration to scrutinize big technology companies. It has appointed individuals who say lax antitrust enforcement, especially in the tech sector, has allowed dominant firms to hobble rivals and stifle competition. They include Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan and Tim Wu, special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy.</p><p>Republican and Democratic lawmakers have also called for tougher regulation, such as strengthening privacy and competition laws.</p><p>Mr. Chopra, who was sworn in as the CFPB's new director on Oct. 12, previously worked with Ms. Khan at the FTC. He told Senate lawmakers he would make it a priority to look into issues such as data privacy. While at the FTC in 2019, Mr. Chopra joined another Democrat in objecting to a $5 billion settlement with Facebook over a probe into the tech giant's privacy missteps, contending it wasn't tough enough.</p><p>\"It will…be critical for the CFPB to take a hard look at how big tech companies and others are entering financial services, the impact on our privacy and our personal data,\" he said at a March hearing.</p><p>Two other firms subject to the information demands are expected to include payment processors Square Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., the people said.</p><p>The bureau said it would also study the practices of Chinese tech giants that offer payments services.</p><p>Facebook and Google spokesmen declined to comment. An Amazon spokeswoman didn't comment. Representatives of Apple, Square and PayPal didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\"We look forward to working with Director Chopra and the CFPB on this important effort,\" said Jodie Kelley, chief executive of the Electronic Transactions Association, which represents all of the companies subject to Thursday's order except Facebook. \"The digital transactions industry has a good story to tell about its efforts to protect consumer data.\"</p><p>The CFPB has been politically polarizing since former President Barack Obama tapped Elizabeth Warren, then a Harvard law professor, to set it up. Ms. Warren, a Democrat, is now a U.S. senator representing Massachusetts.</p><p>Democrats have wanted a muscular CFPB to take on what they characterize as financial-industry excesses. Republicans and Wall Street firms have criticized the bureau as an instrument of excessive government regulation, with too much power over a significant slice of the economy.</p><p>The banking industry, a frequent target of CFPB rules, said it welcomed the move to scrutinize technology firms, as it could put the companies on a more level playing field with lenders.</p><p>\"Since the Bureau was founded, a growing share of banking activity has occurred outside of the purview of leading regulators, putting consumers and the resiliency of the financial system at risk,\" said Richard Hunt, president and chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association.</p><p>The CFPB's demands from the companies could presage a push to make it easier for consumers to switch between financial firms. A July executive order from Mr. Biden encouraged the CFPB to issue rules allowing customers to download their banking data and take it to another institution. The directive was part of a broader executive order aimed at promoting competition in a number of industries.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com and AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com</p><p>Consumer Protection Agency Probes How Apple, Facebook, Amazon Use Financial Data</p>",
