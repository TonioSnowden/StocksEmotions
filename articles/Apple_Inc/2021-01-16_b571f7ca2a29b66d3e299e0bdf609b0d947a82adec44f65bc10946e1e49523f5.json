  "text": "<p><strong>Keeley Hawes, 44, was nominated for a Bafta for her performance in&#xa0;the BBC's </strong><em><strong>Line of Duty</strong></em><strong>. Her other television appearances include roles in </strong><em><strong>Bodyguard</strong></em><strong>, </strong><em><strong>Spooks</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>The Durrells</strong></em></p> <p><strong>What was your childhood or earliest ambition? </strong><br>To be a ballerina. Then I fell into acting and went to drama school — the Sylvia Young Theatre School.&#xa0;From then on, that was all&#xa0;I&#xa0;wanted to do. </p> <p><strong>Private school or state school? University or straight into work? </strong><br>A state primary school close to where I grew up in Marylebone. Sylvia Young moved premises to Lisson Grove, opposite the house I lived in. Had that not happened, I'm not sure I would even have known there was such a thing as theatre school — how could you at&#xa0;nine? I came from a big working-class family and it was a private school. Sylvia generously gave me&#xa0;a&#xa0;grant, and I worked quite a bit as a&#xa0;child actor.</p> <p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor? </strong><br>Two brilliant teachers, one speech and drama, Jackie Stoker, and a drama teacher called Clive — I don't know his surname, we just called him Clive. I wanted to do well for&#xa0;them — to do better for them. They were a big part of the person I've become. </p> <p><strong>How physically fit are you? </strong><br>Probably more fit than I've been in a long time. I've been having personal training sessions. I thought I'd hate it — I'm not big on exercise. But I'm really enjoying it. It's very good for me mentally and I'm feeling stronger and stronger. </p> <p><strong>Ambition or talent: which matters more to success? </strong><br>A little bit of both, and a little bit of luck. </p> <p><strong>How politically committed are&#xa0;you? </strong><br>I'm certainly committed to the Emily Maitlis <em>Americast</em> podcast on BBC Sounds. I vote and I take an interest. The political landscape has changed so much over the past four years — the only good thing to come out of that is that people have become more politicised. My&#xa0;teenage children connect more with politics than I did at their age. </p> <p><strong>What would you like to own that you don't currently possess? </strong><br>I've got a red poodle called Buster and I would happily bring more of those into my life. He is so bright&#xa0;and funny and clever, and a&#xa0;great companion. </p> <p><strong>What's your biggest extravagance? </strong><br>It was travel&#xa0;— not any more. Cashmere trousers are an extravagance, but also a necessity. </p> <p><strong>In what place are you happiest? </strong><br>I love our home and everything it&#xa0;represents. </p> <p><strong>What ambitions do you still have? </strong><br>I love my job and I feel very lucky to&#xa0;have it, but I'm not ambitious — I&#xa0;don't feel like that, I&#xa0;never have. I&#xa0;recently started a production company and I would like to&#xa0;succeed at that endeavour. </p> <p><strong>What is the greatest achievement of your life so far? </strong><br>My children. They're kind, funny, nice people. I love being with them. </p> <p><strong>What do you find most irritating in other people?</strong><br>I try to find the good in people. But&#xa0;spitting, and texting and driving make me want to scream.&#xa0;And meanness isn't a great&#xa0;trait. </p> <p><strong>If your 20-year-old self could see you now, what would she think? </strong><br>She'd be amazed that I don't put make-up on to go out of the house!&#xa0;I&#xa0;would hope she'd be quite proud. Things I really worried about when I was 20 wouldn't even be on my radar now. So I think she'd&#xa0;be quite pleased to see my shoulders have relaxed a bit. </p> <p><strong>Which object that you've lost do you wish you still had? </strong><br>I try not to give material things too much weight. I'm very good at getting rid of them. </p> <p><strong>What is the greatest challenge of&#xa0;our time?</strong><br>Climate, because ultimately, without our world intact, none of the others really matter. We need to listen to the younger generation, hear their worries. </p> <p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife? </strong><br>No, though I am quite envious of people who do, because I can imagine it's very comforting. So&#xa0;be&#xa0;nice to everyone and have a&#xa0;good time! </p> <p><strong>If you had to rate your satisfaction with your life so far, out of 10, what would you score? </strong><br>In terms of how lucky I've been, it would be churlish for me to say anything other than 10. Without sounding smug, I've been very blessed. I can only answer for today&#xa0;— who knows what might happen tomorrow?</p> <p><em>Keeley Hawes appears in the Channel 4 series “It's a Sin”</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
