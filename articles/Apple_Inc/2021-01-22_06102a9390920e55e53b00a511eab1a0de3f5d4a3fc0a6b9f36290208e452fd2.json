  "title": "Intel to Outsource More Chips  ---  Incoming CEO unveils  major production shift  as company faces  several challenges  ----  By Asa Fitch",
  "text": "<p>   Intel Corp.'s incoming chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, said the semiconductor giant would outsource more chip production as it posted pandemic-fueled full-year results that also underscore the breadth of challenges the new CEO will face. </p><p>   Mr. Gelsinger on Thursday said Intel would have other chip makers produce more of its products, even if the bulk of its new chips in the coming few years would be made in house. The move still marks a major break from the past, when Intel largely relied on its own factories to make its most advanced chips, effectively an acknowledgment that it has fallen behind chip-making rivals. </p><p>   The report for 2020 caps a challenging yet lucrative year for the semiconductor giant that saw it surpassed in market valuation by rival Nvidia Corp., dropped by Apple Inc. as a supplier for Mac chips, suffer market-share losses and face a push by activist investor Third Point LLC for strategic changes. </p><p>   \"Intel has gone through cycles before,\" Mr. Gelsinger said. \"Great companies are able to come back from periods of difficulty and challenge, and they come back stronger, better and more capable than ever. And that, I believe, is the opportunity at Intel.\" </p><p>   The pandemic has helped Intel paper over some of its challenges. PC demand hasn't been this hot in years. Intel posted record sales of $77.9 billion for 2020, up from $72 billion the year prior and ahead of the $75.4 billion Wall Street expected. </p><p>   While Intel has benefited from a boom in demand for PCs in the work-from-home economy, much of the added buying has focused on lower-cost laptops that aren't as profitable. And the company faces growing competition that is weighing on its bottom line. Net income for 2020 came in at $20.9 billion, down from $21.1 billion in the year-prior period. </p><p>   The company said it rushed out its results because of potentially unauthorized access to some earnings-related information. It posted the earnings minutes before the market close rather than after. </p><p>   Intel shares rose more than 6% Thursday after it also boosted its cash dividend, though it gave up some of those share gains in after-hours trading. </p><p>   Departing CEO Bob Swan said, \"Intel is in a strong strategic and financial position as we make this leadership transition and take Intel to the next level.\" </p><p>   Intel's complete longer-term strategy around the outsourcing of chip production is in flux ahead of the arrival of Mr. Gelsinger. Mr. Swan said last year that a decision was forthcoming by early this year on whether to have the company's advanced chips made by a third party after Intel fell behind Asian rivals in the development of the next generation of superfast semiconductors. </p><p>   On Thursday's call, Mr. Swan said a decision on whether to outsource production of Intel's latest central processing unit would await Mr. Gelsinger formally joining. </p><p>   The company is considering outsourcing production of some of its most prized chips to those Asian rivals, particularly to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the largest and most advanced contract chip maker in the world, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Intel already has decided to send out production of coming graphics-processing chips to TSMC, and the companies have been in talks about deepening their relationship further. Mr. Swan visited TSMC to discuss potential options in December, according to a person familiar with the trip. </p><p>   TSMC last year announced plans to build a chip factory in Arizona, its second in the U.S. The company last week said it planned record capital expenditures of as much as $28 billion this year, a huge increase from last year and an indication, in some analysts' eyes, that new business from Intel is on the way. </p><p>   The selection of Mr. Gelsinger, the chief executive of VMware Inc. who spent three decades at Intel earlier in his career, was widely hailed. But analysts expect the turnaround in an industry where product-development cycles are measured in years, not months, to take time. </p><p>   \"It's a good thing to bring in someone new, and particularly someone who has worked at Intel and has a tech background, but whatever path they follow, it will take time to implement,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Matthew Bryson said ahead of earnings. </p><p></p>",
