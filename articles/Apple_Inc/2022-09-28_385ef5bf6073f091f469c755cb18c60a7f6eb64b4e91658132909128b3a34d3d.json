  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 600 points, or about 2%. Both indexes had fallen for six straight days as of Tuesday, and earlier this week the Dow joined the S&amp;P 500 in a bear market. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.1%.</p><p>Bond yields swiveled after the Bank of England said it would begin buying U.K. government bonds in a bid to stabilize markets. In the U.S., the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly climbed above 4% for the first time in more than a decade, only to quickly slide back down. By Wednesday afternoon, the 10-year yield registered its steepest one-day drop since March 2009.</p><p>Stocks this year have come under increasing pressure as investors focus on soaring inflation and central banks' efforts to fight it with higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve last week raised rates for the fifth time this year.</p><p>More signs are pointing to slowing economic growth, including, by one measure, the first monthly decline in house prices in years.</p><p>In recent days, investors have turned their attention to the U.K. The British government last week unveiled the country's biggest tax cuts in decades. The news spooked investors and sent the yield on the 10-year sovereign bond soaring earlier this week.</p><p>The situation lifted interest rates elsewhere, including the U.S. And as rates climbed, investors had more places to put their money for returns and stocks looked more expensive.</p><p>On Wednesday, though, bond yields came back to earth after the Bank of England said it would buy U.K. government bonds with long maturities \"on whatever scale is necessary.\" That helped drive Wednesday's rise in U.S. stocks, said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities for UBS's global wealth management business.</p><p>\"For the last several trading days, the pressure on U.S. stocks has been a reflection of some of the turmoil in the fixed-income market,\" Mr. Lefkowitz said. \"As that turmoil settles down, we're seeing a better tone for equities.\"</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.707% from 3.963% Tuesday, a massive move in bond-market terms. Yields rise when bond prices fall.</p><p>\"There's fear that the whole system collapses and demand is not able to withstand this amount of rate hikes,\" said Agnes Belaisch, a chief strategist at Barings Investment Institute. \"There are pieces of evidence out there that could be signs of recession.\"</p><p>Global crude-oil benchmark Brent gained 3.5% to $89.32 a barrel.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on Twitter that damage to the Nord Stream pipelines that deliver Russian gas to central Europe was the result of sabotage. Russian state-owned Gazprom issued what analysts said appeared to be a threat to cut exports of the fuel through Ukraine.</p><p>In U.S. trading, shares of Biogen were up 39% after the company said its experimental Alzheimer's drug significantly slowed the disease's progression in a large study. Its partner in the study, Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai, rose 17% in Tokyo trading.</p><p>Apple shares slipped 2.6% after Bloomberg reported that the company is dropping plans to boost iPhone production.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%. In Asia, most major benchmarks fell. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 3.4%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Head Higher as Bond Yields Swing</p>",
