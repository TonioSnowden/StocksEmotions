  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- Sam Voutas, an Australian writer and filmmaker, remembers clearly the first time he saw the billboard in China a decade ago: A Steve Jobs look-alike with a quizzical expression touting a luminous white mattress. The brand was De Rucci, and the slogan read: \"Sleep system. Healthy sleep.\" </p><p>   \"Who is this mattress maestro?\" Mr. Voutas recalled thinking. </p><p>   Toni Koraza, a 29-year-old marketing agency founder, saw the slim, gray-bearded De Rucci man in ads everywhere when he lived in China in 2019 and 2020. \"He's in the background of so many of my pictures,\" he said. Mr. Koraza called the Westerner's omnipresence and recognizability \"genius in the internet age,\" and in one publication he declared it was \"The Most Famous Face in China.\" </p><p>   A generation of expatriates and world travelers passed the man slapped on billboards at airports in the U.S., Australia and China, not knowing his true identity. The mystery spawned Reddit threads, blog posts and YouTube videos by fans seeking his name. </p><p>   The first clue surfaced on page 227 of a 777-page prospectus filed last year by De Rucci Healthy Sleep Co. The document was submitted to stock-market regulators in the southern Chinese metropolis of Shenzhen by the company, which is seeking to raise more than $60 million in an initial public offering. </p><p>   A sentence revealed that on Aug. 15, 2009, De Rucci signed an agreement of undisclosed value with Timothy James Kingman to use his image in perpetuity for advertising. </p><p>   Rather than sate the curious, the disclosure triggered more questions about Mr. Kingman and the company that raised his visage from obscurity to ubiquity. </p><p>   De Rucci at one time claimed to have been founded in 1868 by a Frenchman named Leonardo de Rucci. Pressed by skeptics about its vaunted history, De Rucci expunged mention of the fanciful Mr. de Rucci from its website and updated its slogan to describe the company as having been \"founded on nostalgia for 1868.\" It has since dropped that bit as well. </p><p>   In fact, De Rucci was founded in the Chinese city of Dongguan in 2004 by Wang Bingkun and Lin Jiyong. In 2020, De Rucci rang up $690 million in sales from its 4,200 stores in China as well as its glitzy showrooms in Paris, Los Angeles and Melbourne. </p><p>   The company referred to its prospectus in response to a request for comment, noting it was currently in the so-called silent period before its IPO. </p><p>   Amber Concas, based in Pisa, Italy, was so intrigued she made an eight-minute YouTube video about the figure she called \"the most famous unknown man ever.\" </p><p>   The Wall Street Journal in its own examination of public records found no person named Timothy James Kingman in the U.S. and no one with that name registered living in China. A public-records database turned up an American named \"Timothy J. Kingman,\" born in 1943 and who died on June 1, 2012. There was virtually no other information about him, other than a Social Security number and a P. O. box in Neotsu, Ore. </p><p>   Public records linked him to a John Timothy Dirstine, who died the same day and had the same Social Security number and post office box. </p><p>   A short obituary for Mr. Dirstine was published in the Seattle Times on June 10, 2012. It said he had studied at Stanford University and fought in the Vietnam War and before spending two decades living abroad, mainly in China. Mr. Dirstine died of complications following surgery for a brain tumor on May 31, 2012, leaving an ex-wife but no children, according to the obituary. </p><p>   On technology forums, a user who signed his posts in the mid-2000s with the name \"Timothy Kingman\" described himself as an English teacher living in China, looking for tips to help students with listening comprehension. </p><p>   Mr. Dirstine's sister, Joann Hansen, of Port Hadlock-Irondale, Wash., said her brother had lived in China during his later years but was puzzled by the notion that he was featured in ads world-wide. She shared little else about him. </p><p>   A photo in the alumni magazine of Seattle Preparatory School, where Mr. Dirstine graduated from high school in 1962, showed him as a young tuxedoed man, with the same unmistakable features as China's mattress man. </p><p>   Mr. Voutas, the writer, suspects Mr. Dirstine was paid to be photographed by De Rucci, which may have sought a Western model to portray an international pedigree. Such advertising gigs, known as \"face jobs,\" were once common in China. Now they are criticized. </p><p>   China's women's volleyball team is more likely to be seen advertising De Rucci mattresses these days. The company last year released a music video featuring a choir of middle-aged Chinese mothers extolling good sleep. \"You may dream of losing weight in your dreams,\" they sang, \"but the risk of getting fat doubles for those who stay up late.\" </p><p>   The face of De Rucci is fading from view, serving mainly now as the avatar on the company's social media. Fans remain astounded at how a few photos opened such an uncanny path to fame. </p><p>   \"You didn't have to be extraordinary in any way,\" Mr. Voutas said. \"It was the story built around you that was extraordinary.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jim Oberman and Zhao Yueling contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
