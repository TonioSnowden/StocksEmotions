  "text": "<p>Ahead of the bell, shares of Ford Motor jumped more than 8%. The car maker late Wednesday restored its dividend and raised guidance for profits in 2021. eBay shares slid more than 5% premarket after the online marketplace gave projections for earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations.</p><p>Forecast-beating results have soothed worries that supply-chain difficulties would dent profits, sending stocks higher in October. Earnings season continues at pace, with Amazon and Apple due to report after markets close.</p><p>\"Earnings growth has been very strong,\" said Kiran Ganesh, multiasset strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, adding that investors had also taken succor from slow progress in Washington toward legislation that would raise taxes on companies and wealthy individuals.</p><p>Shares of Carlyle Group rose 3.3% premarket after the private-equity firm reported a jump in third-quarter earnings. Twilio, the acquisitive communications software firm, slid 14% after projecting a wider loss for the fourth quarter than analysts had expected.</p><p>The broader market has remained jittery as investors, lawmakers and central banks navigate the uneven economic recovery from the pandemic. Stocks fell Wednesday, for example, after the Bank of Canada's decision to end quantitative easing sparked volatility in global bond markets.</p><p>The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose to 1.540% Thursday from 1.528% Wednesday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Data on how fast the U.S. economy grew in the third quarter will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Growth likely cooled as households and businesses confronted supply-chain disruptions, labor-market mismatches and the Covid-19 Delta variant. There is a range of estimates as to how much the economy slowed.</p><p>Energy prices fell. Benchmark European gas futures fell more than 7% after Russian President Vladimir Putin told state energy giant Gazprom to fill its storage sites in Europe from early November. The instruction eased fears among traders that Europe will run short of gas this winter.</p><p>Overseas markets were broadly lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 traded flat, as gains for food-and-drink stocks offset losses for auto makers. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, reported a rise in revenue and profits, boosting shares by 8.9%. Volkswagen's preferred shares lost 3.3% after the car maker said a shortage of semiconductors slammed production in the September quarter.</p><p>Royal Dutch Shell shares slipped 2.1% after the energy company said it would halve emissions by 2030. The stock jumped Wednesday when The Wall Street Journal reported that Daniel Loeb's Third Point had taken a big stake in Shell and urged the company to break up.</p><p>The euro wavered around $1.1612 after the European Central Bank left its key interest rates unchanged. Earlier, the Bank of Japan maintained its target for short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% and its target for 10-year government bond yields at around zero.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1%, China's Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.3%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise Ahead of GDP Data</p>",
