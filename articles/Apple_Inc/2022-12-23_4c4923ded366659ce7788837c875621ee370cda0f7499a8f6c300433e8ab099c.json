  "text": "<p>   Mr. Musk's plan to offer paying subscribers blue check marks -- which previously signified that a user's identity had been verified -- backfired last month as some users impersonated several well-known brands. Ad-buying firms scrambled to help their spoofed clients, frantically calling Twitter sales representatives, say people familiar with the situation. Twitter paused Twitter Blue and relaunched it in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. on Dec. 12. </p><p>   Meanwhile, Twitter's layoffs, which cut thousands of jobs, sparked advertisers' concerns that the company didn't have enough staff to properly service brands, ad buyers said. </p><p>   Mr. Musk also showed that he was willing to call out brands in public. He took aim briefly at Apple Inc., asking \"Do they hate free speech in America?\" Though Mr. Musk said the companies quickly resolved the dispute, ad buyers said the outburst was noticed on Madison Avenue. </p><p>   Mr. Musk acknowledged some mistakes in a Dec. 1 meeting with another important group, the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, an ad industry trade group that works to improve safety standards online. In the session, he said Twitter had launched the new version of Twitter Blue too hastily. The Twitter team said the proposed content moderation council was still under consideration, according to people who attended. </p><p>   Mr. Musk agreed that Twitter would explore letting outside firms assess the prevalence of harmful content on the platform, so that brands don't have to rely on Twitter's own evaluation, said people who attended the meeting. </p><p>   \"I think he's recognized that there's a certain way to operate within this industry,\" said Robert Rakowitz, co-founder and lead of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, who attended the meeting. \"If he's serious about having advertisers, there needs to be a trade-off.\" </p><p></p>",
