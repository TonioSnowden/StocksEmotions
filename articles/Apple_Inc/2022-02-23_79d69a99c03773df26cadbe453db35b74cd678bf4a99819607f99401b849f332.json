  "title": "Making TikTok Videos Leaves Musicians Feeling Burnout; Self-promotion has always been a part of being a music star. Some musicians say they are now spending more time on marketing than music.",
  "text": "<p>Her post touched a nerve. Stars like Ryan Tedder, Maren Morris and Niall Horan praised her candor. \"There was a collective 'yes' within the artist community,\" Maggie Rose, 33, a Nashville singer-songwriter, says in an interview. It \"felt like a rally cry and a sigh of relief all at once.\"</p><p>Mastering social media is part of being a modern pop star, but some musicians say they have had enough. Industry executives push artists to maintain busy feeds on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter, tasks that they say leave them with too little time to focus on writing and performing. The pressure is particularly acute for up-and-coming and midsize acts, who have built audiences but not enough of a business to hire digital-promotion teams to handle posts.</p><p>Even superstars are feeling it. Post Malone recently told Billboard he had felt overwhelmed by industry pressures. \"You think about everything at the same time, and it's f—ing overload,\" he told the magazine.Making a living as a musician has never been easy. Self-promotion is a prerequisite—whether it is passing out fliers for shows, waking early for radio interviews or making music videos. The pandemic exacerbated things by pushing a lot of marketing online.</p><p>Interviews with artists, executives and analysts suggest that the problem runs deeper than the pandemic. The democratization of music, they say, has come at a cost.Armed with laptops and streaming and social media, musicians can make, release, distribute and promote music without the help of record labels. Virality on YouTube and TikTok offers new routes to success that bypass traditional gatekeepers. Artists can experiment with snippets of incomplete songs on social media, effectively conducting market research in real time.Yet building a sustainable career—and life—has arguably become more difficult. Streaming doesn't pay the way CDs did, and the model encourages artists to stay in the news so listeners are reminded to click on songs. Spotify Technology SA says it already pays roughly 70% of its revenue to rights holders, including labels. Even if it paid more, the glut of artists and releases puts downward pressure on average incomes, analysts say.</p><p>The number of self-releasing artists increased by a third in 2020 to five million, outpacing growth in streaming revenue, according to MIDiA Research, an entertainment-analysis firm. Spotify says more than 60,000 new tracks are uploaded each day.To stand out, some artists are releasing music more often, giving priority to quantity over quality. One common fear, executives say: If artists don't keep hitting Spotify and Apple Music with new songs, their monthly listener numbers will fall, hurting their reputations in a numbers-obsessed industry.</p><p>Constant making of social posts, meanwhile, aims to keep the artist top of mind for fans who might stream music, buy concert tickets or snap up merchandise. Artists feel the need to focus on their public personas as much as their music.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How can musicians get back to the basics despite industry pressures? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Noah Kahan, 25, who, like Ms. Cutler, is signed to Republic Records, says there isn't a songwriting or recording session or label meeting—\"hell, even a phone call\"—without the mention of TikTok. Industry professionals have advised him to make a TikTok a day, music-related or not.</p><p>TikTok helps with reaching fans and trying out music, but Mr. Kahan says it has affected his songwriting in \"deeply disturbing\" ways. For example, he focuses more on hooky, viral verses and choruses than on finishing whole songs.</p><p>\"If you're a young artist or songwriter who creates beautiful music with a process that requires time, space, contemplation and privacy, you are going to have a really sh— time here,\" he says.</p><p>Ms. Rose, the Nashville singer-songwriter, says she has made peace with social media, but still feels a \"constant nagging of guilt\" that she isn't posting more. \"There are a lot of other artists who don't play their TikTok lottery-ticket every day, but we are often met with a 'guess you don't want it that badly' mindset from others within the industry, which is maddening.\"Another frustration for artists is that it is hard to predict what kind of moves on TikTok and other social media will deliver results. It is also unclear whether all the effort translates into money. Ms. Cutler, after all, made waves on social media by complaining about it.The confusion is \"the product of everyone not knowing what works right now,\" she says in an interview.</p><p>Talking openly about burnout could help, executives say, though many artists fear appearing spoiled for complaining about what some view as a dream job.</p><p>Tamar Kaprelian, co-founder and chief executive of Nvak Collective, a small indie label that says it gives priority to artists' well-being, says highly individualized care—weekly conversations about how hard artists are going, for example—can mitigate burnout. When one of Nvak's artists, Talia Lahoud, struggled with depression, the label found her a therapist. (In certain cases, Nvak covers the cost of therapy; with Ms. Lahoud, a clinical psychologist provided services pro bono.) Ms. Lahoud took about a month off writing and recording and pushed back a single-release timeline. \"We basically waited,\" Ms. Kaprelian says. \"We said, 'Tell us when you're feeling better.' \"</p><p>Ms. Cutler, an electronic-pop artist with more than 300,000 Instagram followers, found herself venting to her girlfriend, who encouraged her to post her thoughts online.</p><p>Marketing \"is not my job—and I don't want it to be my job,\" Ms. Cutler told The Wall Street Journal. \"That's not what I'm good at.\"</p><p>Write to Neil Shah at Neil.Shah@wsj.com</p><p>Making TikTok Videos Leaves Musicians Feeling Burnout</p>",
