  "text": "<p>Apple posted double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2021 in all of its businesses, led by iPhone sales that surged by two-thirds from a year ago.</p> <p>The world's most valuable publicly listed company said revenue was up 54 per cent in its fiscal quarter to $89.6bn, far exceeding already elevated forecasts of $77bn. Net profits jumped 110 per cent to $23.6bn.</p> <p>Total iPhone sales increased 66 per cent, bringing in $47.9bn — or 54 per cent of all revenues — as consumers the world over upgraded their handsets to the first line-up of 5G-enabled iPhones.</p> <p>Luca Maestri, Apple's finance chief, told the Financial Times that every region grew at least 35 per cent, led by a 94 per cent gain in Asia-Pacific to $7.5bn. In the Americas, its biggest region, revenue grew 35 per cent to $34.3bn.</p> <p>Revenue in China grew 87 per cent to $17.7bn, as different model iPhones were the top-two selling smartphones in the country. </p> <p>“Keep in mind a year ago China was the region most disrupted by Covid because they went into lockdown earlier than anyone,” Maestri said.</p> <p>Paolo Pescatore, technology analyst and founder of PP Foresight, called it an “exceptional set of results” that should prove sticky as the iPhone “remains a core product and gateway to the Apple universe”.</p> <p>Tim Cook, chief executive, said the results reflected “the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives”. He added: “Apple is in a period of sweeping innovation across our product line-up.”</p> <p>Mac sales grew 70 per cent to $9.1bn and iPad sales surged 79 per cent to $7.8bn. Maestri said the past three quarters have been the biggest ever for the Mac, a product that goes back three decades, thanks in large part to the work-from-home trend.</p> <p>Apple's Wearables business, comprising AirPods, Apple Watches and accessories, grew 25 per cent to $7.8bn. This made it the slowest of all five categories, even as it set a record for its March quarter.</p> <p>Maestri said the services division, which includes App Store revenue and licensing, also set a record thanks to 660m paid subscriptions, up 40m from the previous three months. Its revenue was $16.9bn, up 27 per cent, growth that was about 10 percentage points above forecasts.</p> <p>Gross margins jumped to 42.5 per cent, a nine-year high and the first time any quarter's margin has exceeded 40 per cent since 2015.</p> <p>With cash continuing to pile up on its balance sheet, Apple announced a $90bn share buyback programme. It also said that “supply constraints” would hurt sales by $3bn-$4bn in the current quarter, as chip shortages slow sales of iPads and Macs.</p> <p>Apple shares rose more than 2 per cent in after-hours trading.</p><p>Source: Patrick McGee in San Francisco 2021 'Apple revenues up 54% as consumers snap up 5G-enabled iPhones' FT.com 28 April.
