  "title": "Supply-Chain Pain Is Maersk's Gain as $5.44 Billion Profit Dwarfs Amazon, UPS; Record freight rates and supply-chain snarls drive quarterly gains at shipping giant",
  "text": "<p>Sales tell a different story, however, as Amazon's businesses across e-commerce, cloud services and entertainment totaled $110.81 billion in the most recent period. Package-delivery giant UPS recorded $23.18 billion in sales and Maersk had $16.61 billion.</p><p>Maersk, which operates hundreds of cargo ships, hasn't historically enjoyed such hefty profits. It posted net losses for the years 2016, 2017 and 2019. This is how profits at the same companies looked a year ago, when the Covid-19 pandemic triggered lockdowns, upended business and sparked a jump in e-commerce orders.</p><p>Maersk's latest quarterly profit is still not among the top 10 of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far. That list is dominated by technology giants such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Maersk is expanding beyond its ocean-shipping routes. On Tuesday, the company said it was buying airfreight forwarder Senator International in a deal worth $644 million. In conjunction with the deal, Maersk is leasing three Boeing 767 freighters and has ordered two new Boeing 777s for its fleet.</p><p>Dominic Chopping and Costas Paris contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Bowdeya Tweh at Bowdeya.Tweh@wsj.com</p><p>Supply-Chain Pain Is Maersk's Gain as $5.44 Billion Profit Dwarfs Amazon, UPS</p>",
