  "text": "<p>   Mr. McCaffrey, the 80-year-old retired research scientist, has been buying Apple shares in recent weeks, automating the purchases for when the price is below a certain level. But overall, watching shares of his favored tech companies erode has been a gloomy experience. Apple is down 23% so far this year. </p><p>   \"It's getting worse for people in my age group,\" Mr. McCaffrey said, \"simply because we don't have time to wait for it to come back.\" </p><p>   It takes a lot to shake Kevin Landis, a fund manager whose tech-focused fund was battered by the tech wreckage of the early 2000s. </p><p>   But when Netflix announced disappointing quarterly results in April, Mr. Landis, sitting in his home office overlooking his tranquil suburban San Jose backyard, felt as if he'd been hit by an earthquake. He had reason to be concerned: Roku, another streaming company, made up 14% of his tech fund at the end of March. He says he hasn't sold any shares, even though Roku's stock has sunk by nearly 60% this year. </p><p>   \"Probably the defining difference this time is last time I could just storm out of the office and go home,\" he said. \"This time, I'm working from home. So there's no escaping it.\" </p><p></p>",
