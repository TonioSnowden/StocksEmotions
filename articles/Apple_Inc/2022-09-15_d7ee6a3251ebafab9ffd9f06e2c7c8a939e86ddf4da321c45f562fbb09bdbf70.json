  "title": "Tesla has one less bear after Needham upgrades, citing several reasons to expect a stock rally; Needham transfers coverage of Tesla to analyst Vikram Bagri, who subsequently upgrades EV maker to hold",
  "text": "<p>\"We believe the stock is fairly priced, and we do not see a catalyst for underperformance in the near-term,\" Bagri wrote in a note to clients, with \"Catch me if you can\" in the title. \"In fact, we see several potential catalysts that could drive the stock higher.\"</p><p>Tesla's stock TSLA climbed 1.2% in morning trading toward a one-month high. It has run up 13.3% amid an eight-day stretch in which in has gained seven days.</p><p>Here are Bagri's potential positive stock catalysts:</p><p>* Renewal of federal tax credit eligibility, under the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers tax rebates for buying new and used electric vehicles.</p><p>* A potential upgrade of Tesla's credit rating to investment grade status by the end of the year. S&amp;P Global Ratings currently rates Tesla credit at BB+, which is the highest speculative grade, or \"junk\" rating, and just one notch below investment grade.</p><p>* The first deliveries of the Cybertruck in 2023.</p><p>* Expansion of the EV charging network and improved utilization.</p><p>* Gross margin improvement, driven by 4680 cells.</p><p>Bagri said he believes Tesla could achieve about 10% global market share of passenger vehicles, as global battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption is expected to reach 40% by the end of 2023. His market share estimate assumes the company can maintain a market share in China in the \"high-single digit\" percentage range.</p><p>Of the 42 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover Tesla, only four are now bearish after Needham's upgrade, while 27 are bullish and 11 are neutral.</p><p>The upgrade comes after a report showing that after more than two years, Tesla no longer holds the title of the most bearish bets on the stock. Short interest in Tesla was $17.4 billion as of Wednesday, according to S3 Partners, while Apple Inc.'s stock AAPL became the most shorted with short interest of $18.4 billion.</p><p>Don't miss: Tesla spent 864 days as Wall Street's biggest short bet. Now it's Apple.</p><p>Separately, Tesla was hit with a new lawsuit, that alleges the EV maker \"deceptively and misleadingly\" overstated the abilities of its Autopilot and Full Self Driving features.</p><p>Tesla's stock has dropped 13.1% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has shed 17.1%.</p><p>Tesla has one less bear after Needham upgrades, citing several reasons to expect a stock rally</p>",
