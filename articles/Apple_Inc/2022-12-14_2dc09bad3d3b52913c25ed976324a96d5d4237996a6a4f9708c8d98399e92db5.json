  "title": "Apple is seeing better iPhone wait times, but that's still 'not enough,' says analyst; Quoted shipment delays still 'push delivery dates past the all important holiday season'",
  "text": "<p>Apple AAPL is dealing with production shortfalls for the iPhone 14 Pro line as manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd., better known as Foxconn, has seen output sharply curbed by COVID-19 restrictions in China. Apple warned in early November that Foxconn's primary assembly facility was seeing \"significantly reduced\" operating capacity, though conditions seem to have gotten a bit better since then.</p><p>Vogt wrote late Tuesday that \"wait times across most markets including the U.S. and China improved relative to both last week and two weeks ago indicating the supply chain disruptions are easing on the margin.\"</p><p>But those improvements are \"not enough,\" in his view.</p><p>In China, wait times for \"high-end\" iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max devices fell to 28 days from 36 days last week, he noted. In the U.S., they're down to about 23 days from 25 days a week ago. Those delays still \"push delivery dates past the all important holiday season,\" he commented.</p><p>Vogt's note comes amid ongoing questions from analysts about how much demand Apple will be able to delay as it works through production challenges, and how much will be lost for good as consumers aren't able to receive what they want during the holidays.</p><p>\"While iPhone demand is typically durable, we lower FY23 by the 7 million units to 232 million (prior 239 million) as the duration of the disruptions are not analogous to prior demand shortfalls resulting in perishability,\" he wrote.</p><p>Vogt remains bullish on Apple's stock, with a buy rating and $180 target price.</p><p>See also: Apple planning huge change as a result of European legal push, report says</p><p>Apple shares ended Wednesday's session off 1.6%. They've declined about 19% so far this year as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has slipped roughly 7% in the same span.</p><p>Apple is seeing better iPhone wait times, but that's still 'not enough,' says analyst</p>",
