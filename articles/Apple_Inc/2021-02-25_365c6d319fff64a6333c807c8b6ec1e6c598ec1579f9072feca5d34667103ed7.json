  "text": "<p>There are times when words speak louder than actions. When Netflix <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5121f014-0db8-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745\">pulled an episode</a> of the satirical current affairs show <em>Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj</em> from its Saudi Arabian site in 2019, its justification sparked as much consternation as the act itself. Asked about the removal of the show, which criticised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and mocked the official account of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oVl3gyIaeI&amp;feature=emb_logo\">said</a>: “We're not trying to do ‘truth to power', we're trying to entertain.”&#xa0;</p> <p>At a time when Netflix's dominance has made it almost a synecdoche for streaming film and TV, Hastings' comment was seen as throwing into doubt the future of politically engaged filmmaking. In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03ac98a5-a492-4823-bc98-36f12383c34a\">interview with the FT</a> last year, he conceded that “it wasn't the best phrase I have ever used”. Netflix also released a statement saying: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request — and to comply with local law.” </p> <p>But often actions do speak louder than words. Netflix is again drawing criticism, this time for its failure to back Bryan Fogel's incendiary new documentary <em>The Dissident</em>, a daring examination of the killing of Khashoggi. With its combination of forensic insight and moving testimonies from fellow dissidents and Khashoggi's fiancée Hatice Cengiz, it is a film that truly merits that much overused accolade “must see”.</p> <p>However, despite its strength, and the fact that Fogel gave Netflix its first Oscar for a feature-length film with his previous documentary, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72c1c3a0-7833-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691\"><em>Icarus</em></a> (about Russia's sports doping programme), the streaming giant declined to acquire <em>The Dissident — </em>as did several other large media companies. Meanwhile, last November, Netflix signed an eight film deal with a Saudi studio.</p> <p>“What we've seen is that the business interests of these companies have taken precedence over human rights violations,” Fogel tells me over Zoom. “Subscriber growth and investment is what is key. The Netflix that distributed <em>Icarus</em> three years ago is a very different company to the Netflix of today.”&#xa0;</p> <p>While the streaming platform does host films tackling geopolitics, such as <em>Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom, E-Team </em>and<em> The Square,</em> almost all date from 2017 or earlier. As the company has grown and expanded across the world, its inclination to make or acquire films that address challenging issues in those places has diminished. </p> <p>“The globalisation of content means that more and more, stories such as <em>The Dissident </em>are going to have a hard time to be globally distributed,” Fogel says. “I think there's much to be concerned about if you're a film-maker such as myself right now.”</p> <p>It is a sentiment echoed by the Chinese artist, activist and documentarist Ai Weiwei. Over email, the maker of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c843161-ffdc-4688-9acb-afbce543cc97\"><em>Coronation</em></a>, about the Covid outbreak in Wuhan<em>,</em> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34645871-d7bd-40e8-80cb-8e215991d5ce\"><em>Cockroach</em></a>, about the Hong Kong protests, tells me that he now self-releases his films, in the absence of backing from mainstream distributors. “I have tried almost every major avenue, including international film festivals, Netflix, Amazon and Imax theatres. Basically, I have been refused by them all without being given a clear reason.”</p> <p>For Ai, the reasons are transparent. “The film industry relies so heavily on Chinese investment and access to the Chinese market . . . Any company with business in China accepts censorship from that regime.” And he fears that this risk-averse attitude towards political film-making will discourage new dissenting voices. “The message that has been sent is clear: you cannot survive if you question power.”</p> <p>Fogel and Ai's comments are in stark contrast to the widely held belief that we are living through a “golden age of documentary”. While the growing popularity of non-fiction work in recent years is undeniable, it has primarily been driven by films and docu-series whose main strength is easy consumability rather than investigative depth. “Everything has become entertainment,” Ai says. “It is a symptom of capitalism and the ‘winner take all' mentality that proliferates in society, the desire to extract more profit from the audience through any means necessary. This is a death spiral.”&#xa0;</p> <p>While this view perhaps overlooks recent Netflix and Amazon documentaries that have tackled issues such as race, disability and the internet, none risk rocking the boat in international markets, and the most discussed and watched titles of the past few years — such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2b40042-74c3-11ea-ad98-044200cb277f\"><em>Tiger King</em></a> (circa 64m views)<em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f001260e-a02a-11ea-b65d-489c67b0d85d\"><em>The Last Dance</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ded6d7e0-18cf-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21\"><em>Fyre Festival</em></a> — all put a premium on entertainment, star power or cult appeal. They may be well-made and watchable, but they are unlikely to change the world.</p> <p>The success of these titles, coupled with the voracious appetite of viewers for new yet similar content, means the all-you-can-eat buffet must constantly be replenished. And for directors such as the Venice Golden Lion-winning Gianfranco Rosi, this formula-driven, mass-production approach poses an existential threat for the kinds of films he makes.&#xa0;</p> <p>His latest film, <em>Notturno</em>, is a spellbinding collage of unhurried and intimate footage acquired over years — in this instance of soldiers, refugees, terrorists, doctors and others caught up in the conflicts across the Middle East. As with his much-garlanded 2016 feature <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb0e3802-2e2d-11e6-bf8d-26294ad519fc\"><em>Fire at Sea</em></a>, there is no guiding narration, no talking heads, not even chyrons to provide context.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is the kind of film that “could never be produced by Netflix, Amazon, HBO etc,” he tells me. “They want a story quickly, a 50-page script [turned into] a film. But the moment you write a script you start with a lie. For me a film is a journey. Sometimes I wait three years for something to happen.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Indeed, for all the financial muscle they have, Rosi laments how little time and freedom today's platforms afford their filmmakers. “A deadline is one of the main problems for a documentary,” he says. “You have to trust the director, to create auteurs, otherwise Netflix films risk becoming like commercials — about the brand, not the director's voice.”</p> <p><em>Notturno</em> will be released by Mubi, but in recent months new platforms exclusively devoted to documentary have emerged that offer an alternative to the streaming behemoths. One such, True Story, launched in October, promising “the kind of beautiful and challenging pieces of documentary filmmaking that are harder to find elsewhere”. And in December, the UK's leading documentary distributor Dogwoof created an “on demand” service. Alongside an array of biographies, crime investigations and stranger-than-fiction tales, it hosts hard-hitting films such as the recent fly-on-the-wall account of a Wuhan Covid ward <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f339ead-2d6d-432a-819c-6f1715c150f0\"><em>76 Days</em></a><em>,</em> and last year's coruscating exposé of corruption in the Romanian healthcare system, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bb450f4-896a-40ca-b2a7-4bde1abf436b\"><em>Collective</em></a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>CEO Anna Godas explains over email that Dogwoof's approach is defined by its freedom and commitment to distribute films that “may not bring huge commercial success but contribute to strengthening [the company] and [giving] a deeper meaning to what we do.”</p> <p>While it would be naive to suggest that a company the size of Netflix could follow the same business model as an independent specialist, the approach of Dogwoof and others serves to show that speaking truth to power and delivering crowd-pleasing entertainment needn't be a binary choice. </p> <p>And if streaming platforms are to continue to attenuate the influence of public broadcasting — still a leading subsidiser of political documentaries in many countries — it seems incumbent on them as the world's leading streaming service to inform their viewers about pressing global issues. The alternative is what Ai Weiwei calls, with considerable understatement, “unexciting prospects for the future” of documentary.</p> <p><em>‘Notturno' is released on Mubi on March 5; ‘The Dissident' is screening at the Glasgow Film Festival on March 6 and will be released in the next few months </em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
