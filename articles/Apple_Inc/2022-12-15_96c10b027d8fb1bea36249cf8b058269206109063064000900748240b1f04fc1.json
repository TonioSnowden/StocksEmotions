  "title": "Beijing's Pivot to Growth Comes Very Late; China's leaders are finally sending stronger signals on reigniting growth, but some damage already done may be irreparable",
  "text": "<p>November data released Thursday painted a picture of an economy already in deep distress: retail sales slid 5.9% from a year earlier, investment growth slowed, and industrial production rose just 2.2%—less than half of October's 5% rise. And while the abrupt loosening of China's \"zero-covid\" controls will eventually support growth, the nation will now also have to contend with the collateral damage of reopening. That could include not only widespread illness and frightened consumers but, potentially, more political instability if the toll from the exit wave grows too large.</p><p>Given such a backdrop, it is unsurprising to see China's leadership finally sounding a much clearer pro-growth tone.</p><p>Last week's Politburo meeting statement was notable for omitting the longstanding catchphrase \"housing is for living in, not for speculation\"—the first time a Politburo readout had not included it since 2020, according to Morgan Stanley. Bloomberg reports that the Central Economic Work Conference, which is reportedly under way and which sets the general policy direction for the coming year, may declare that the \"deleveraging\" of the housing sector has been successfully completed.</p><p>Such rhetorical contortions might seem abstract, but they are important because they send signals to Communist Party cadres lower down the totem pole, giving them political cover to, for example, consider further easing down-payment requirements or other housing-related restrictions in their local markets.</p><p>This signaling, in combination with Beijing's recent moves to widen financing channels for property developers, can actually be quite powerful. If there was any good news from Thursday's data release, it was on the housing market: prices across 70 cities fell by an average of 0.25% in November, but that was the smallest fall since July. And despite tepid overall growth in credit, there are signs that mortgage lending may be starting to recover. Goldman Sachs estimates that medium and long-term loans to households grew 4.8% in November on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis—up from 3.4% in October. China's housing market is still in dire straits, but a partial rebound by the second half of next year is starting to look more plausible.</p><p>But even assuming that a housing market and consumption recovery materializes, much of the damage of the past three years is likely to persist. Lost income and lost time for young people risk some permanent scarring of the labor market and future consumption—particularly since several key industries that absorbed educated young graduates before 2020, including internet technology and education, are unlikely to fully recover.</p><p>More broadly, signs that both many ordinary Chinese and multinational companies are losing some confidence in China's direction—evidenced by the recent protests and Apple's accelerated diversification plans—could have pernicious long-term effects. Those could include an accelerated shift of manufacturing investment toward India, Southeast Asia and Mexico, or a brain drain once China's borders fully reopen.</p><p>A more growth-oriented and practical Chinese leadership, if indeed it has returned, would be welcome news for the whole world. But people inside and outside of China have been given many reasons to remain skeptical.</p><p>Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com</p><p>Beijing's Pivot to Growth Comes Very Late</p>",
