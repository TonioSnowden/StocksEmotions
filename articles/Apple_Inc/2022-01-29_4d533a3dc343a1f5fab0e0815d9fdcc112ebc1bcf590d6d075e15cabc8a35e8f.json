  "text": "<p>\n  Some regret their exuberance. Others value the lessons they learned. Still others are convinced big profits lie ahead. </p><p>\n  We checked in with some of the investors who went all-in on so-called meme stocks during the pandemic to see how they are adjusting as the market deals with a new round of turbulence. </p><p>\n  One thing's for sure: 2022's volatile stock market isn't the same rising tide that pulled in millions of amateur investors over the past two years. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  In it for the long haul </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Joanna Burns is playing the long game. </p><p>\n  The Ventura County, Calif., resident became interested in investing last January when Reddit's WallStreetBets forum shot to prominence. She made her bet on AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. </p><p>\n  Now Ms. Burns is holding her stock, believing the shares are undervalued and will rocket higher when the price begins to rise and short sellers -- those betting against the AMC stock -- buy shares to cut their losses. She said she is sitting on a profit after initially buying shares at about $13 and adding to that position at higher and lower prices. AMC shares closed Friday at $15.06. </p><p>\n  If the shares do rise as she expects, Ms. Burns would like to use profits to pay off student loans and buy a home. </p><p>\n  But she sees her shareholding in AMC as more than an investment: To her, it's part of a David-versus-Goliath battle between powerful financial institutions and everyday retail investors. </p><p>\n  \"It's really capitalizing on this opportunity to gain financial freedom as well as to finally win in a rigged game,\" she said. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, she is earning her living in the gig economy -- writing, copy-editing, making videos for a CBD company, giving tarot readings -- after finding that the corporate world wasn't the best fit. </p><p>\n  \"With Covid, it allowed a lot of introspection,\" she said. \"I've decided to just step out of I guess what you would call a rat race.\" </p><p>\n  -- Karen Langley </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Done with the meme scene </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Sam Daftarian has called it quits on trading meme stocks. </p><p>\n  \"The whole meme-stock saga -- it's not a sustainable way of trading,\" Mr. Daftarian said. </p><p>\n  Last year, he relished trading and scored some profits riding the viral stock sensations. Mr. Daftarian, 45, even pondered making a full-time job out of it. </p><p>\n  Since then, he's decided it isn't for him. One turning point? When he got burned on an investment in the e-commerce company ContextLogic Inc. After hearing about the stock from his cousin, he poured thousands of dollars into the shares starting in June. The price tumbled after, and he says he sold out of the investment with a steep loss. </p><p>\n  \"That was the one that made me realize, 'Hey, all your gains on GME and AMC were probably just luck,'\" Mr. Daftarian said, using the tickers for GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment. \"They weren't based in fundamentals and research. It was based on emotions and sentiment.\" </p><p>\n  He says he wishes he hadn't sold out of tech behemoths like Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. in favor of meme stocks. He's also dabbled in cryptocurrencies, but recently cashed out of a position in dogecoin. </p><p>\n  \"If I've learned anything, it's that buying and holding is the smartest thing to do,\" Mr. Daftarian said. </p><p>\n  -- Gunjan Banerji </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Still a believer </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Thushira Kumarage has never been to a GameStop retail location. He lives in Edinburgh, Scotland -- where the closest store is located across the Irish Sea, hundreds of miles away. </p><p>\n  But Mr. Kumarage has still become a devoted GameStop investor. Last year, the 21-year-old student studying math, statistics and actuarial science started scooping up shares based on a tip from a WhatsApp trading group. He managed to buy in January 2021 just before shares soared as high as $483. And he kept scooping up more throughout the spring. He currently holds 180 shares -- an amount he hasn't added to or subtracted from since May. </p><p>\n  He's had a strong stomach as the stock has zigzagged. His gains have fluctuated by tens of thousands of dollars, and he's currently sitting on a modest profit. He doesn't plan on selling. </p><p>\n  \"I think that investing for a short squeeze is different from seeing the long-term potential of this company,\" he said. He puts himself in the latter camp. </p><p>\n  Mr. Kumarage said he remains optimistic about GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen's vision and was encouraged last year when former Amazon.com Inc. executives Matt Furlong and Mike Recupero joined as chief executive and chief financial officer, respectively. </p><p>\n  \"Why would they jump ship from a successful company to a company that is supposedly dying and supposedly going out of business?\" he asked. </p><p>\n  -- Caitlin McCabe </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Converting a skeptic </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  In the Misener household, Shari calls the financial shots. The elementary-school teacher, 51, keeps a careful watch on expenses and closely inspects bank statements and receipts. Her husband, Robert, says he would \"never write a check without running it by her first.\" </p><p>\n  But when it comes to GameStop, Robert is the one in the driver's seat. </p><p>\n  Together, the couple owns 198 shares of GameStop stock in brokerage accounts that Mr. Misener controls. He's added to the position steadily over the past year, buying as recently as November. </p><p>\n  \"I feel good about the company,\" said the 51-year-old Florida resident, who is a manager at a technology-services company. </p><p>\n  He said he's even made his wife more of a believer in the stock, too. </p><p>\n  \"She checks the stock price a couple times a week and if it has a down day and it happened to be a day that she checked it, she'll kind of rib me a little bit. She'll be like 'Oh, so where are we today?'\" Mr. Misener said. </p><p>\n  \"She probably has hope, or maybe guarded optimism.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Misener said he trusts in Mr. Cohen, who co-founded pets-product retailer Chewy Inc. before wresting control of GameStop. </p><p>\n  For now, he doesn't see himself selling, he said, and believes the stock could ultimately vault past last year's high of $483. Recent volatility in the shares hasn't shaken Mr. Misener. </p><p>\n  \"It's kind of a faith thing. I just trust that based on his experience with Chewy . . . that he and his team are doing the right thing to take the company where they want to go,\" Mr. Misener said. </p><p>\n  -- Caitlin McCabe </p><p></p>",
