  "title": "New York exodus created a ‘suburban dream on steroids'— but will it last?",
  "text": "<p>When Amit Bansal moved from Manhattan to the New York suburbs in July last year, he knew he would love the larger home, the roomy garden and — when the time came for children — the excellent local schools. What he was not prepared for was the peace and quiet.</p> <p>“Here, the only person I interact with in person all day is my wife. It's challenging for me,” says the 36-year-old venture capitalist, who works from his new home in Larchmont, a village in Westchester County, a 40-minute train ride from New York's Grand Central Station. </p> <p>“The energy of [Manhattan], the randomness you get from nearly two million people: on every block unexpected interactions, different people from different walks of life. I thrive off that kind of energy. I very much miss that.”</p> <p>In search of more space, greenery, a lower infection risk and a school system less vulnerable to Covid-triggered closures, New Yorkers like Bansal have been moving to the suburbs in droves since coronavirus struck the city in March 2020. </p> <p>But as growing demand for suburban living pushes up property prices and new arrivals confront its drawbacks — from isolation and higher property taxes to threatened commuter rail services — the boom in suburban home sales shows signs of slowing.</p> <p>And with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f64e7de-65db-4d5f-9b4b-2f0ba9a11747\">New York's vaccine programme</a> offering the prospect of a return to normal life in America's most populous city, has demand peaked for New York's suburbs?</p> <p>Data from the US postal service shows how rapid the exodus from the city was after Covid-19 hit. Between March and July it received 108,969 temporary change of address requests, according to MyMove, which the postal service employs to help with changes of address — more than six times the number received in the same period in 2019.</p> <p>A boom in suburban home sales suggests many made a permanent move: In June and July, 4,422 homes sold in the adjacent counties of Westchester and Fairfield (which is in Connecticut), up 65 per cent on the same months in 2019, according to Serhant.</p> <p>In Westchester County, the neighbourhoods of Pelham, New Rochelle and Larchmont offer the classic trappings of affluent suburban life: tennis and country clubs, golf courses and popular beaches and marinas on the Long Island Sound. </p> <p>Along Long Island's north shore, popular neighbourhoods within an 45-minute train ride of Penn Station include Port Washington and Manhasset; further east Roslyn and Oyster Bay are attracting buyers.</p> <p>Home sales have been busiest in the $600,000 to $900,000 price bracket, says Owen Berkowitz, an agent with Douglas Elliman, based in Westchester. City exiles typically seek a four-bedroom home on a quarter-acre plot. “Their own fenced property and plenty of space. [Coronavirus] has put the traditional American suburban dream on steroids.”</p> <p>Helped by the new demand, median prices gained 7 per cent in November on the year before across Westchester and Fairfield counties, according to Serhant.</p> <p>Finding New Yorkers the right home is getting harder, say agents. Sam Chandan, chair of the Schack Institute of Real Estate, part of New York University, points to sluggish construction since 2008 and the many homes standing empty in January that are now occupied. </p> <p>“There simply aren't that many homes to buy.” Since sales peaked in the summer, growth compared to last year is still high, but has slowed: the 1,164 homes sold across Westchester and Fairfield counties in November was 17 per cent up year-on-year, according to Serhant.</p> <p>High suburban property taxes are another disincentive. At $33,554, the annual property tax for a typical $1.25m detached home in Rye, near Larchmont, is more than three times the $11,064 for a typical Manhattan condo of the same price, according to Garrett Derderian, head of research at Serhant.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Covid-19 has placed in jeopardy the suburbs' easy access to the city, a pillar of their appeal. Joe Germani, 32, who bought a home in New Rochelle, near Larchmont, in October, still drives back with his wife to his old Manhattan neighbourhood in 30 minutes and will make the commute by car when his office opens again. He says living this close is “a good way to dip our toe [in the suburbs] without fully committing”.</p> <p>How close it will feel next year is uncertain. The MTA, which operates the Metro-North Railroad, the main commuter rail line supplying Westchester and Fairfield, warns that without $12bn in new federal aid commuter services will be cut by up to 50 per cent next year.</p> <p>When staff return to offices the effect will be severe crowding, especially at peak times, and longer and less predictable journey times, according to an October report by Rudin Centre for Transportation at NYU and Appleseed, a consultancy. The popular routes from affluent suburban areas will become more expensive, says the centre's Mitchell L Moss. “For Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad there will be fare increases.” </p> <p>City dwellers moving to the suburbs either have not considered this or are unrealistically hopeful for a massive federal bailout of the MTA by the incoming Biden administration, says Chandan. “They are discounting the worst-case scenarios.”</p> <p>New Yorkers relying on private suburban schools may also end up disappointed. Greens Farms Academy, a private school of 750 pupils near Southport in Fairfield County, has seen a boom in admissions from New York arrivals since May. </p> <p>Students enrolled in New York City schools comprised 15 per cent of inquiries and applications between September and November, says head of school Bob Whelan. “Typically the proportion is between 1 per cent and 3 per cent”.</p> <p>Parents report anxiety at school closures in the city and smaller campuses, which may increase the risk of infection; applications from students at local public schools are increasing for similar reasons.</p> <p>Following the 9/11 attacks — when many New Yorkers moved to their second homes and enrolled children in local private schools — not everyone was pleased with the results, says Whelan, who worked elsewhere at the time. </p> <p>“After the glow of the transition had worn off, in some cases their expectations weren't fully met,” he says, adding that many compromised, staying put to avoid the disruption of another school move.</p> <p>For now, Germani sees few compromises in his new suburban life. But when Manhattan's key benefits — the opera, concerts, and proximity to the office — are available again, this may change. </p> <p>“We may get bored of living in the ‘burbs, in which case we'll move back to Manhattan. We're in the honeymoon phase so it's hard to say exactly what would draw us back — probably what drew us out: the feeling that there is a better lifestyle.”</p> <p>Once the vaccine sees New York functioning again, many recent converts to suburban life will move back to the city, predicts Kenneth T Jackson, a history professor at Columbia University, who owns homes in both Westchester and Manhattan.</p> <p>“Sure, the suburbs have it — space, greenery and great public schools — it's just that in recent decades people don't want it,” he says. “When the city gets back on its feet, and things open — the opera, Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, the museums, theatres, cinemas — people will return.”</p> <p>&#xa0;<em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
