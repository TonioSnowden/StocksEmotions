  "text": "<p>It's a well-known phenomenon that some prisoners can come to prefer carceral surroundings to life on the outside. It's less common for that experience to be shared by their guards. But the first time we encounter supervising officer Leigh Henry (Nina Sosanya), she's snugly locked up in a cell of her own. While it leaves much to be desired in terms of comfort, furnishing and greenery — and is situated in a rough neighbourhood — it offers a convenient commute. Besides, the word on the walkways is that Leigh prefers the inmates to her colleagues. </p> <p>It's not hard to see why. The eponymous screws in Channel 4's new six-part series are a misfit group of broad, often grating character types more typically found in a workplace sitcom than a prison drama. Joining the standoffish but kind Leigh, the logorrhoea-afflicted Ali, teacherly Jackie, disengaged old-timer Don and boorish Gary, is new recruit Rose (<em>Derry Girls</em>'s Jamie-Lee O'Donnell), who may be more au fait with the criminals than her callowness suggests. </p> <p>The opening episode follows her eventful first day in the men's facility, which involves disposing of a contraband item (or rather creature) and diffusing a hostage situation that arises after apple crumble is taken off the menu. Perhaps prison food isn't such a culinary nadir after all. </p> <p>The pudding protest isn't played for laughs, but it does capture the essence of a show that is largely invested in the mundane aspects of life behind bars. A break from the tired genre of hard-hitting prison thrillers, <em>Screw</em> is refreshingly different in its muted approach, taking in events such as inmates wanting to switch rooms and open their parcels to Leigh trying to pass an inspection that could bring a promotion. </p> <p>Although there's a certain amount of levity, this isn't quite the warm and whimsical prison of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3ee8940-c496-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675\"><em>Paddington 2</em>.</a> There are times when violence threatens to erupt, and one instance in which it is reluctantly yielded to. But these instances are less about aggression than they are about vulnerability or insecurity. As Leigh says at one point, “they're not bad people, they're people who've done bad things”.</p> <p>But where Netflix's readily comparable series <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a9a2fda-a7ce-11e9-b6ee-3cdf3174eb89\"><em>Orange is the New Black</em></a> successfully proved that comedy and drama can be compatible cellmates, here the uneven and overly insistent attempts at humour can jar with scenes of sincere compassion and sensitivity. It's a screw in need of tightening in an otherwise promising show. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Channel 4 from January 6 at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Prison drama meets workplace comedy in Screw' FT.com 6 January.
