  "title": "Andrew Cuomo Faces Misdemeanor Sex Crime Complaint; Complaint alleges Cuomo forcibly touched a former executive assistant",
  "text": "<p>The Sheriff's office has been investigating Mr. Cuomo, 63 years old, since Brittany Commisso, one of Mr. Cuomo's former executive assistants, spoke with investigators in early August, the sheriff has said.</p><p>Ms. Commisso said Mr. Cuomo reached under her shirt and groped her breast during a 2020 encounter at the state Executive Mansion in Albany. The former Democratic governor and his attorney have repeatedly denied her allegation.</p><p>Albany County District Attorney P. David Soares said he was surprised to learn that the complaint had been filed and declined to comment further on the matter. Brian Premo, an attorney for Ms. Commisso, said his client was also surprised by the filing but would continue to cooperate with the investigation.</p><p>\"It was my client's understanding that the District Attorney's office would conduct a thorough apolitical investigation into the matter and then discuss all relevant issues with my client before any decision was made about whether a criminal action would be commenced only after she gave her informed consent,\" Mr. Premo said in a statement.</p><p>An attorney for Mr. Cuomo, Rita Glavin, said, \"Gov. Cuomo has never assaulted anyone, and Sheriff Apple's motives here are patently improper. Sheriff Apple didn't even tell the District Attorney what he was doing.\"</p><p>Mr. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on the statement.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo resigned from office on Aug. 24 in the wake of the allegations by Ms. Commisso and 10 other women that were detailed in a report by state Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo allegedly groped Ms. Commisso's left breast on Dec. 7, 2020, on the second floor of the Executive Mansion, according to the complaint filed Thursday. The charge is based on testimony taken by the attorney general's office as well as cellphone records from Ms. Commisso and Mr. Cuomo, according to the complaint.</p><p>The crime of forcible touching is a class A misdemeanor. If convicted, Mr. Cuomo could face up to a year in jail.</p><p>With many misdemeanors, a person is given a summons with a notice to appear in court on a future date, said Paul DerOhannesian, an Albany-based attorney. At that point, the person would be arraigned on the criminal charges.</p><p>Ms. James said in a statement that the criminal charge validated the findings in her report, which Mr. Cuomo has said was politically motivated. Ms. James has told union leaders in recent days that she will seek the Democratic nomination for governor.</p><p>Ms. James will challenge Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was Mr. Cuomo's lieutenant and assumed office after he stepped down.</p><p>The Democrat-controlled state Assembly's judiciary committee has also been investigating Mr. Cuomo in preparation for possible impeachment. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, said last week that a report on the committee's investigation was in its final stages.</p><p>Deanna Paul contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com</p><p>Andrew Cuomo Faces Misdemeanor Sex Crime Complaint</p>",
