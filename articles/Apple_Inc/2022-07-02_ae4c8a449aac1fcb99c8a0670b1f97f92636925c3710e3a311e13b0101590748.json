  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Gear & Gadgets -- That's Debatable:  Is Grammarly -- the Digital Proofreader -- Making Us Better Writers?  ----  By Christopher Castano",
  "text": "<p>\n  YES: No proofreading tool is perfect -- we all have stories of how Apple's autocorrect has twisted our words at inopportune moments. But fans of Grammarly say it offers mostly helpful suggestions on improving your writing. Even without paying for the $30-a-month premium service, you can download the software to your browser or desktop and immediately access its punctuation, grammar and phrasing suggestions wherever you are typing, be that in an email, a job application portal, an essay on Google Docs or a tweet. </p><p>\n  Having that second line of defense against typos has made Grammarly invaluable for some professionals. \"I trust it more than I trust my . . . own checking,\" said Joannah Pickett, 47, the associate vice president of the department of Alumni Relations &amp; Development at Trinity University in San Antonio, who describes her work pace as \"harried and chaotic.\" She maintains that good grammar is paramount if one wants to be taken seriously. \"While a wrinkled shirt or some misspellings may not matter to other generations, those in leadership still care, as do many people at the heads of their industry,\" executives with whom she needs to work and negotiate. \"Proper grammar just starts you off on the right foot.\" </p><p>\n  Even professional writers and editors, particularly journalists, have adopted the tool. As their industry has gone digital, people like Gabrielle Healy, 26, a digital editor, are being asked to write and edit faster than ever before. Without the time to proofread herself, Ms. Healy started to notice that typos were slipping through the cracks. After she downloaded Grammarly, she was able to get them under control. \"I'm constantly catching errors with it. . . . I [needed] the hand.\" she said. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  NO: Zoe Burke first encountered Grammarly as an English major in college through targeted Google ads. That it not only helped fix typos and missing punctuation, but also improved style and tone made it stand out from other built-in proofreading tools. But as she continued her studies, eventually earning her master's degree in English from the University of Dayton and joining its faculty as an instructor, she noticed the software missing errors and overcorrecting. When she ran her Master's Thesis, about a composition course she was teaching, through the program, she said, \"Grammarly kept wanting to change 'composing' to 'composting.'\" </p><p>\n  Though the company promises to help people become better writers, Ms. Burke questions that claim, especially if users don't already have a firm grasp of the laws of language. \"These folks trust the program to be right, and . . . the program isn't always right,\" she said. \"You're not going to learn from Grammarly, but your writing can become more polished if you use it.\" </p><p>\n  Audio producer and podcast host Ronald Young Jr., 38, echoes that sentiment: \"Autocorrecting software keeps you from making common mistakes [but] you still have to know how to communicate effectively outside of the basics of grammar.\" </p><p>\n  A Grammarly spokeswoman said that its team is constantly working to improve the user experience. \"We humbly recognize that the product is far from perfect and that the linguistic challenges are plentiful.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Young says he wouldn't consider upgrading to Grammarly Premium, which would unlock more kinds of suggested edits, including ones that tackle formatting and repetitive language. \"With gas prices being where they are . . . I really don't need another something to subscribe to.\" </p><p></p>",
