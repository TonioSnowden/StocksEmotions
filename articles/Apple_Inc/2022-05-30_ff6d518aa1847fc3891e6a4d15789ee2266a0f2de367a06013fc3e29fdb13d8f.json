  "text": "<p>The slowing economy is squeezing the digital advertising market. That message from&#xa0;US social media group Snap hit tech stocks hard last week. But UK ad mogul Sir Martin Sorrell sees no sign of a slowdown. On Monday, his digital marketing agency&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f5907735-2eb0-4f1c-9d69-cc9096e09e6f\">S4 Capital</a> reported “frenetic” new business. Its first-quarter gross profit rose by more than a third. </p> <p>The&#xa0;London-listed&#xa0;group expects ad spending by big businesses to remain resilient. Caveats apply. Apple's software privacy changes last year clearly&#xa0;damaged Meta's business model. Moreover, clients rarely signal bad news in advance. Downturns can come as a sudden, nasty&#xa0;surprise. </p> <p>But it is reasonable to think that digital marketing expenditure will hold up&#xa0; even in a downturn. It is expanding its reach at the expense of analogue spending. S4 forecasts that US digital ads'&#xa0;share of total US ad&#xa0;spend will rise by 7 percentage points to 68 per cent by 2025. S4's other businesses, such as marketing technology software and digital transformation, are expected to grow at an even faster rate. </p> <p>That outlook is not reflected in the share price, which has fallen by two-thirds since September. Much of the decline was down to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6e9b957-8d40-461b-a1f1-4eb88a034bdd\">last-minute delay</a> in auditor PwC signing off results because of weak controls and missing documentation.</p> <p>S4's enterprise value is 10 times its ebitda, less than half the historic average. The multiple is two-thirds higher than for traditional agencies such as WPP and Publicis. But it is significantly lower than the likes of&#xa0; IT consulting company Accenture, on a multiple of 16. </p> <p>The shares have been&#xa0;beaten down to a level where they are not much use as currency. Sir Martin has pledged only to issue paper for acquisitions at&#xa0; the 425p price prevalent before the 2021 results delay, nearly a third higher than today. That will not stop deals altogether, though it will slow the pace. Los Angeles-based tech services company TheoremOne <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cb11238-c77d-49bb-bdac-52d87d7fdafc\">agreed a deal</a> on that basis two weeks ago.</p> <p>A fallow period for dealmaking would be a big change for a company that has agreed 30 takeovers in just under four years. It would be no bad thing. The company has amassed a broad enough spread of disciplines and geographies to support clients. It must now focus on getting its financial reporting up to scratch. A revival in the share price depends on this — as well as Sorrell being right about demand for advertising.</p><p>Source:  2022 'S4 Capital: Sorrell must fix accounts failings and be right on ad demand' FT.com 30 May.
