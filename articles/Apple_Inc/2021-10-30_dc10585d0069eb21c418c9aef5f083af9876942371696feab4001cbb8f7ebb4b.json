  "title": "U.S. News:  Sheriff Surprised by Timing of Cuomo Filing  ----  By Jimmy Vielkind",
  "text": "<p>   The Albany County sheriff said Friday that he was surprised a criminal summons charging former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo with forcible touching was issued so quickly, but said it shouldn't affect the case moving forward. </p><p>   Sheriff Craig Apple said at a news conference that an investigator had taken a misdemeanor complaint to the Albany City Court and that he had hoped to confer with Albany County District Attorney P. David Soares on the best way to proceed before the charges were made public Thursday. </p><p>   Both men's offices are investigating an allegation that the former Democratic governor, who resigned in August, groped one of his executive assistants last year. </p><p>   \"It kind of caught us by surprise,\" Sheriff Apple, a Democrat, said of the summons. \"Sometimes in police work with investigations, things don't go how you want them.\" </p><p>   Albany City Court Judge Holly Trexler issued a summons Thursday requiring Mr. Cuomo to appear in court on Nov. 17. Sheriff Apple said, \"We weren't expecting a five-minute turnaround\" with the document. </p><p>   The Sheriff's Office opened its probe into Mr. Cuomo after Brittany Commisso, one of Mr. Cuomo's former executive assistants, spoke with investigators in early August, the sheriff said. </p><p>   Ms. Commisso said Mr. Cuomo reached under her shirt and groped her breast during a 2020 encounter at the state Executive Mansion in Albany. The former Democratic governor and his attorney have repeatedly denied her allegation. </p><p>   Mr. Soares said Thursday that he was surprised to learn that the complaint had been filed and declined to comment further on the matter. An office spokeswoman declined to comment Friday on Sheriff Apple's statements. </p><p>   Sheriff Apple said it was normal for his office to file charges in court without conferring with prosecutors. Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the state court system, said Judge Trexler \"handled the filing of the misdemeanor complaint properly.\" </p><p>   Brian Premo, an attorney for Ms. Commisso, said his client was also surprised by the filing but would continue to cooperate with the investigation. He said his client had spoken with the district attorney's office as well as the Sheriff's Office. </p><p>   \"This is a politically charged matter,\" Mr. Premo said Friday during an interview on WGDJ-AM. \"I think it's only prudent to allow the prosecutorial authority to have a say in how the investigation is conducted and whether there's a prosecution.\" </p><p>   Mr. Cuomo's attorney, Rita Glavin, on Friday accused Sheriff Apple of filing the charge in coordination with the launch of state Attorney General Letitia James's campaign for governor. Ms. James released a report in August that substantiated claims of sexual harassment by Mr. Cuomo and eventually prompted his resignation. </p><p>   Ms. James declared her run for governor on Friday. </p><p>   Sheriff Apple's office relied on Ms. Commisso's testimony to investigators working for Ms. James's office, according to the criminal complaint. </p><p>   \"We expect clear-headed people will make better decisions going forward, but should this case move forward we are prepared to vigorously defend the governor and challenge every aspect of the specious, inconsistent and uncorroborated allegations made against him,\" Ms. Glavin said. </p><p>   Sheriff Apple said he wasn't motivated by politics and defended his investigation, which he said was based on evidence obtained with search warrants. </p><p>   \"The way it went down has nothing to do with the case. The case is a very solid case,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
