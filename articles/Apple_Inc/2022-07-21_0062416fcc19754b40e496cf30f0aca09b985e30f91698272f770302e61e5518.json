  "text": "<p>Snap announced plans to “substantially reduce” hiring and shake up its strategy as it posted bleak second-quarter results, blaming tough macroeconomic conditions but also stating it was “not satisfied with the results . . . regardless of the current headwinds”.</p> <p>The social media company lost about a quarter of its value on Thursday after posting the results, which chief executive Evan Spiegel said “do not reflect our ambition”.</p> <p>Revenues at the Los Angeles-based social media company increased 13 per cent to $1.11bn in the three months to the end of June, just shy of analysts' consensus of $1.13bn.</p> <p>Net losses widened by 178 per cent compared with the same period last year to $422mn — far greater than analyst estimates of losses of $340mn, according to data compiled by S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p> <p>The company had issued an unexpected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4a79791-cc8b-4c51-9515-f004e3d5b50e\">warning in May</a> that the pace of revenue growth would come in below its initial guidance of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, citing a rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic environment.</p> <p>Spiegel said that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d572dd54-5d95-4da2-8155-f4d58484ee3c\">Snap</a> planned to focus on product innovation, diversifying revenue and investment in its direct response advertising business in order to address the slowdown.</p> <p>In a letter to investors on Thursday, Snap said that brands were slashing digital advertising budgets due to the wider economic slowdown and inflationary pressures, as well as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69396795-f6e1-4624-95d8-121e4e5d7839\">privacy changes by Apple</a> that have made it harder to target advertising and measure the success of campaigns.</p> <p>It also said business had been hurt by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03c945b-ed5b-425b-8817-acb236f60931\">increased competition</a> as entrants such as Chinese-owned TikTok take market share.</p> <p>Daily active users rose 18 per cent to 347mn in the quarter, it said.</p> <p>Snap declined to provide expectations for third-quarter revenue or earnings, citing “uncertainties related to the operating environment”. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/03711791-2306-46a4-a5f5-1d79e57bd21d\">Social media</a> platforms — as well as other tech stocks — exploded in growth over the past two years as entertainment-starved users spent more time and money online during coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.</p> <p>However, this has turned into a deep and broad stock sell-off in recent months, forcing the biggest tech groups such as Meta and Google to pause hiring and announce other cost-cutting measures.</p> <p>Snap's shares fell about 25 per cent to $12.33 on news of its results. Other tech stocks with advertising-based business models were also hit: Facebook parent Meta fell 5 per cent in after-hours trading, while Google-owner Alphabet dropped 3 per cent.</p> <p>Snap said it intended to drive greater productivity by reducing its rate of hiring and through a “strict reprioritisation of goals and initiatives across the company”.</p> <p>Separately, it said it had authorised a stock repurchase programme of up to $500mn of its class A common stock. Snap also said that Spiegel and co-founder and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy had entered into long-term employment agreements with the company. They will serve in their respective roles until at least January 1 2027 on an annual salary of $1.</p><p>Source: Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 2022 'Snap shares plummet as advertising demand slumps' FT.com 21 July.
