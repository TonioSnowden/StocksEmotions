The plug-in hybrid Recharge model starts at $60,050.</p><p>VolvoThe Volvo S90 is an often-overlooked option in&#xa0;midsize luxury sedans. This Swedish underdog is worth serious consideration for anyone looking for a safe and practical sedan but has a budget for a premium car. It has the stellar safety scores you'd expect from a&#xa0;Volvo VLVLY, a roomy, comfortable interior, and styling that stands out in traffic.</p><p>The new base powertrain in the S90 is the B6 mild-hybrid engine with standard all-wheel drive. Compared with the T6 powertrain in the 2021 model, B6 makes a little less power and a little more torque. The mild-hybrid system improves fuel economy, making the S90 pretty efficient for a midsize luxury sedan. There's also a plug-in hybrid powertrain available that enhances both performance and efficiency.</p><p>The S90 is positioned between the more affordable options in this segment, like the&#xa0;Acura TLX&#xa0;and&#xa0;Jaguar XF, and it's cheaper than its more mainstream German rivals like the&#xa0;Mercedes-Benz E-Class&#xa0;and&#xa0;BMW XE:BMW 5 Series. It doesn't claim to have the sporty driving dynamics of a German sport sedan, but if you prioritize safety and practicality over performance, then you'll find a lot to love in the S90.</p><p>2022 Volvo S90 pricing</p><p>The 2022 Volvo S90 has a starting price of $51,850 for the B6 AWD Momentum model. The sporty R-Design trim and the luxurious Inscription model both start at $54,950. The plug-in hybrid Recharge model starts at $60,050 for both of its trims, R-Design and Inscription. Depending on where you live, that price can go down with federal and state incentives for electric cars.</p><p>A destination charge of $1,045 applies to all S90 models.</p><p>The Volvo S90 is priced around the middle of the midsize luxury sedan segment. It's more expensive than the&#xa0;Acura TLX,&#xa0;Jaguar XF, and&#xa0;Cadillac CT5, but it has a lower starting price than the&#xa0;BMW 5 Series,&#xa0;Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and&#xa0;Audi A6.</p><p>Driving the 2022 Volvo S90</p><p>The Volvo S90 is a luxury sedan that prioritizes comfort over performance, but it's still pretty fun to drive. It doesn't quite have the driving dynamics of many of its German rivals like the&#xa0;BMW 5 Series&#xa0;or&#xa0;Audi A6, but this Volvo is more of a sport sedan than you might expect.</p><p>The new base powertrain in the S90 is the B6 engine, which is a “twin-charged” (turbocharged and supercharged) mild-hybrid 4-cylinder engine. With just under 300 horsepower, it's pretty muscular for a base engine in this class. The 48V mild-hybrid system does its part to contribute to its impressive fuel economy rating, returning up to 31 mpg on the highway. And that's with standard all-wheel drive.</p><p>The other powertrain option is the T8 eAWD setup in the Recharge models. This improves both performance and efficiency with 400 horsepower and a 63 MPGe rating. Even with a drained hybrid battery, it achieves 30 mpg in mixed driving. The S90 Recharge has an all-electric range of 21 miles.</p><p>On top of its engaging driving dynamics, the S90 is smooth, comfortable, and quiet with both powertrain options. It gets more comfortable when you opt for the available adaptive air suspension system.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>The interior of the Volvo S90 is fitting for a luxury sedan. The design is handsome, the materials are upscale, and these are some of the most comfortable seats you'll find in any luxury car. It gets even nicer in the upper trims, especially the Inscription model, which has Nappa leather seats, Harman Kardon premium audio, and more.</p><p>An available Lounge Package makes the back seats of the S90 feel like a true flagship luxury sedan. On top of heated and cooled back seats and a luxury rear armrest, it adds massaging front seats.</p><p>The S90 benefits from roomy headroom and legroom in both rows of seats, making it a good family sedan. The trunk, however, is small for a car this size.</p><p>Also see: Keeping these things in your car will prepare you for almost any emergency</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The styling of the Volvo S90 strikes a nice balance of Volvo tradition and a modern luxury car. It has a unique light signature that doesn't look quite like any other luxury brand, and it has stylish wheel designs, but the palette of available paint colors is limited to neutral shades of black, white, and gray.</p><p>The look of the S90 changes a little depending on the trim. The sporty R-Design model includes a unique front grille, high-gloss black exterior trim, and special 19-inch wheels. The more luxury-oriented Inscription model adds more chrome to the exterior and some unique wheels of its own.</p><p>The Volvo S90 is on the bigger side of midsize luxury sedans, but it's not quite big enough to be considered full-size. It's bigger than the&#xa0;BMW 5 Series,&#xa0;Mercedes-Benz E-Class,&#xa0;Audi A6, and most other luxury sedans in this class.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Recharge plug-in hybridThe plug-in hybrid variant of the Volvo S90 produces 400 horsepower and travels up to 21 miles on electricity alone.</p><p>Lounge packageThe available Lounge package makes the S90 a more luxurious sedan with massaging front seats, heated and cooled back seats, and a luxury rear armrest.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>The base B6 AWD Momentum trim comes pretty well-equipped. Standard features include LED headlights, a panoramic sunroof, 18-inch alloy wheels, leather seats, a memory driver's seat, heated front seats, a dual-zone automatic climate control, a wireless charging pad, one-touch power-folding back seats, and auto-dimming mirrors.</p><p>Standard safety features in the S90 include a blind-spot information system with steering assist and cross-traffic alert with Autobrake, run-off road protection, and lane-keeping aid. The standard infotainment system is a 9-inch screen with Android Auto, Apple AAPL CarPlay, and Google GOOGL Maps.</p><p>Also read: Lower price and higher-range EV added to Polestar lineup</p><p>Factory options</p><p>There are two trims available above the base Momentum trim. There's an R-Design trim that adds a sportier appearance and more premium features, and there's a more luxurious Inscription trim. These two upper trims have the same starting price.</p><p>R-Design adds a unique grille, high-gloss black exterior trim, and unique seats and wheels. Inscription uses more chrome and adds perforated Nappa Leather seats, ventilated front seats, and unique wheels of its own. Both trims have Harman Kardon premium audio.</p><p>An available Advance Package adds a power trunk lid, a head-up display, and a 360-degree camera. A Climate Package adds heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel. Finally, the Lounge Package makes the back seats more luxurious with ventilated rear seats and a luxury rear armrest, plus you get massaging front seats.</p><p>A few individual options available for the S90 include Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio, adaptive air suspension, and a few different wheel options.</p><p>The Recharge plug-in hybrid models are only available in the R-Design and Inscription trims. Features and options are very similar to the B6 models.</p><p>Plus: Watch: Toddler interrupts New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern's livestream: ‘Well, that was a bedtime fail'</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>The new base engine in the Volvo S90 is a mild-hybrid 2.0-liter inline-4 with a turbocharger and an electric supercharger. Its performance numbers are pretty impressive for a base engine, and it's pretty fuel-efficient for a luxury sedan this size with standard all-wheel drive.</p><p>An optional plug-in hybrid powertrain adds a significant boost in power and torque over the base engine. It can go up to 21 miles on electricity alone, and even after the battery is depleted, it returns good fuel economy.</p><p>Every 2022 S90 uses an 8-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p><p>2.0-liter turbocharged &amp; supercharged mild-hybrid inline-4 (B6)295 horsepower @ 5,400 rpm310 lb-ft of torque @ 2,100-4,800 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/31 mpg</p><p>2.0-liter turbocharged &amp; supercharged plug-in hybrid inline-4 (Recharge)400 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm472 lb-ft of torque @ 5,400 rpmAll-electric range: 21 milesCombined EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30 mpg, 63 MPGe</p><p>FAQs</p><p>How much is a 2022 Volvo S90?</p><p>The Volvo S90 starts at $51,850 for the B6 model and $60,050 for the plug-in hybrid Recharge model.</p><p>Is the 2022 Volvo S90 reliable?</p><p>The Volvo S90 earns reliability ratings that are about average for a midsize luxury sedan.</p><p>How long do 2022 Volvo S90s last?</p><p>Since the T8 plug-in hybrid powertrain and the B6 mild-hybrid engine are relatively new in the Volvo S90, it's hard to predict how long the 2022 models will last.
