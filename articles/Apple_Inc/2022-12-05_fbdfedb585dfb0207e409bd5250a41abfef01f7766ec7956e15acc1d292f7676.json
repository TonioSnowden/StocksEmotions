  "text": "<p>   ATLANTA -- Georgia voters have suffered through an extra dose of political ads because of Tuesday's U.S. Senate runoff, and their pain has meant extra profit for WSB-TV, the station that has seen more money pass through it in 2022 than any other in the nation. </p><p>   More than $86 million in political advertising flowed into the ABC affiliate so far this year, according to data from the ad tracker AdImpact. It is a windfall generated by a confluence of high-profile races for governor and U.S. Senate, including the bonus of the runoff between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. \"Not only did they have multiple competitive races, but then they got a whole extra bite at the apple\" with the runoff race, said Ken Goldstein, a polling and political analyst. </p><p>   Over a period that includes the 2021 and 2022 runoffs, from Jan. 1, 2020, through Nov. 28, 2022, WSB-TV took in close to $232 million in political advertising, again significantly more than any station in the nation, AdImpact data shows. WSB-TV is the flagship television property of Atlanta-based Cox Media Group, which owns TV and radio stations in several states. </p><p>   Among the five largest-grossing TV stations for political ads during the multiyear period, three came from Atlanta, according to AdImpact. The other two were in Phoenix and Detroit. For 2022, the second-highest recipient is the NBC affiliate KSNV-TV in Las Vegas, which attracted $59.7 million, AdImpact data shows. </p><p>   Nationwide, AdImpact said about $8.9 billion has been spent so far by candidates and outside groups trying to influence local, state and federal elections. That compares with about $4 billion in the 2018 midterm cycle and about $9 billion in the 2020 presidential cycle. </p><p>   The largess from the campaigns has crowded out many regular businesses trying to advertise in Georgia, while also driving up costs, said Brian Easter, co-founder of the Nebo Agency, an Atlanta-based advertising firm. </p><p>   Mr. Easter said that in this year's general election, the senate campaigns pushed prices for television spots and digital spending to historic highs in Georgia. </p><p>   Georgia voters on both sides of the political aisle expressed exasperation at the deluge of advertising, much of it negative, on their TV sets, smartphones and laptops. </p><p>   Antimo Ponticello, 38, who works in Georgia's growing television and film industry, voted at an early-voting station in heavily Democratic Atlanta recently. \"I know who I am going to vote for,\" said Mr. Ponticello. \"It is a waste of money. It is just noise.\" </p><p>   Ginger Rhea, 46, who voted early for Mr. Walker in Dallas, Ga., northwest of Atlanta, said the ads interrupted her evening TV viewing.\"We watch 'Jeopardy' and look forward to it, and all that ruined it,\" she said. </p><p></p>",
