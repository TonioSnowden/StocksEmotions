  "title": "China's Top Two Leaders Diverge in Messaging on Covid Impact; Premier Li Keqiang acknowledges business impact of lockdowns and touts vaccinations in meetings with foreign executives, marking a contrast with President Xi Jinping",
  "text": "<p>Speaking to a group of senior representatives for American, European and Asian multinationals operating in China, Mr. Li said China is \"committed to striking a balance\" between reviving the economy and containing repeated Covid-19 outbreaks, said people who attended the meeting with Mr. Li, held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.</p><p>Of particular note, some participants said, Mr. Li didn't defend Mr. Xi's zero-Covid strategy, in a departure from recent meetings that foreign executives have had with senior Chinese officials, including some involved in trade and commerce.</p><p>Instead, in response to foreign executives' recommendation that China vaccinate more of its population, especially the elderly, Mr. Li said, according to participants: \"I hear your message about vaccines, and we will expand vaccination coverage.\"</p><p>\"We can't have companies stopping their operations,\" the premier added.</p><p>China's adherence to Mr. Xi's zero-Covid policy has resulted in a combination of lockdowns, mass testing and quarantines. That has crushed business activityâ€”and made it harder to vaccinate the public, especially China's large elderly population, a weakness in the country's Covid-19 defenses that health officials have publicly acknowledged. During much of the two-month-long lockdown of Shanghai, an economic hub of more than 25 million people, most vaccination centers and programs were suspended.</p><p>As of mid-March, just 51% of Chinese people over 80 had received two Covid-19 vaccine doses, compared with roughly 88% for the overall population.</p><p>While Mr. Xi has talked about the need to enhance global cooperation on vaccine development, he hasn't publicly emphasized the importance of vaccinating China's population.</p><p>Mr. Li's remarks don't openly challenge Mr. Xi's approach to the pandemic. But the comments exposed what government officials and policy advisers describe as simmering tensions among top Communist Party officials over Mr. Xi's commitment to his zero-Covid strategy.</p><p>\"Li clearly wants a different focus,\" said one of the participants in the May 19 meeting with the premier.</p><p>The State Council Information Office, which handles press inquiries for senior leaders, didn't respond to questions.</p><p>It couldn't be determined if Mr. Li, the long-sidelined premier whose political leverage is enjoying a late renaissance of sorts, could push for any meaningful changes in China's Covid strategy.</p><p>Mr. Xi appeared mindful of the cost of China's Covid lockdowns earlier this year and sought to give Shanghai some leeway to tackle local outbreaks without shutting down the entire city, people familiar with the matter have said. But he reaffirmed the zero-tolerance policy at a leadership meeting in early May as the highly transmissible Omicron variant spread across the country.</p><p>After nearly a month of Shanghai's lockdown, the head of China's National Health Commission, in a front-page article in the Communist Party-run Study Times, credited Mr. Xi with having \"personally commanded\" China's Covid-19 plan.</p><p>The zero-Covid approach proved effective at both containing outbreaks and getting the economy humming again earlier in the pandemic, underpinning Mr. Xi's view that China has managed the virus better than the West. Changing policy would be politically untenable for the top leader, government officials and advisers say, in a year when he is seeking a tradition-breaking third term in power.</p><p>As a major Communist Party conclave set for later this year draws closer, where a new slate of leadership will be unveiled, \"competition over the future direction of China's Covid response has intensified,\" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p>In his video meeting with the foreign executives, Mr. Xi gave no indication of changing the current zero-Covid policy, and the executives weren't invited to ask him questions.</p><p>\"The pandemic that has been going on unabated is posing a serious threat to the life and health of the people, and taking a heavy toll on the world economy,\" Mr. Xi said, according to China's Foreign Ministry. Some participants said his comments seemed detached from the fact that many Western economies have bounced back from the pandemic relatively well and that China's economy is now facing some of the greatest pressure.</p><p>Since the outbreak of Omicron in Shanghai and other parts of China this year, China's economy has slowed dramatically, causing widespread public frustration and prompting some foreign companies to reconsider their investments in China.</p><p>Apple Inc., for example, has told outside contractors it wants to boost production outside China, citing Beijing's Covid approach as one reason, people involved in those discussions have said.</p><p>Industry groups representing Western firms in China have stepped up their calls for Beijing to change its pandemic policies, saying longstanding curbs on travel and other restrictions are hurting profits, thwarting investment and causing an exodus of foreign executives.</p><p>As many as 23% of European businesses are considering moving their operations out of China, the highest proportion in a decade, according to a survey released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in early May. The chamber has urged authorities to shift their Covid-control strategy from lockdowns to vaccination.</p><p>\"The world is not waiting for China,\" Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU chamber, said in an interview.</p><p>Meanwhile, a survey published by the American Chamber of Commerce in China this month shows that more than 50% of American businesses have either delayed or decreased their investments in China due to recent outbreaks and repeated lockdowns.</p><p>U.S. investment in China had already plateaued in the past decade, hovering between $13 billion and $16 billion a year, as China's growth slowed and economic reform stalled, according to a 2021 study by the Atlantic Council and Rhodium Group.</p><p>Mr. Li's message to the foreign business community also comes as he tries to exert greater control over the management of China's economy as his term as premier nears its end. In recent months, he has helped dial back some of Mr. Xi's measures that steered China away from Western-style capitalism and contributed to the slowdown, while trying influence the decision on who his successor will be.</p><p>Mr. Li's remarks to the foreign executives were made during a meeting marking the 70th anniversary of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a government-backed trade body.</p><p>Throughout the meeting, which lasted 1.5 hours, Mr. Li didn't mention Mr. Xi's zero-Covid policy once, said participants. As soon as he walked into the meeting room at Diaoyutai, he took his mask off. And after he ended the meeting and talked to participants on his way out, his staff reminded him to put the mask back on.</p><p>Some participants in the meeting said Mr. Li's seeming disregard of Beijing's strict mask-wearing protocols was noteworthy.</p><p>Mr. Li appeared concerned when foreign business representatives talked about how China's Covid strategy is leaving the country increasingly isolated, took notes and told the attendees to tell their governments that China is closely listening to the issues raised.</p><p>\"This is a special moment, and a difficult moment,\" he said at the meeting, according to participants.</p><p>Write to Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.com and Brian Spegele at brian.spegele@wsj.com</p><p>China's Top Two Leaders Diverge in Messaging on Covid Impact</p>",
