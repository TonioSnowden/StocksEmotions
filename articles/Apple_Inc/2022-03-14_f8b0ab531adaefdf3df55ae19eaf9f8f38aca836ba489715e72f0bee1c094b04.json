  "title": "Lockdowns Spread Across China as Race to Contain Covid-19 Outbreak Intensifies; Authorities impose anti-Covid restrictions on Jilin province, while businesses and daily life shut down in Shenzhen and Shanghai",
  "text": "<p>Whether authorities can swiftly end the outbreak will not only test China's pandemic strategies against the more infectious Omicron variant behind the latest wave, but also has major implications for the rest of the world. China's current restrictions have already disrupted global supply chains, including Foxconn Technology Group plants in Shenzhen that make devices for Apple Inc.</p><p>Foxconn produces some iPhones as well as iPads and computers in Shenzhen. The company said it would shift work to plants in unaffected areas of China to maintain production. Shenzhen's Yantian port, one of the world's busiest container terminals, remained operational, though one company said factory shutdowns and roadblocks between warehouses and the port could see shipments drop dramatically.</p><p>Beijing has stuck to the \"zero Covid\" strategy it implemented soon after the first outbreak, relying on stringent border controls and rapid lockdowns and testing whenever a flare-up occurs. As a result, much of the country has enjoyed relatively limited disruptions to daily life throughout the pandemic.</p><p>China's latest wave of infections comes amid a coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong, a Chinese city that has a different governance system. Hong Kong has been criticized for not acting more quickly to contain the virus and has since late December recorded more than 700,000 cases and the world's highest death rate, mostly among a group of unvaccinated elderly residents.</p><p>Zhao Yueling contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com</p><p>Lockdowns Spread Across China as Race to Contain Covid-19 Outbreak Intensifies</p>",
