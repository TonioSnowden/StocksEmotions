  "title": "Fanatics' Upstart Sports-Gambling Division Hires Marketing Chief; Jason White, veteran of MTV and Beats, is joining the newest business in Michael Rubin's digital sports empire as it aims to take on big names including DraftKings and FanDuel",
  "text": "<p>Fanatics Betting and Gaming isn't operational yet. Mr. White is joining Fanatics after serving as CMO of MTV Entertainment, a unit of Paramount Global, for about a year. He previously led marketing for cannabis distributor Curaleaf Holdings Inc. and Apple Inc.-owned audio company Beats Electronics LLC.</p><p>The sports-gambling industry is dominated by companies including DraftKings Inc. and Flutter Entertainment PLC's FanDuel, which have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing but recently scaled back spending under pressure to achieve profitability.</p><p>Fanatics sees opportunity in an industry that struggles with high customer-acquisition costs and low customer loyalty, Mr. White said. Fanatics Commerce and Fanatics Collectibles, the company's two other business divisions, will use data about millions of existing customers, such as their favorite teams and players, to cross-sell its betting service, he said.</p><p>The new CMO reports to Fanatics Betting and Gaming Chief Executive Matt King, who joined the company last year as it began to explore the betting market. Mr. King was previously CEO of FanDuel.</p><p>Mr. White said he and other Fanatics marketing leaders plan to collaborate with former Airbnb Inc. CMO and Fanatics board member Jonathan Mildenhall in the coming months to develop a cohesive brand strategy across the company's divisions.</p><p>\"We're going to want to build the brand and the business at the same time,\" Mr. White said, adding that he has begun recruiting marketing executives for his own team.</p><p>Mr. White said he was attracted by the company's potential for growth as well as its CEO's history in the social-justice movement. Mr. Rubin co-founded Reform Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for overhauling the criminal-justice system, with fellow entrepreneurs Daniel Loeb and Clara Wu Tsai as well as rappers Jay-Z and Meek Mill and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.</p><p>Fanatics filed a trademark application for its newest division earlier this year and recently won approval to do business in Maryland, though its New York application was denied.</p><p>When asked about the launch date, a Fanatics spokesman referred to Mr. Rubin's recent comment on a podcast that the company would be accepting bets on the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers by the end of the year. Mr. Rubin also recently announced that he had sold his stake in Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment LLC, the parent company of the 76ers and the National Hockey League's New Jersey Devils. He cited conflicts of interest arising from Fanatics' expansion.</p><p>Fanatics upended the trading-card industry last year by signing exclusive deals with Major League Baseball and the NBA, as well as the unions representing players in the MLB, the NBA and the National Football League, then this year acquiring Topps Co.'s trading-card business for $500 million.</p><p>Fanatics was valued at $27 billion earlier this year after raising $1.5 billion from Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co., among others.</p><p>Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com</p><p>Fanatics' Upstart Sports-Gambling Division Hires Marketing Chief</p>",
