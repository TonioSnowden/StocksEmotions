  "title": "Red Sox's TV Network to Offer $29.99 Monthly Streaming Service; The home of Boston's MLB and NHL teams says it will become the first U.S. regional sports network to offer fans in its footprint a stand-alone streaming option",
  "text": "<p>Cutting the cable TV cord can make it harder for fans to watch their local teams' games. Few online TV bundles such as FuboTV carry regional sports channels. NESN's stand-alone service will provide another option for fans of Major League Baseball's Red Sox and the National Hockey League's Bruins.</p><p>Regional sports channels were once engines of growth for media companies because of the high fees they could charge for carriage in cable and satellite TV packages. But the local sports networks are under pressure to adapt as consumer attention shifts to streaming video services.</p><p>While major networks that air national sports telecasts, including NBC and CBS, have started including some games in their direct-to-consumer streaming services, regional sports networks have been working to figure out their own plans.</p><p>Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., the largest owner of regional sports channels, is planning to launch a streaming app in some markets during the third quarter, with a broader rollout to follow. The company said it expects to charge $19.99 a month, or $189.99 annually.</p><p>Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal has explored streaming some of its own regional sports channels or selling them off.</p><p>Live sports remain one of the main attractions of the cable-TV bundle for consumers. The availability of local channels via stand-alone apps could encourage more cord-cutting.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you plan to subscribe to the New England Sports Network streaming service? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>While NESN's app will stream games to fans in the region, out-of-market fans can sign up for NHL's or MLB's own apps. NESN's price point is in line with that of the leagues' apps.</p><p>To make the annual subscription more attractive, NESN will offer those who buy a yearly package eight free Red Sox tickets, said Ahmed Darwish, NESN's chief marketing officer.</p><p>Initially, NESN 360 will be available on mobile devices, as well as on Roku and Apple TV's streaming devices. In the coming weeks, it will expand to Google TV and Amazon's Fire TV. Pay-TV subscribers will get access to the app free.</p><p>Explaining the strategy behind the streaming venture, Mr. Darwish said, \"How do we give value to the bundle? And how do we give an option for those on the outside?\" He said about a quarter of the people who contact the network regularly ask how they can watch NESN.</p><p>Pressure on the regional sports business has led to tensions between the networks and major TV distributors over carriage fees.</p><p>Dish Network Corp., which hasn't carried Sinclair's Bally's Sports Networks for nearly three years, stopped offering regional sports networks in December when it dropped NESN.</p><p>Cable giant Comcast late last year stopped carrying MSG Networks, which air live games of the New York Knicks, Rangers and Islanders, and the New Jersey Devils. Shortly after, MSG said it is planning to offer a direct-to-consumer streaming option by the end of 2022.</p><p>Similarly, Comcast and Dish dropped Altitude Sports, the regional sports channel for Denver Nuggets and Avalanche games, in 2019. Comcast and Altitude have been in a legal battle since then.</p><p>Write to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com</p><p>Red Sox's TV Network to Offer $29.99 Monthly Streaming Service</p>",
