  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Conan O'Brien Wants  You to Listen  ---  For his next act, the longtime TV host is building a podcast empire  ----  By John Jurgensen",
  "text": "<p>   Conan O'Brien ended a 28-year run on late-night television when he wound down his TBS talk show in June. That has led to misconceptions about his employment status. </p><p>   \"Everywhere I go, people say, 'Congratulations on your retirement!'\" he said in an interview. \"'There goes Conan, riding a donkey off over the hill into the mist.'\" </p><p>   In reality, he's as busy as he was on the air, building a comedy empire in a medium he once distrusted. </p><p>   His media company, Team Coco, has 10 podcasts in production, including a new one breaking down every episode of \"Parks and Recreation,\" hosted by a star (Rob Lowe) and a writer (Alan Yang) of the beloved sitcom. There's also a Q&amp;A show hosted by Mr. O'Brien's former sidekick, Andy Richter, and podcasts from comedians J.B. Smoove (a daily riff on affirmational wisdom), Nicole Byer (a raucous dating discussion) and Laci Mosley (a dive into scams and cons). </p><p>   Team Coco plans to launch up to six more podcasts in the next eight months, including \"The Weird Place,\" a scripted sketch comedy show created by \"Saturday Night Live\" hall of famer Dana Carvey. </p><p>   The heart of the activity is a podcast Mr. O'Brien has hosted for three years and 145 episodes so far. On \"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend,\" he interviews comedians and other famous people, from Bob Newhart to Barack Obama, at length -- a liberation after decades of talk-show banter in short bursts. \"It's giving me a connection that I wasn't getting before,\" he said. </p><p>   The podcast has offered Mr. O'Brien a new comedic gear, deepened his relationship with fans, and helped Team Coco fund more podcasts and sign talent. </p><p>   \"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend\" typically ranks among the top five most popular comedy series on Apple's dominant podcasting service. The show accounts for two-thirds of Team Coco's 13 million total monthly downloads. It generates more than half the slate's total sponsorship revenue, which is expected to reach roughly $20 million in 2021, Team Coco executives say. </p><p>   Mr. O'Brien devoted most of his adult life to legacy television, joining \"Saturday Night Live\" as a writer at age 24, followed by \"The Simpsons,\" then hosting late-night shows once helmed by David Letterman and Johnny Carson. Now, at 58 years old, he is wheeling into territory that is still being staked out. </p><p>   Media and tech companies hungry for content and subscribers are hunting for tentpole shows that command big, loyal audiences in an oversaturated podcasting market. Among the headline deals in this audio rush, Amazon.com Inc. purchased the rights to \"SmartLess,\" an interview show co-hosted by actors Will Arnett, Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes. Spotify Technology SA has snapped up exclusive rights to podcasts from Joe Rogan, actor Dax Shepard, sex-advice host Alexandra Cooper and more. Sirius XM Holdings Inc. bought the podcast producer and distributor Stitcher Inc., which also sells advertising for hundreds of shows including Team Coco's. </p><p>   Amid this industry spree, Team Coco executives say they are weighing their options, from a new licensing deal for their podcasts, to a sale of the whole company. But they intend to run the brand regardless. </p><p>   \"We're not looking to cash out or quit or retire,\" said Team Coco Chief Executive Jeff Ross, who has served as Mr. O'Brien's executive producer since 1993. </p><p>   The name \"Coco\" was coined by Tom Hanks, who led the \"Tonight Show\" audience in chanting that nickname during Mr. O'Brien's final taping in January of 2010. Ten days earlier the host had announced he would resign rather than move with \"The Tonight Show\" to midnight. It was his way of ending a humiliating process in which NBC planned to reinstall Jay Leno at the \"Tonight Show\" time slot. \"Team Coco\" emerged as a rally cry in \"a fan uprising,\" as Mr. Ross recalls it. </p><p>   \"The silver lining that came out of that traumatic, crazy, dark time was this explosion of support,\" Mr. O'Brien said. \"That moment was sort of a superhero origin story, as far as I'm concerned.\" </p><p>   Team Coco -- whose official name is Conaverticals LLC -- also showcases other comedians in stand-up specials, produces live events and sells merchandise. Since 2011, the company has distributed video clips from \"Conan\" (the TBS show, which Mr. O'Brien owns) across YouTube, Facebook and other platforms, a business expected to bring in $10 million this year, executives say. The terms of a joint venture with WarnerMedia, which produced \"Conan\" and owns TBS, shifted when the show ended, giving the AT&amp;T Inc. division a passive minority stake, and Team Coco the leeway to act more like a media startup. </p><p>   In that renegotiation, Mr. O'Brien agreed to front a new TV show for Warner's HBO Max streaming service. But he is still in the brainstorming stage, and he talks about the streaming show like it's a long-term school assignment that will get done eventually. </p><p>   For now, Mr. O'Brien is caught up in the more freewheeling routine of cranking out podcasts. At the Hollywood studio of Earwolf, one of the Stitcher podcast networks, he records in a small room where he sits across from his guests at a wooden table covered in doodle drawings. Aside from a couple podcast producers and an engineer in an adjacent room, there's no audience. </p><p>   \"It's really nice that I'm back in a fort made of pillows, screwing around. Yet we live in this time where me with two microphones in a pillow fort is legitimate,\" he said. \"It's a business, and it's a good business, but at this stage of my career, at this stage of my life, it's also a crazy gift.\" </p><p>   At first, however, he was skeptical. He worried a podcast might be perceived as a step down, or could simply tank. \"After spending years and years in TV, Conan said, 'What if it gets canceled?'\" recalls Team Coco President Adam Sachs, a veteran of several podcast companies. The host was assured that he'd be in charge of the podcast's fate and, besides, download statistics aren't publicly shared in the way Nielsen TV ratings are. </p><p>   Launched in 2018, \"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend\" finds the host often pursuing similar themes with his guests: How they discovered their talent; what forces drive their ambition; how they cope with ego and self-criticism. </p><p>   The audience gets a version of Mr. O'Brien unchecked by the time, budget and language constraints of television. \"They're hearing writers-room Conan,\" he said. </p><p>   The show also features his assistants Sona Movsesian and David Hopping, and podcast producer Matt Gourley. </p><p>   The most old-fashioned aspect of the podcasting industry -- hosts reading ads for their shows' sponsors -- turned into a signature of Mr. O'Brien's show. A recent spot for Long John Silver's lobster bites featured his off-the-cuff impersonations of a pirate and a member of the Kennedy dynasty. </p><p>   Mr. O'Brien's arch style lets him satirize the sponsorship system and himself as pitchman, while still delivering the goods and preventing listeners from skipping the ads. Advertisers pay a premium for that: between $40 and $50 for every thousand downloads of his show, Team Coco says, roughly twice the typical fee for a popular podcast. </p><p>   The company is considering another potential podcast for Mr. O'Brien based on his love of history. But future growth for Team Coco will hinge on talent other than its namesake. \"It's just impossible to scale if it's all Conan,\" Mr. Sachs said. \"It can only get so big, and he can only do so much.\" </p><p></p>",
