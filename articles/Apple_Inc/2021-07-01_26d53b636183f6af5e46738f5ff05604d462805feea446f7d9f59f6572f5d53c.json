  "text": "<p>No sensible person could reject the claim of the Chinese Communist party to have eliminated extreme poverty during the 70 years or more it has been in power. It is a point well made by Zeng Rong of the Chinese embassy in London (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71896fe3-7377-491f-bffa-ec62658641ed\">Letters</a>, June 25). But she rather overstates her case (that China “has the right to seek a path of development which suits its national conditions”) in asserting that the CCP and the Beijing government are focusing on building a strong economy “while at the same time staying open and inclusive, and learning from others through exchanges”.</p> <p>China is not an open society, nor does the CCP try to “include” those who disagree with its policies. If that were the case, I would not be reading on other pages in the FT about the death of Apple Daily in Hong Kong and the persecution of the Uyghurs. Any “ideological prejudice”, superiority complexes or condescension in the air we breathe is from the propaganda organs of the CCP and contributions from the Chinese embassy. The CCP brooks no criticism and displays its own brand of narrow-mindedness of which this newspaper and other western media are wrongly accused.</p> <p><strong>Jack Thompson<br></strong><em>Former BBC South East Asia<br>Correspondent, London SE21, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Hong Kong gives the lie to Beijing's ‘openness' claims' FT.com 1 July.
