  "text": "<p>\"Apple has sort of singled themselves out as the only company that is trying to control, like unilaterally, what apps get on a device,\" the Meta Platforms Inc. META CEO said at the New York Times Dealbook Summit in New York on Wednesday. \"I don't think that's a sustainable or good place to be.\"</p><p>\"It is problematic for one company to control what kind of app experiences get onto a device,\" Zuckerberg added.</p><p>Apple's AAPL considerable sway over the app market through its App Store has prompted vitriolic remarks this week from Ek, Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk, Epic Games Inc. CEO Tim Sweeney and others for its onerous commission fees (up to 30%) and in-store payment system.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Ek — who has pleaded for Congress to vote on antitrust legislation after years of hearings excoriating Big Tech — tweeted: \"So how much longer will we look away from this threat to the future of the internet? How many more consumers will be denied choice? There's been a lot of talk. Talk is helpful but we need action.\"</p><p>Read more: Spotify CEO joins Elon Musk in calling out Apple for 'shameless … bullying'</p><p>Musk, who got in his digs for many of the same reasons, suggested in a meme this week he was willing to \"go to war\" rather than pay Apple's fees. But by Wednesday, Musk was on Twitter to post a video of a short scene from Apple's Cupertino, Calif., campus with a conciliatory message, thanking Apple CEO Tim Cook for showing him around.</p><p>Read more: Elon Musk thanks Apple CEO Tim Cook for campus tour, suggesting possible détente</p><p>Apple has remained quiet about the sniping comments.</p><p>Much like Ek and Sweeney, Zuckerberg's hostilities with the iPhone maker run deep.</p><p>Zuckerberg has repeatedly taken Apple to task for its Apple Store policies and the company's walled garden approach to its computing platform. At Meta's Connect conference in July, he told The Verge that Apple's unannounced VR platform would be a \"closed ecosystem\" while Meta's system is \"open.\"</p><p>The sniping between Meta and Apple is mutual. Apple's Cook has blasted Facebook for years over its handling of consumer data, leading Apple to impose a change to its privacy and data collection policy that requires mobile marketers to ask consent from users to track them. That policy has cost Meta billions of dollars in revenue, former Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner acknowledged.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg joins the Apple bashing: It is 'problematic for one company to control what kind of app experiences get onto a device'</p>",
