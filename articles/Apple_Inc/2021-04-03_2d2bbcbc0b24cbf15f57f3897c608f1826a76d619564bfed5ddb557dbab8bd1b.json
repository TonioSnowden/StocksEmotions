  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Gear & Gadgets -- Rumble Seat: The Ultra-Fashionable Infiniti QX55 (Sorry Not Sorry)",
  "text": "<p>Infiniti, the luxury division of Nissan (of the Paris-based Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance), has had a rocky few years in the U.S., due largely to an aging product line that was weighted toward sedans. Meanwhile, the brand's offerings of SUVs had also gotten long in the tusk. The QX55 is the first of two new family movers entering the big tent for model-year 2022. The other is the three-row SUV (QX60).</p><p>The flagship of Infiniti's fleet remains the large and uncontroversial QX80 SUV. Everyone agrees it's heinous.</p><p>The QX55 shares most of what makes the QX50 family crossover tick -- the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with variable-compression ratio linkages (VC-Turbo); continuously variable transmission; and front-biased all-wheel drive, standard on QX55 -- but re-dresses the package with a pert fastback shape, over bigger wheels and tires. The QX55, management notes, is a hollaback to the pioneering and under-appreciated FX models (2002-2013). I might observe that the old, cab-rearward design was way cooler looking, but how is that even helpful?</p><p>The more generously equipped QX55 costs about $3,000 more than the comparable QX50 and gives up 10.3 cubic feet of cargo space compared to its sibling. Such is the price of fashion fastbacks. However, the Infiniti does offer more storage (26.9 cubic feet) than either of its notional competitors, the Mercedes-Benz GLC and BMW X4. Judging by the triumphant tone in the press materials, it's clear Infiniti marketers think their car is the fairest of them all. Let's hope they never see an Alfa Romeo Stelvio.</p><p>I have some questions about the blueprints. What is with those crest-like projections across the hood? I know they are supposed to be balanced, graphically, by the bowing negative drafts across the doors. I don't think that works too good, y'all.</p><p>The back seat has nothing to apologize for. The abbreviated QX55's design preserves a surprising amount of rear passenger space, especially leg room. Head room is also fine, for me, at 6-foot-1. Also, note the rear door openings are large with shut lines extending well over the wheel wells. The rear seat bench also has about 6 inches of fore/aft travel as well as reclining seatbacks. Entering and exiting the rear is effortless.</p><p>Under the hood is a longer story. There you will find, and hear, the company's 2.0-liter VC-Turbo, with variable-compression ratio linkages. These allow the engine to seamlessly vary compression ratios (from 14:1 to 8:1), depending on demand and load, in order to save fuel. That's amazing! But it isn't quiet. And the VC-Turbo has both port and direct fuel injectors, which add to the dither. Said engine is attached to a very strong and capable continuously variable transmission, with stepped-gear simulation and even automatic rev-matching on downshifting. But it's still a CVT and it can drone a bit under high load, like me.</p><p>It's fair to guess that Nissan didn't initially plan on pairing a VC-Turbo engine and CVT in a premium/entry-luxury product, due to the character of the powertrain. But here we are. To bring it up to snuff, the QX55 relies on extensive soundproofing, acoustically laminated side front glass, and the audio system's active noise-cancellation system, which is standard across three trim levels.</p><p>If drivers want to pleasure themselves aurally, the Sport mode turns up the Active Sound Enhancement and digitally recreates racy engine noises through the loudspeakers. Rummm.</p><p>Not to be too hard on our fashion-forward friend. There are only two instances where the rube comes out. First, the cold-start cycle, like in the morning. That's pretty fraught. And if you ask for 100% throttle for an extended period, yeah, it doesn't sound like it's enjoying that. Still, the QX55 nips around town with pace and well-planted alacrity. From a stoplight it will hit 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds, according to my iPhone's stopwatch. At interstate speeds the mechanism seeks its lowest energy state, and most tranquil range, thrumming in the background, below the low roar of (stylishly) large tires.</p><p>The QX55 comes in three flavors of posh: Luxe, Essential and Sensory. The Luxe trim level includes dual upper and lower touch screens; wireless Apple CarPlay, with USB-connected Android Auto; and Wi-Fi hotspot capacity for up to seven devices.</p><p>Our tester was a fully stocked Sensory edition ($58,075), with its curvilinear dash and door forms vacuum-wrapped in red-and-black leather; matching semi-aniline leather seat jackets; natural maple wood cabin trim; and the bossiest of Bose's sound systems, with 16 speakers concealed about its cabin.</p><p>Infiniti isn't exactly rushing into the arms of electrification. In November 2019, the company announced plans to bring three electrified models to market by 2022. But this week, an Infiniti spokesperson said the global pandemic and other challenges forced them to re-evaluate product plans, meaning the series-hybrid and full EV versions will be on offer \"in the coming years.\"</p><p>As for the apparent change in plans, the company was unapologetic.</p><p>---</p><p>2022 INFINITI QX55</p><p>Base price: $47,525</p><p>Price, as tested: $58,075 (\"Sensory\" trim level)</p><p>Powertrain: 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with direct and port injection; continuously variable transmission; front-biased all-wheel drive.</p><p>Power/torque: 268 hp at 5,600 rpm/280 lb-ft 4,400-4,800 rpm</p><p>Length/width/height/wheelbase: 186.3/74.9/63.8/110.2 inches</p><p>Curb weight: 4,065 pounds</p><p>0-60 mph: 6.5 seconds (est.)</p><p>EPA fuel economy: 22/28/25 mpg, city/highway/combined</p><p>Cargo Capacity: 26.9/54.1 cubic feet (behind 2nd/1st row)</p>",
