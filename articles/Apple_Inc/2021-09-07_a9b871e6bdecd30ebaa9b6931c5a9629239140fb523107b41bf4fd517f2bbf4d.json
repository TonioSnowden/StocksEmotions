  "text": "<p>\n  All in favor of ending an \"endless\" or \"forever\" war, raise your hand. Wow, it's unanimous. All in favor of prosperity, motherhood and apple pie? Wow, it's unanimous again. You have to admire the Biden administration's ability to use buzzwords to frame questions in support of its narrative (\"A Dishonest Afghan Accounting,\" Review and Outlook, Sept. 1). </p><p>\n  With air power, artillery and other technological support, a few thousand U.S. troops were adequate to support the Afghan forces and keep the Taliban at bay. It was in America's best interest to do so to deny radical Islamic terrorists a haven from which to plot and launch attacks on the U.S. </p><p>\n  The only endless war is the war on terror, because our enemy is a radical ideology. I fear we'll be reminded of that, painfully, before long. </p><p>\n  Thomas A. Smith </p><p>\n  Sarasota, Fla. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  I am probably one of many readers left speechless by President Biden's assertion, referring to the evacuation of more than 120,000 people, that \"no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history.\" </p><p>\n  Recall Dunkirk? In under two weeks in 1940, 338,000 troops were evacuated on a flotilla of small boats. Perhaps the president has forgotten Santayana's dictum: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" </p><p>\n  Tom Emanuel </p><p>\n  Shelton, Conn. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  From his basement campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Del., candidate Biden promised that he would \"restore the soul\" of our nation and abandon \"America First\" policies in favor of a foreign policy that reflected the consensus among U.S. allies. </p><p>\n  The catastrophe unleashed by Mr. Biden's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of U.S. citizens (only 90% of those who wanted to leave) and allied Afghans (a minuscule fraction) gives the lie to his vows. Worse, it impugns American values and the \"soul\" of a great world power, while forcing our allies to acquiesce in American unilateralism in its most stark and grotesque form. </p><p>\n  Steven Sarfatti </p><p>\n  Cabin John, Md. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  While Mr. Biden's strident, hectoring speech on Aug. 31 included many remarkable statements, one jumped out that speaks to his management style: \"The decision to end the military airlift operations at Kabul airport was based on the unanimous recommendation of my civilian and military advisers -- the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the service chiefs and the commanders in the field.\" </p><p>\n  They say that when two people agree on everything, one isn't doing much thinking. What does it say when everyone in the president's inner circle agrees? The whole recent Afghanistan debacle shows that the president has surrounded himself with yes-men who tell him what he wants to hear, since he has already made unalterable decisions. </p><p>\n  Fred Van Bennekom </p><p>\n  Bolton, Mass. </p><p></p>",
