  "text": "<p>   As a Jew and vegetarian, I find it disappointing that the Orthodox Union won't issue its kosher certification for Impossible Pork (\"For Fake Pork, Kosher Label Proves Elusive,\" Page One, Nov. 16). Apparently, \"pork,\" the word, is radioactive, regardless of ingredients. Jews are creative people, so I suggest first winking, then rebranding it as \"Porque,\" which invites an ad campaign playing off \"por que,\" Spanish for \"why.\" Given so many kosher foods are cooked up to simulate what's nonkosher, what's so impossible here? </p><p>   Bill Apple </p><p>   New York </p><p>   --- </p><p>   I enjoyed reading about the challenges of certifying fake pork in the kosher-meat industry. But I do take issue with the quote from David Zvi Kalman of the Shalom Hartman Institute: \"This is possibly the most important decision for Judaism in the 21st century.\" Really? </p><p>   Rena Schnaidman </p><p>   Teaneck, N.J. </p><p></p>",
