  "text": "<p>It has been a time of turmoil for Pinterest, which operates a free online platform for sharing images that inspire projects such as planning weddings, completing home renovations and creating recipes.</p><p>In June, Ben Silbermann stepped down as chief executive, becoming executive chairman. The company named Bill Ready, who had been president of commerce at Alphabet Inc.'s Google since 2020, as his successor. r</p><p>The moves came after several Pinterest executives departed in recent months, including its head of global business operations and its investor-relations chief.</p><p>Mr. Silbermann, one of three Pinterest co-founders, has a roughly 37% voting stake in the company, according to its latest proxy filing from April, which could limit Elliott's ability to force changes.</p><p>Pinterest's business grew dramatically during the pandemic, and in February, the company reported its first full-year profit and more than $2 billion in annual revenue. But while revenue grew by 18% in the quarter that ended in March from a year earlier, global active monthly users fell 9% and the company posted a net loss of $5 million, as Covid restrictions eased and people began spending more time offline. Changes to Apple Inc.'s privacy rules and a slowdown in ad spending also weighed in on the company's results.</p><p>Shares in Pinterest, which has a market valuation of about $12 billion, are down around 50% year to date, worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which has fallen about 30%. The company went public in 2019 at $19 a share. The stock surged above $80 last year but is now below the IPO price, closing at $17.56 Thursday. The stock rose about 25% after hours when The Wall Street Journal reported on the stake.</p><p>In recent years, Pinterest has been looking to boost revenue beyond its advertising-centric model by expanding into e-commerce. The company partnered with Shopify Inc. in 2020, giving its users the ability to purchase products they find on its platform by clicking on a link to a merchant's website. In June, Pinterest acquired The Yes, an artificial-intelligence platform that customizes the fashion-shopping experience for users.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
