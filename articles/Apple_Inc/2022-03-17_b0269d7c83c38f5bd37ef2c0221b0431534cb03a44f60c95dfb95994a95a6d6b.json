  "title": "Websites' Privacy Notices Are Supposed to Be Reassuring. They Often Aren't. These notices, telling consumers how their data is protected, may make people feel more vulnerable, according to a new study",
  "text": "<p>Privacy notices typically describe how a company and its affiliates collect and use customers' personal information, such as their physical address, email address, phone number and device ID. Some companies simply describe how they share customer information with third parties, if applicable, or how affiliated companies may use personal data. Others take the extra step of outlining why these disclosures are being made, using language that explicitly tells customers they care about the safety of their data.</p><p>While there are no standard formats for privacy notices, Apple last year began requiring that software developers add a privacy label resembling a nutrition label to any app published through its App Store.</p><p>To determine how consumers respond to privacy notices, the researchers conducted seven studies, collecting data from nearly 20,000 participants. Several experiments compared consumers' interest in purchasing from a website or app that included or didn't include a privacy notice. Researchers also tested how changes in the wording of a notice affected consumers' willingness to purchase.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you react to website privacy notices? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Results challenge the notion that simply telling consumers their personal data is protected will make them more comfortable, says lead researcher Aaron Brough, an associate professor of marketing and the Harry M. Reid endowed professor of research at Utah State University's Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. Rather, privacy notices can, ironically, lead consumers to feel more vulnerable—and could actually drive away business—when they don't include messaging that indicates the company cares about the purchaser's safety and privacy. \"It's like going to an elementary school and seeing bulletproof glass and metal detectors,\" he says. \"Their purpose is to protect you, but instead of making you feel safe, they could make you feel vulnerable.\"</p><p>What is helpful in driving purchase decisions, researchers found, are \"benevolence cues\"—statements such as: \"We care about protecting your privacy\"; or \"We respect you and promise to treat you fairly\"; or \"We are committed to the protection of your information.\"</p><p>Although such statements offer no legal protection, they help build trust by conveying to consumers that companies have good intentions, Dr. Brough says. In one study, people were more likely to buy a product when a privacy notice had these cues than when a privacy notice didn't include comforting language or when privacy information wasn't readily available at all during the checkout process.</p><p>These takeaways are important because many companies don't use caring language in their privacy notices. Researchers analyzed the privacy notices of 50 publicly traded companies randomly selected from the Nasdaq stock exchange and found the practice wasn't common.</p><p>Ms. Winokur Munk is a writer in West Orange, N.J.
