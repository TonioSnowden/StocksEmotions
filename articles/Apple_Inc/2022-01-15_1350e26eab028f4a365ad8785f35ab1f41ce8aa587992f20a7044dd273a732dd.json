My week was yet again dominated by <strong>Novak Djokovic</strong>'s ongoing fight against the Australian government, which has made a second attempt to remove him from the country. The saga is damaging, not to mention distracting, for not only the tennis star but also the <strong>Australian Open</strong> itself, and we have a special dispatch from Nic Fildes, the FT's Australia and Pacific correspondent on the political ramifications. </p> <p>In our second item, outgoing sports editor Murad Ahmed meets with the owner of <strong>ACF Fiorentina</strong>, the Italian-American billionaire <strong>Rocco Commisso</strong>, who is railing against the business status quo in <strong>Serie A</strong>. Do read on — <em>Sam Agini, sports business reporter.</em></p> <h1>Djokovic's battle of the courts in Australia</h1> <p>This week's Australian Open in Melbourne has rapidly turned into one of the biggest global sporting stories for all the wrong reasons. </p> <p>Novak Djokovic, a nine-time champion of the tournament, has overshadowed the rest of Australia's summer of sport. The Serbian will overtake <strong>Roger Federer</strong> and <strong>Rafael Nadal</strong>'s trophy haul, and arguably position himself as the greatest tennis player of all time, if he wins again. </p> <p>But no one is talking about tennis. As of late Friday, Djokovic has had his visa revoked by the Australian government for a second time, throwing the men's draw into uncertainty amid an ongoing international stand-off over the Serbian star's vaccination status.</p> <p>Let's rewind. Last week, the <strong>Australian Border Force</strong> detained the world's number one ranked player at Melbourne's airport and initially revoked his visa after he could not provide enough evidence to justify a medical exemption that would allow him to enter Australia as an unvaccinated visitor. </p> <p>If it seemed like an over reaction overseas, it didn't in Australia. Melbourne has just emerged from the longest lockdown in the world, Omicron is running rampant through the country and the move to grant Djokovic — a vaccine sceptic — an exemption at a time when state governments have mandated vaccines, caused genuine outrage.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Australian prime minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, whose Liberal party is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad6a1027-4229-40dd-873f-191163333c43\">trailing in the polls</a> during an election year, opted to go on the offensive. He raised the prospect of putting Djokovic on the first plane home — before his inbound flight even landed. </p> <p>But Djokovic's return serve against the Australian government proved unexpectedly strong. His visa cancellation was quashed by a federal judge and the publication of a transcript of his border interviews curried sympathy for the star. While he enjoyed a late night hit out in the <strong>Rod Laver Arena</strong>, Serbian fans rioted in the streets outside his lawyer's offices fearing their hero was not yet safe. </p> <p>They were right. On Wednesday, Djokovic admitted that he had held an interview with<strong> L'Equipe</strong> last month while knowing he was positive for Covid-19 and further revealed his agent incorrectly filled out his documentation — which is a serious offence — triggering a new wave of opprobrium. </p> <p>Djokovic may have a mixed record on the tennis courts and legal courts, but in the court of public opinion he is tanking: a poll conducted by News Corp of 61,000 people found that 84 per cent of respondents said he should be deported. </p> <p>The government's decision to serve up another deportation order yesterday means that Djokovic will be back in, rather than on, the courts before he can think about beating records. A late night hearing in Melbourne revealed that Djokovic will probably face fresh detention before another appeal on Sunday — the eve of the tournament open.</p> <h1>Rocco Commisso's struggle for the future of Fiorentina</h1> <p>Rocco Commisso acquired Italian Serie A football club ACF Fiorentina in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertkidd/2019/07/11/us-billionaire-rocco-commisso-on-his-plans-for-italian-soccer-club-fiorentina/?sh=226807574c46\">2019</a> for €170m. The US billionaire thought he was doing an act of service, pumping money back into the country of his birth and the sport he loves.</p> <p>As detailed in this FT Weekend Magazine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07b8a172-5381-41a7-b427-a8280bb95102\">story</a> that profiles Commisso, he has become incensed at how the football business is run. </p> <p>Among his biggest gripes is with the agents that represent footballers. One example is ongoing difficulties involving Fiorentina's star striker, <strong>Dusan Vlahovic</strong>, who is attracting strong attention from rival clubs, such as <strong>Arsenal</strong> of the <strong>English</strong> <strong>Premier League</strong>.</p> <p>First, some background. The so-called Bosman ruling, a 1995 European Court of Justice judgment, opened up rules on players moving between clubs, leading the wealthiest sides to scour the world in order to stack their sides with the finest talents. </p> <p>Ever since, cash has flown away from owners and towards their labour force. </p> <p>In European football, most clubs spend around 70 to 80 per cent of their revenues on footballer wages. According to <strong>Fifa</strong>, international football's governing body, global spending on player transfer fees in 2019 was around £5.5bn, while fees paid to agents organising moves totalled around £550m.&#xa0;</p> <p>This booming trade in players is also largely unregulated. Agents can essentially charge whatever they want. </p> <p>In one example in 2016, Frenchman <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> moved for a then world record transfer fee of £89.3m from Italy's <strong>Juventus</strong> to England's <strong>Manchester United</strong>. But the player's agent, <strong>Mino Raiola</strong>, secured £41m himself for brokering the move, including commissions from Juventus, Manchester United and Pogba.</p> <p>Commisso backs proposed reforms from Fifa — opposed by the likes of Raiola — to cap commissions to just 10 per cent of a transfer fee, while also ending “dual representation,” so an agent can no longer be paid by multiple parties in a transfer.</p> <p>When Vlahovic's playing contract runs out in 2023, he is able to leave for free, giving him a strong hand to negotiate better terms with Fiorentina or any club he moves to next. </p> <p>People briefed on the talks say Fiorentina offered Vlahovic a salary worth €5m a season, more than any player in the club's history. That sum has been rejected as too small. Still, the real problem appears to be the demands of Vlahovic's agency, the Belgrade-based <strong>International Sports Office</strong>.</p> <p>Those familiar with the talks said the agency wants; an €8m fee to renew Vlahovic's contract with Fiorentina, an “exclusive mandate” to sell the striker in future, a 10 per cent commission of any transfer fee and a further 10 per cent fee from any buying club. In other words, a payday worth tens of millions of euros to facilitate just one transfer.</p> <p>A person close to International Sports Office said the terms were “in line with the industry specific standards”. Commisso reckons it shows how “screwed up” the football business is. On this, he's probably right.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Manchester City</strong>, the Abu Dhabi-controlled Premier League football club, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e949a154-1227-418b-920c-a7310788b5f2\">surpassed</a> rival <strong>Manchester United </strong>in the race to generate the most revenues in English football. It's the first time any club in England has topped United's revenue.</p></li>  <li><p>The Premier League <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ac31ea8-6692-4f48-81f5-4573a7e4a1dd\">won</a> a High Court payout of at least $212m from its former broadcast partner in China, in a sign that the world's richest domestic football competition will take legal action to enforce contracts where necessary. However, court documents showed that Hong Kong-based <strong>PPLive</strong> stopped making payments to its legal representatives, with the league set to begin the process of recovering its fees and costs.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>PGA Tour</strong>, the North American golf organisation, <a href=\"https://www.pgatour.com/news/2022/01/12/netflix-documentary-pga-tour-masters-pga-championship-us-open-open-championship-formula-one.html\">teamed up with</a> <strong>Netflix</strong> to produce a documentary series on the lives of the world's top players, as more sports look to mimic the success of <em>Drive to Survive</em>, the streaming platform's behind-the-scenes look at <strong>Formula One</strong>. The show is credited with stirring interest in the car racing series.</p></li>  <li><p>State funding for English cricket <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cdcafe3-9867-4727-81d7-9eea9e8df45a\">should be cut</a> if the sport's governing body cannot show that anti-racism efforts are working, according to a proposal by MPs. The report by the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee follows abuse revelations by whistleblower and former player<strong> Azeem Rafiq</strong> last year.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Apple</strong> wants in on live sports rights and is in talks with <strong>Major League Baseball</strong> about broadcasting games, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/10/apple-in-serious-talks-with-mlb-to-broadcast-games/\">according to</a> the <em>New York Post. </em>Such an agreement would have to wait until the league and the<strong> MLB Players Association </strong>agree terms on a new collective bargaining agreement. Both sides are still negotiating and team owners locked out the players last month.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Final Whistle</h1> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cowboy_Channel/status/1479966307005124608\">https://twitter.com/Cowboy_Channel/status/1479966307005124608</a> <p>Less than a month from now, the best skiers, skaters, curlers, and snowboarders will descend upon Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics. One sport without a feature stage at the world's largest sporting event is skijoring, in which a human skier is pulled along by a dog or horse. Part equestrian, part freestyle skiing, it already has a devoted following and deep-pocketed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/542e84a5-caed-4b8e-bcd7-63051ae65ce1\">backers like Credit Suisse</a>.
