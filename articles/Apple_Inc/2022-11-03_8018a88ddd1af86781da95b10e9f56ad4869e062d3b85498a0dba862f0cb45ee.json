Stuffed with Parmesan, prosciutto, garlic and herbs, rolled and roasted until the skin browns and crackles, this is a quicker-cooking alternative to the standard Thanksgiving bird.",
  "text": "<p>IT WAS the November of the first year of the pandemic. The lockdowns were still in place, and boredom had replaced the initial shock of it all. Thanksgiving was around the corner, but that year the feast would be just for my husband, David, and me plus a neighbor. This would not be our usual holiday, which invariably involves dragging out the leaves for the dining table and rummaging through the basement in search of the back-up silverware and a few more wine glasses.</p><p>That year, David arranged our garage so it functioned as an intimate yet socially distanced café for three. As for the menu, I've never been a fan of traditional roast turkey—let's be honest, it's kind of bland and dry—and for three people, even the smallest turkey wouldn't make sense. I needed an alternative that was practical but festive enough to bring some much-needed cheer.</p><p>I have two restaurants in Portland, Ore.—Nostrana and Oven and Shaker—both of which fortunately survived the pandemic. But back in 2020, I was filling my days with lots of home cooking and hours of food conversations with my mentor, friend and culinary inspiration, Judy Witts Francini, an American who lives and cooks in Certaldo, Italy, her husband's hometown in Tuscany. Judy knows how crazy I am about all things pork, and in particular my devotion to porchetta, a Tuscan specialty. She suggested I make turchetta for Thanksgiving, solving two problems: my lack of interest in cooking a giant bird and unwillingness to eat bland roast turkey.</p><p>Though porchetta has many expressions, the basic concept is a boneless pork loin or pork shoulder that's butterflied, spread with herbs and garlic. The pork is then rolled up, creating a pinwheel effect on the interior. That rolled pork is then wrapped in pork belly with its skin and roasted. You end up with concentric circles of deliciousness, with a crispy exterior and a savory, moist interior. Porchetta is served sliced, on its own or in a sandwich.</p><p>Using boneless turkey breast instead of boneless pork isn't a one-for-one substitution, however. For starters, turkey breast is very lean. I'd have to do something to add fatty goodness to the turkey—hello, Parmigiano and prosciutto! And while I consider pork the most flavorful meat, turkey breast is better as a vehicle for other flavors than as a meat with a distinctive character of its own.</p><p>Cooks have been playing with the turchetta concept for years and using various ways to add flavor and fat to the situation. Some opt for wrapping the turkey breast in bacon, or stuffing the interior with mozzarella; most use the classic porchetta seasonings of rosemary and/or sage, garlic and fennel seed.</p><p>Using Judy's turchetta recipe as my guide, I decided to go \"classic Italian\" all the way, with sliced garlic, ground fennel seed and fresh rosemary and sage as the seasonings, along with a generous amount of Parmigiano-Reggiano as both a flavor and fat enhancement. With a layer of thinly sliced prosciutto I brought some pork into the picture after all.</p><p>I butterflied a turkey breast and pounded it out to an even thickness with a flat mallet. Then I layered on all those good things, rolled up the breast and tied it so the skin would stay in place on the outside.</p><p>Porchetta is usually served on its own, but given that this dish was to be the centerpiece for a holiday meal, I thought a sauce would be appropriate. After browning the rolled turkey breast on the stovetop in some garlic and rosemary-scented olive oil, I added red wine to the pan, let it reduce a bit, and then transferred the pan to the oven.</p><p>As the turchetta roasted, the wine mixed with the turkey juices (and some escaped Parmigiano, no doubt), and the whole thing reduced into a savory sauce. I whisked in some butter for added richness. And I knew this Thanksgiving wouldn't be our last to feature turchetta.</p><p>A Thanksgiving meal isn't only about the turkey, of course. You could pair the turchetta with whatever traditional sides your family likes (or expects), but I tend to lean into simple Italian vegetable preparations: Creamy white beans simmered with sage, whole garlic cloves, and olive oil. Broccoli rabe boiled until tender and then sautéed with garlic and chile flakes. Roasted potatoes with rosemary and garlic. Are you detecting a theme here? Garlic is certainly an ingredient to give thanks for.</p><p>For dessert, perhaps an all-American pumpkin tart. And let's not forget the all-important Thanksgiving leftovers. Mix apple butter with a dollop of Dijon mustard, spread it on a roll, stuff the roll with sliced turchetta, and you have a very fine next-day sandwich.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Share your experience with this recipe.
