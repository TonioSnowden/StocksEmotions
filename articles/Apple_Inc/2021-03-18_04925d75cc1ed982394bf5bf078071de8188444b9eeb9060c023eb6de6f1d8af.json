  "title": "Apple Notches a Legal Win In France Over App Privacy",
  "text": "<p>\"We can't intervene just because there might be a negative impact for companies in the ecosystem,\" said Isabelle de Silva, head of France's competition authority, at a news conference. \"At this stage, we haven't found flagrant examples of discrimination.\"</p><p>The authority said it plans to pursue an in-depth investigation to determine whether Apple's changes could be regarded as \"self-preferencing\" by imposing stricter rules on third-party apps than it does on itself. That probe could stretch to next year, Ms. de Silva said.</p><p>Wednesday's decision removes one source of doubt over Apple's plans, announced last year, to require apps on its phones and tablets to get opt-in permission from users before collecting their advertising identifiers, unique strings of letters and numbers companies use to identify individuals to show them targeted ads and monitor how ad campaigns performed.</p><p>Privacy advocates and regulators have generally praised moves like Apple's, saying consumers should have as much control as possible over how their data is collected and used. In recent years, a push toward greater online privacy has resulted in new laws in Europe and California. But companies in the online-ad ecosystem have said such changes put them at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>The companies behind the complaint, filed last fall through a group of trade associations, argued few Apple users will agree to be tracked, making it harder for apps to make money from personalized ads and hurting companies that broker their sale.</p><p>Damien Geradin, the competition lawyer representing the coalition of industry groups, said the companies were disappointed with the French decision but satisfied that the authority would pursue an in-depth probe. \"Apple is not off the hook yet,\" Mr. Geradin said.</p><p>Apple applauded the decision and said it would work with the authority on its investigation. \"We firmly believe that users' data belongs to them, and that they should control when that data is shared, and with whom,\" an Apple spokesman said.</p><p>The French regulator's decision comes as tech giants including Apple, Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. are coming under scrutiny in Europe and the U.S. -- both on antitrust grounds for their treatment of smaller rivals, and on privacy grounds.</p><p>Wednesday's decision is the first major one to highlight how that push to protecting user privacy can be at odds with regulators' efforts to safeguard online competition. That is because one of tech's most popular business models is targeting ads at individuals based on their online behavior, and smaller companies sometimes accuse the giants of using privacy as a pretext to cut off data they need.</p><p>Earlier this month, some companies complained that Google's plan to stop supporting tech that tracks people's web browsing behavior for advertising purposes would increase Google's ad monopoly because it already has so much user data from its own properties.</p><p>\"We are seeing more and more competition questions around privacy and data protection,\" Ms. de Silva said, adding she had solicited advice from France's privacy regulator, which she said backed Apple's plans as good for users and neutrally applied. Ms. de Silva said her authority might investigate Google's plan to remove tracking technology from its Chrome browser, similarly to the U.K.</p><p>Facebook has also attacked the Apple plan, arguing that it is an abuse of dominance that would hurt smaller companies. But restricting Apple's identifiers would also undermine one strength of Facebook's business: how it gathers data from mobile apps.</p>",
