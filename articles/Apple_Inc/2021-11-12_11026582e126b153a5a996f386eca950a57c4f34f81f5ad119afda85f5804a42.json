  "title": "As Taylor Swift Rerecorded Her 'Red' Album, Universal Reworked Contracts; The world's largest music company has revamped record deals to block artists from rerecording their music",
  "text": "<p>In its recent agreements, Universal has been effectively doubling the amount of time that the contracts restrict an artist from rerecording their work, according to music attorneys and executives. At a time when making—or remaking—and distributing music is easier and cheaper than ever, Universal, the world's largest label company, is moving to protect its investments in artists' work.</p><p>Recording nearly identical covers of her early albums is the latest step in Ms. Swift's long legal tussle to control her back catalog and musical legacy. Two years ago, she grew frustrated after attempting unsuccessfully to buy the master-recording copyrights as they changed hands twice against her wishes. They ultimately landed with Los Angeles-based investment firm Shamrock Capital Advisors last year. Universal, which distributes Ms. Swift's recordings, new and old, benefits from all of her music.</p><p>Both Ms. Swift's ambitious project and Universal's contract changes with its artists illustrate the shifting power dynamics in the music business, which has been upended by streaming. Meanwhile, the rocketing value of music copyrights has come into focus for both artists and investors.</p><p>The stricter rerecording parameters are part of a broader overhaul of Universal's standard recording agreement in response to the changing industry, according to a person with knowledge of the contracts, who said the changes predate Ms. Swift's rerecording endeavor.</p><p>While other artists have rerecorded their music to varying degrees of success, Ms. Swift's public crusade to gain ownership of her life's work has garnered broad support from fans and new listeners alike, and encouraged other artists to seek control over their music.</p><p>\"What Taylor did is a game changer, not just for her fans, but for other artists. She is inspiring artists to rerecord their songs and control their music,\" said Susan Genco, board member of artists' rights group Music Artists Coalition and co-president of the Azoff Company. \"Taylor is leading by example: Showing fans and artists that it's possible to take control of their future.\"</p><p>Rerecording restrictions are typical in any record deal as a measure to prevent an artist from creating competitive copies of the music in which a label has invested. Historically, a label takes ownership of recording copyrights, known as master recordings, in exchange for assuming the financial risk of betting on, distributing and promoting an artist's work.</p><p>Prior to the rise of music consumption on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, music labels were less threatened by the prospect of rerecording because releasing music on a wide scale without the help of a label was far more difficult. Now, the ease of digitally recording, distributing and promoting music has diminished labels' gatekeeper status, which was prevalent when costly physical formats and radio were the keys to stardom.</p><p>Artists are also finding early success releasing music to YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and streaming services, often stoking bidding wars between labels who want to sign them. Because more artists are coming to the table with such leverage—the ability to release music on their own and find an audience online—labels are having to make more concessions.</p><p>In these negotiations many artists, both new and old, are seeking ownership of their master recordings, which gives them more control over how their music is used and a greater split of the revenue it generates. In a typical record deal, a label can take 80% of streaming revenue, with just 20% going to an artist. When artists own their masters, they keep around 80% to 95% of that revenue, music lawyers say.</p><p>Taylor Swift Saga</p><p>* We Compared 'Taylor's Version' Songs With the Original Taylor Swift Albums (Nov. 12)</p><p>* Taylor Swift's Early Music Catalog Changes Hands Again (Nov. 6)</p><p>* Scooter Braun Makes $300 Million Deal for Big Machine Records June 30, 2019)</p><p>Prior to Universal's change, the industry's standard rerecording restriction said an artist can't rerecord until five years after the delivery of their last recording under the agreement, or two years from the end of the recording contract's term, whichever is later. Universal's new proposals increase those periods to seven and five years, respectively, and tack on another \"seven year post period\" to the end of the rerecording restriction during which the artist is barred from rerecording more than two songs.</p><p>Lawyers and executives say that prevents an artist from creating competitive recordings during a typical recording's biggest monetization period, usually within 10 years of its initial release.</p><p>Some of the other terms Universal has added to its contracts include increases in royalty payments to artists and more transparency into how royalties are calculated, said the person with knowledge of the contracts. Often, Universal's contract adjustments become industry standard because they are the biggest, lawyers and executives say.</p><p>Ms. Swift's early recording catalog was initially owned by her first label, Big Machine. In 2018, she signed with Universal Music Group's Republic Records, a deal in which any music she records—including the new versions of her old songs—remains her property, a perk historically reserved for the biggest superstars.</p><p>After unsuccessful attempts to buy her old recordings, she proceeded to rerecord her early catalog, and released a new version of her 2008 Grammy-winning album \"Fearless\" in April. It made its debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and has been streamed three times as much as the original since its release, according to MRC Data, formerly Nielsen Music.</p><p>But streaming data also show that enthusiasm around new releases from Ms. Swift—including last year's pandemic sister albums \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore,\" the former of which won \"Album of the Year\" at the 2021 Grammy Awards—has benefited her entire catalog, including her old recordings owned by Shamrock.</p><p>Although \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\" is generating many more streams than the original album, streams of the original haven't suffered, according to MRC Data. That is in part because those songs are embedded in playlists made on streaming services and benefit from the rise of nostalgia listening, which took off during the pandemic.</p><p>\"However many fans defected from old 'Fearless' to new, there appears to be just as many new listeners to old,\" said Nathan Hubbard, former Ticketmaster chief executive officer and co-host of the Ringer's \"Every Single Album: Taylor Swift\" series.</p><p>While streams account for the bulk of recorded-music income, licensing music to film, TV and advertisements provides a lucrative upside. Because Ms. Swift, as a songwriter, controls her publishing, she has steered licensees to her rerecorded songs, such as hit \"Love Story,\" which was used in a Match.com ad.</p><p>And when Ms. Swift spotted her 2014 hit single \"Wildest Dreams\" trending on TikTok, she rushed to put out her rerecord. \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)\" has been used in nearly 70,000 TikTok videos viewed over two billion times. The original has less than 7,000 videos.</p><p>\"Make it Taylor's Version pls,\" Ms. Swift captioned a TikTok post featuring a clip of the new recording.</p><p>Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com</p><p>As Taylor Swift Rerecorded Her 'Red' Album, Universal Reworked Contracts</p>",
