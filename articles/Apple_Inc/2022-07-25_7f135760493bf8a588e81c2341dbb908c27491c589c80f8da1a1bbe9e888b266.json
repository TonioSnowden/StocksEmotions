  "text": "<p>Read more: Mark Zuckerberg issues dire economic warning to Meta employees</p><p>When the company reports earnings Wednesday, expect to see the wrong kind of \"firsts\": Three months after reporting Facebook's first-ever user decline, Meta is expected to report its first ever year-over-year drop in revenue along with a profit decline of more than 30%. And the challenges go deeper than that: Facebook must whack its way through a corrosive thicket of major macroeconomic headwinds, the rising threat from TikTok for user attention, and lowered ad effectiveness as a result of Apple Inc.'s AAPL privacy changes.</p><p>From three months ago: Facebook earnings were not as bad as feared, but they were still pretty bad</p><p>The TikTok threat is so real that executives have decided the Facebook app should act more like the Chinese-owned social media app, with a change in how users browse the service. The app will open to a new Home tab that features a feed with photos, looping videos and status updates, not all of which will be posted by users' chosen \"friends.\"</p><p>Meta's woes have been accelerated by a contraction in digital advertising sales caused by inflation, the war in Ukraine, supply-chain issues and — perhaps, most troubling — Apple Inc.'s AAPL change to privacy mobile settings that has battered Meta's ability to collect consumer data. For an example of what this dangerous mix of headwinds can beget, you don't have to look farther than what happened to rival Snap Inc. SNAP last week.</p><p>\"We'd doubt much in the way of incremental Metaverse spending commentary but given the headwind it is creating, we think management would be well served to offer more specificity on where investments are going within the Metaverse initiatives as well as where cost cuts are coming out of between [metaverse] and the core business,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson said in a July 19 note.</p><p>Conversely, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju sees potential for \"better than-expected ad revenue growth on product innovation (Facebook Shops, Search in Marketplaces, etc.),\" he said in a July 19 note with an outperform rating and price target of $245.</p><p>\"Street models are too conservative and underestimate the long-term monetization potential of other billion-user properties like Messenger and WhatsApp,\" Ju wrote.</p><p>What to expect</p><p>Earnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average expect Meta to report second-quarter earnings of $2.55 a share, down from $3.61 a share a year ago.</p><p>Contributors to Estimize — a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, fund managers, company executives, academics and others — are also projecting earnings of $2.55 a share on average.</p><p>Revenue: Analysts on average expect Meta to report $28.92 billion in second-quarter revenue, down from $29.1 billion a year ago. Estimize contributors predict $28.92 billion on average.</p><p>Stock movement: Meta's stock has tumbled 50% so far this year — among the worst Nasdaq-100 NDX performers — while the S&amp;P 500 index  SPX is down 17%. Shares of Meta are down 8% since the company last announced quarterly results.</p><p>What analysts are saying</p><p>Zuckerberg's words of warning and hard pivot to the metaverse mark the latest dizzying narrative for a company already in the vice of regulatory scrutiny as well as roiled by the departures this year of several key executives that include Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Chief Revenue Officer David Fischer. The defections underscore Meta's myriad challenges during an economic downturn that has muzzled ad spending, Apple's restrictive policy, and in a climate of escalating competition short-form video services like TikTok.</p><p>\"Meta is losing its grip on its massive audience. Its U.S. user base for Facebook is barely growing, and while Instagram is helping to steady the ship, it too is starting to see softness in the important teen and young adult age groups,\" Insider Intelligence analyst Debra Aho Williamson said last week. \"Meanwhile, Meta's metaverse initiatives are also losing some steam as the company is forced to pull back and focus on the fundamentals of its business.\"</p><p>In slicing his price target to $275 from $300, Cowen analyst John Blackledge anticipates \"macro headwinds, shifting engagement to short-form video which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed or Stories for the time being and continued iOS ATT change impact\" will diminish Meta ad sales.</p><p>And yet, the enduring appeal of Meta's customer base of approximately 3 billion people and its steady ad revenue make it an attractive long-term investment, argue some. John Buckingham, editor of The Prudent Speculator newsletter, identified Meta as one of seven value stocks to buy now despite its operational risks.</p><p>\"It dropped from $400 to $160, so we like it,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook enters a storm of uncertainty, and the wrong kind of 'firsts' are showing up</p>",
