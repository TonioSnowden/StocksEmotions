  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Apple, Google Face Antitrust Probes in U.K.",
  "text": "<p>Separately, the CMA announced a traditional competition investigation -- which could lead to fines -- into conditions Google places on in-app payments in its mobile store.</p><p>That probe is similar to one the regulator opened into Apple's App Store last year.</p><p>The new investigations stem from a report by the CMA published Friday that said Apple and Google have an effective mobile-device duopoly that enables them to exercise what the regulator called a stranglehold over mobile ecosystems. Without intervention, the companies are likely to strengthen their positions in the sector, further restricting competition, the report said.</p><p>\"When it comes to how people use mobile phones, Apple and Google hold all the cards,\" said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's chief executive, adding that the companies' \"strong grip on mobile ecosystems allows them to shut out competitors.\"</p><p>Both companies said their practices promote competition and choice.</p><p>Apple said that it disagrees with some of the CMA's conclusions and that it aims to work with the British regulator \"to explain how our approach promotes competition and choice, while ensuring consumers' privacy and security are always protected.\"</p><p>Google said that it has \"reacted quickly to CMA feedback in the past\" and would continue to engage with the regulator.</p><p>The latest investigations add to a mounting tally aimed at big tech companies.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and some American states are investigating or have filed lawsuits against several large technology companies including Google and Meta Platforms Inc.</p><p>The European Union's top antitrust regulator has opened cases into Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
