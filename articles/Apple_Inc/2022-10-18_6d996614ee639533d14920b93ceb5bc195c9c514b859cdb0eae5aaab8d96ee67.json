  "title": "Technology:  Kanye West, Curbed  By Twitter, Reaches  Deal to Buy Parler  ----  By Gareth Vipers",
  "text": "<p>   Parler says Kanye West has agreed to buy the libertarian-leaning social network popular with conservatives, the rapper's latest foray into the debate around free speech. </p><p>   Parler's parent company, Parlement Technologies, said Monday it had entered into an agreement in principle with Mr. West, who now legally goes by Ye, to buy the platform. </p><p>   \"This deal will change the world, and change the way the world thinks about free speech,\" Parler Chief Executive George Farmer said in a statement. \"Ye is making a groundbreaking move into the free speech media space and will never have to fear being removed from social media again.\" Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to be completed later this year, weren't disclosed. Parlement and Mr. West didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   Launched in 2018, Parler has attracted millions of users by pitching itself as \"free speech Twitter alternative,\" several of them people who had been banned by other large social networks, including far-right talk-show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and supporters of the Proud Boys. </p><p>   The platform came under heavy scrutiny in 2021 for serving as a hub for people alleged to have organized and participated in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. </p><p>   Among other fallout, Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. removed Parler from their mobile-app stores, and Amazon.com Inc. stopped providing Parler with web-hosting services, forcing it offline for weeks. The major tech companies said Parler had broken their rules by failing to have an adequate content-moderation system in place. </p><p>   Last month, Google allowed Parler to return to its app store after the social network agreed to modify some of its content-moderation policies and enforcement. </p><p>   Mr. West has been critical of major Silicon Valley social-media companies. Earlier this month, Twitter Inc. locked his account after the musician and designer posted an anti-Semitic tweet. </p><p>   Mr. West's Instagram account also has been locked over a post that violated company policy, according to a spokesperson for Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc. </p><p>   Both Twitter and Instagram have policies that prohibit the posting of offensive language, among other restrictions. </p><p>   Mr. West has been enmeshed in controversy over his public messaging and social media before, including earlier this month when he appeared at his Yzy fashion show in Paris wearing a \"White Lives Matter\" shirt. </p><p>   The phrase, an inversion of \"Black Lives Matter,\" is often used by white supremacist groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League. </p><p></p>",
