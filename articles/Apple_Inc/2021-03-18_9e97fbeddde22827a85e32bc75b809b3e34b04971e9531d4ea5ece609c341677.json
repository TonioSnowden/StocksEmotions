  "text": "<p>\n  Here's are four new releases streaming this week: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' </p><p>\n  (Disney+) </p><p>\n  When Malcolm Spellman was growing up., he devoured comic books, and was drawn to Marvel titles, in part for their willingness to tackle issues of race, class and gender, \"whether they got it wrong or right.\" </p><p>\n  Now Mr. Spellman is the head writer for Marvel's \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" which premieres Friday. The series picks up not long after \"Avengers: Endgame,\" when Captain America offered Sam Wilson -- Falcon, a Black Avenger, played by Anthony Mackie -- his shield and the opportunity is to take up the Captain America role. But to Sam the shield feels as if it belongs to someone else. In the series, he teams up with Bucky Barnes's Winter Soldier, a formerly brainwashed assassin, played by Sebastian Stan. </p><p>\n  \"I showed up definitely excited about confronting whether or not a Black man should even want to be Captain America,\" Mr. Spellman says. \"On the Bucky side, I showed up wanting to dig deeper into what it feels like to basically be a person who has not only been at war for a hundred years, almost, but to have been manipulated through that whole thing. And then finally, for the first time, you are given space to really confront all that.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Calls' </p><p>\n  (Apple TV+) </p><p>\n  \"Calls,\" a new thriller that premieres Friday, is a collection of nine stories that take place during a global, apocalyptic event (and filmed during the coronavirus pandemic). Each story is a collection of phone calls, visualized with abstract visuals and transcriptions of the conversations, with the participants of the calls never seen. </p><p>\n  \"We really tried to describe very little so we leave a lot of room for imagination,\" says director Fede Alvarez, who created the series based on Timothee Hochet's French series of the same name. \"Whatever you imagine, it's always way more terrifying than I can create for you as an image -- most of the time.\" The cast includes Pedro Pascal, Rosario Dawson and Nick Jonas, among others. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'The United States vs. Billie Holiday'; 'Genius: Aretha' </p><p>\n  (Hulu, National Geographic) </p><p>\n  Screenwriter and filmmaker Suzan-Lori Parks has two new projects telling the stories of Billie Holiday and Aretha Franklin, two iconic American vocalists with different lives and legacies, each told through a different lens. </p><p>\n  \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday,\" streaming now on Hulu, focuses on the FBI's attempts to stop her from singing her song about lynching, \"Strange Fruit.\" </p><p>\n  \"When I was growing up, my mom and my dad would play Billie Holiday records in the house, and you could hear the pain in her voice,\" says Ms. Parks, who wrote the screenplay for the movie. \"My mom would always say, you know, quietly, like conspiratorially: 'Well, you know, they got to her.'\" And I was like: What does that mean?\" The movie stars Andra Day, who was nominated for an Oscar. Ms. Day won a Golden Globe for the role. </p><p>\n  Ms. Parks is also the showrunner on \"Genius: Aretha,\" the latest season in National Geographic's anthology series, which premieres Sunday and runs over four nights on the cable network (episodes air the next day on Hulu). The series features Cynthia Erivo in the title role. With \"Aretha,\" Ms. Parks says it's \"a different way of looking at somebody and a totally different character, too.\" </p><p>\n  \"I mean, Billie Holiday had difficulties early in life and just didn't have the support system that Aretha Franklin had. Aretha Franklin had difficulties in her life, but had . . . two Fs: faith and family, to help her through her difficult times,\" she says. </p><p></p>",
