  "text": "<p>Twitter is hardly the soaring condor of the digital advertising space. The US microblogging business garnered <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Final-Q4'21-earnings-release.pdf\">$4.5bn</a> in ad revenue last year — about <a href=\"https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2022/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Results/default.aspx\">4 per cent</a> of what Facebook owner Meta made. Google, for its part, pulled in <a href=\"https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/20220202_alphabet_10K.pdf?cache=fc81690\">$209.5bn</a>.</p> <p>But being a featherweight is not such a bad thing at the moment. Apple started rolling out a new privacy policy last April. This prevents apps from collecting data on iPhone users without their consent. That has made it much harder for companies to sell targeted advertising.</p> <p>Last week, Meta told investors Apple's privacy changes could cost it <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/03/facebook-fb-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcript/\">$10bn in ad sales</a> this year. Combined with concerns about increased competition from TikTok, this prompted investors to wipe more than $220bn from the company's market valuation.</p> <p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee2d7767-d55b-4656-9b29-cf7dfd4515df\">Twitter said</a> it had seen only a modest impact on its business. Revenue in the final three months of 2021 rose by more than a fifth to $1.57bn. The group is forecasting sales for the current quarter of between $1.17bn and $1.27bn — in line with consensus.</p> <p>Unlike Meta, Twitter makes most of its money from brand advertising. Targeted, or direct response, ads account for <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_downloads/2021/02/Twitter-Analyst-Day-2021-Transcript.pdf\">just 15 per cent</a> of its business. But there is a good reason for that. Twitter's data collection and advertising products are nowhere near as good as those of Meta. </p> <p>Twitter's modest exposure to direct ads is a positive at the moment. Longer term, it may need more of them to meet its ambitious goals of increasing annual revenue to $7.5bn and reaching 315mn daily users by the end of 2023. In other words, Twitter has to increase revenue by two-thirds and its user base by 45 per cent over the next two years.</p> <p>Pressure from activists such as Elliott Management has already led to the departure of co-founder Jack Dorsey. His successor Parag Agrawal is trying to win friends and influence investors with an expanded $4bn share buyback scheme. But what Twitter needs now — and has conspicuously lacked for so long — is a product or feature to lure a critical mass of users and revenues.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Twitter: weak ad proposition brings temporary advantage' FT.com 10 February.
