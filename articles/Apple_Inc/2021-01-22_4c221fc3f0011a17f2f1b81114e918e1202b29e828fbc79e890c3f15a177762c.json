  "text": "<p>A house sign is usually a finishing touch, often cut by lasers in a digitised font such as Ariel or Times New Roman. But discerningly designed and crafted letterforms can lend quality to the first impression of a house, the words not only revealing its name but a sense of place, age, material and proportion. </p> <p>It needs a certain talent, however. It is easy to commission a machine. It is a task of alchemy to hand-carve stone to bring letters alive.</p> <p>Iain Cotton does this in a converted stone barn down a country lane in a minor valley in eastern Somerset. He has dedicated the past 10 years to letter cutting, in which time his work in carefully restoring the incised historic street signs of Bath resulted in a recent Georgian Group Architectural Award, given to the Bath World Heritage Enhancement Fund.</p> <p>His airy workshop is lined with worked memorials and signs, large and small, of limestone and slate slabs. There are drawings pinned above them, some smeared with paint to test the legibility of colour and contrast.</p> <p>Cotton comes from Poynton in Cheshire, and had no interest in typography at school. But his technical drawing ability propelled him across the country to Norwich, where he did a drafting course, then back to Chester for an art foundation in 1983 with 3D design in mind. </p> <p>The tutors organised a field trip with a young landscape artist on the cusp of fame — Andy Goldsworthy — who encouraged the students to consider how natural materials become expressive through human arrangement. Cotton stacked rocks while his father, a practical newspaper printer, struggled to comprehend how a living could be made from it.</p> <p>Cotton moved near Bath, renowned for its fine stone, to be a sculptor. During the 1980s financial crisis he was lodging in the Royal Crescent and working as an apprentice stone conservator at Nimbus Conservation Ltd, one of whose partners was sculptor Laurence Tindall. </p> <p>One day at the city's famous Roman baths some vandals scaled the walls and pushed a statue of Julius Caesar off its pedestal. It was brutally damaged. Tindall got the job of cutting a replica of Caesar from Bath stone, and he needed some help. </p> <p>“He asked me if I'd done any figure carving,” says Cotton. Having cut one seated figure back at art school, the short answer was “yes”. The job took 12 weeks, and the process taught him about planning, measurement, proportion and precise cutting.</p> <p>The letter cutting started in 1995 when Tindall needed a memorial slab for a friend. Cotton looks back on that first effort as having “a naive charm”. The spirit of invention pervades letter cutting, but that creativity is guided by knowing which rules to respect and which to transgress. </p> <p>The master typographer and letter carver David Kindersley held that a bad space is worse than a bad letter. Cotton agrees.</p> <p>The contemporary letterforms can be found at the base of Trajan's Column in Rome, completed in AD113. Classical fonts derive from the proportions gleaned from that 1,900-year-old exemplar, based on circles within a square. </p> <p>In practice, the Romans were as wonky as their talents allowed, and many modern letter cutters see that end of the empire era as a time of magic, when old rules were transgressed.</p> <p>Cotton's modern inspiration is Ralph Beyer's genre-busting panels of biblical texts in primitively mannered capital letters lining the nave of Coventry cathedral, cut while it was under construction from 1958 to 1962.</p> <p>Breaking rules is artistic liberation, and Cotton felt free to interpret classical fonts when he “learnt that Romans set out their letters with brushes — the weight of the letter relates to the shape of the brush strokes,” he says. “I don't think our ideas about geometry would be understood by the Romans.”</p> <p>The street signs of Bath are a case in point. The spa town boomed through piecemeal 18th-century development beyond the tumbled medieval walls that once confined it. The character of the street signs reflects the different builders. </p> <p>In the past half decade, having cut the letters for streets including Gay Street, Spencers Belle Vue and Queen Square, Cotton sees in them a distinctively English manner and has developed a specialism in English vernacular letters, those that attempted to mimic printed type, such as serif font Caslon, but through irregularities added humane charm. He describes them as “indigenous”.</p> <p>He will often suggest an artfully skewed text for house signs. “They seem to me part of a local tradition of place making,” he says, “from the early 18th century until well into the second half of the 19th century. That was eclipsed in the 20th century by Eric Gill and his followers.”</p> <p>Gill, who taught the rebellious Ralph Beyer, was responsible for the simplicity of Gill Sans (1928), a typeface staple of retro mid-century boutiques. Its modern geometry suits digitised fonts and is still common today. </p> <p>But the biggest offender is Times New Roman, a typeface of large serifs designed by Stanley Morison in 1931 to make close-set small newsprint more legible. Ironically, it is routinely used for monumental architectural inscriptions around the world, infusing blandness.</p> <p>Iain Cotton reckons his purpose is to put the right letters in the right place. He says that carved lines are “like seeing a road or a path disappear round a bend or over a hill and thinking, I wonder where that goes?” </p> <p>He demonstrates that if you stop and look around you, letters imbue a sense of place as deeply as the sculpted landscapes, towns and houses that inhabit them.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
