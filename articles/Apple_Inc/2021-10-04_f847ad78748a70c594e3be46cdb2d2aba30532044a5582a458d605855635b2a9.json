  "text": "<p>Good evening from London,</p> <p>Winter is coming . . . and with it comes a new urgency to focus vaccination efforts on&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3439145a-80a4-47ad-9ceb-54a0cb707cf7\">vulnerable and vaccine-hesitant older people</a> rather than on booster shots and child vaccination campaigns.</p> <p>As our science reporter Oliver Barnes and chief data reporter John Burn-Murdoch explain, health authorities in the northern hemisphere are fearful that hospitals could start filling up with another wave of Covid-19 patients during the colder months, so they are starting to recalibrate their immunisation strategies as well as examining the efficacy of measures such as vaccine passports.</p> <p>Kevin Schulman, professor of medicine at Stanford University, has predicted that the next phase of the pandemic would be “a damn sight easier” in Europe than in the US because of high vaccination rates among the elderly. More than 3m Americans aged over 65 have yet to get their first jab, including nearly one in 10 of those aged over 75, leading to what President Joe Biden has termed the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b4ddb2b-929e-4b0b-b364-a9897d8f1a2d\">pandemic of the unvaccinated</a>”.</p> <p>Messaging is key. “We need to depoliticise the vaccine,” said Schulman. “The elderly groups that are not vaccinated are very focused on alternative media, which is delivering conflicting messages. We need to think about how we infiltrate that space with new messages.”</p> <p>Vaccine passports can still be useful tools. In France, they have given the hesitant “somewhere between a nudge and a shove,” said one expert.&#xa0; “Suddenly, people were faced with: go to a café, don't go to a café, go out for an aperitif, don't go out for an aperitif, go shopping, don't go shopping.” A new twist comes from Israel, where up to a million people could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1b2fd70-71b5-4e91-be0b-553b0e1e2639\">lose their vaccine passport</a> if they don't get a booster jab.</p> <p>Stark differences remain between rich western nations and developing countries, where talk of vaccine passports and booster jabs are a distant dream. A report today from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f110dc4-5802-472c-859f-6ac9adcdead3#post-0b4e5cfd-2fe3-4839-9c64-c959f6c37af5\">World Trade Organization</a>, while forecasting a huge increase in global trade, says that the longer this vaccine inequity persists “the greater the chance that even more dangerous variants of Covid-19 will emerge, setting back the health and economic progress we have made to date . . . Vaccine policy is economic policy — and trade policy”.</p> <p>The danger of new mutations rendering<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d88457da-6bbc-4f07-82a6-4738aa845492\"> existing vaccines</a> ineffective was also stressed by Ugur Sahin, chief executive of BioNTech, the company that worked with Pfizer to bring the first Covid-19 jab to market. He told the Financial Times: “We have no reason to assume that the next generation virus will be easier to handle for the immune system than the existing generation. This is a continuous evolution, and that evolution has just started.”</p> <p><em>Use our interactive </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\"><em>vaccine tracker</em></a><em> to compare country performance and generate your own charts</em></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Oil prices jumped to their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccd6f6d6-6045-4f0c-8638-9b0e01fee1c5\">highest level in three years</a> after Opec signalled it would maintain existing production plans</p></li>  <li><p>European Medicines Agency said Pfizer's booster shot could be used six months after a second dose for over 18s and older people with normal immune systems (Reuters)</p></li>  <li><p>International Air Transport Association predicted pandemic losses at airlines <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f110dc4-5802-472c-859f-6ac9adcdead3#post-7f285433-537d-400c-ae83-2dd2fcfef26a\">would pass $200bn</a> by the end of 2022</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f110dc4-5802-472c-859f-6ac9adcdead3\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Investors are gearing up for THE big event of the week: the <strong>US monthly jobs report</strong> — aka non-farm payrolls — and how it will influence the US Federal Reserve's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fba7824-ad14-46bd-a379-404e6b18abc0\">thinking on pandemic support</a>. “All roads this week point to payrolls Friday,” said a Deutsche Bank strategist. “Unless there is a marked deterioration across the whole sweep of labour market indicators within the report, this will probably be the catalyst to cement the November taper.” </p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>In his big speech at the Tory party conference, UK chancellor <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> announced measures worth £500m to help workers find jobs, but barely mentioned the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a03d3eba-2822-4818-8e10-76db2abf91dd\">supply chain crisis</a> that has hit the energy, fuel and food sectors. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30edf029-e121-43d5-9653-3cc7bbdc318c\">Pig farmers</a> are the latest group to protest at Brexit-related labour shortages. There's more here in our Big Read on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e93fab0-916e-4697-be8a-af02bde94411\">Britain's winter blues</a>. Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf has also taken aim at Sunak's <strong>Treasury department</strong>, branding it “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7890885b-89e8-45e8-bc70-5fa09ba35aea\">defensive and defeatist</a>”. </p> <p>From a veteran commentator to one at the other end of the spectrum. <strong>Covid's legacy</strong> will be an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5462084-f123-4bcf-b1a0-587b79a319b6\">economically more unequal world</a>, says Marc Kadir from Manchester Grammar School, the winner of the FT/Royal Economics Society Young Economist of the Year competition. <em>This article is part of the Financial Times free schools access programme. </em><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/schoolsarefree\"><em>You can get details and register here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Eurozone finance ministers are meeting today to discuss the <strong>energy price crisis</strong> amid fears it could knock back the bloc's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5805c3d0-f102-48fc-9cfb-d3b721b85c34\">recovery from the pandemic</a>.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's unconventional policy approach argues that high interest rates cause inflation rather than curb it.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is still fighting to get his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/072162f2-f1f8-4182-8d33-874bbcb1ba13\">spending bill</a> agreed by Congress. The proposals consist of $1.2tn for infrastructure and a more contentious $3.5tn for social security measures.</p> <p><strong>India</strong> is the latest country to be hit by the surge in energy prices. According to the country's power ministry, thermal power plants have just a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3ca4eaa-9ecc-4a81-ad53-4902fae4bd61\">few days of coal stocks</a> left to burn. In the umpteenth use of the “perfect storm” analogy in the past few weeks, a Nomura economist said: “You are caught in a situation where demand is high, your supply is low from the domestic side and you haven't restocked on inventories by importing.”</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong> has its new prime minister: Fumio Kishida of the Liberal Democratic party. His choice of Shunichi&#xa0;Suzuki as finance minister suggests the pandemic policy of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dfbd4da-344e-44b4-81ac-13daaebf5dea\">aggressive monetary easing and fiscal stimulus</a> will continue.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p><strong>Professional services </strong>is the latest UK sector to warn of labour shortages, which are causing some City of London firms to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93a72db1-92b6-4dae-8fc1-f1118f45d543\">turn away work</a> and triggering sharp pay rises. Demand for workers is so high now that the top job being advertised on LinkedIn is for recruiters to find candidates to fill vacancies.</p> <p>If you have your eye on that new <strong>iPhone 13</strong> then you might need to wait a little longer than usual. Covid-19 outbreaks have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13fe62e2-1e6e-4f9d-81d3-6a27d68d1171\">hit factories in Vietnam</a>, where the model's camera modules are assembled. Apple suppliers in China have also been affected by power outages as Beijing tightens control of energy consumption.</p> <p>US retailers have been, erm, spooked by shortages of freakish goods for <strong>Halloween</strong>, the traditional start of the long American shopping season, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b82c93-865b-40ad-85a2-17bd83ae10a0\">supply chain crisis</a>. Robert Armstrong in his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66777ec6-e230-44af-bc7c-c4f58302a0dc\">Unhedged newsletter</a> asks whether the ultra high profit margins reported by <strong>big retailers</strong> during the pandemic are sustainable. Investors are starting to conclude that “companies that did especially well in the last year and a half were not strategic geniuses”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66777ec6-e230-44af-bc7c-c4f58302a0dc\">he writes</a>. “They were lucky, and it will take more than luck to negotiate the coming months, as growth slows but supply problems persist.”</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>“<strong>Money isn't everything</strong>” is the increasingly common mantra of those turning their backs on unfulfilling jobs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/411faba8-3d75-4c71-86d2-5b1b308dfc9a\">writes columnist Pilita Clark</a>. Employers need to offer more autonomy, more recognition, more flexible hours, better holidays and anything that generally makes working life more enjoyable, she argues. </p> <p>One type of worker not too fussed about motivation is the automated kind. But despite the forward <strong>march of robots</strong> through warehouses and factories, many industries will remain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de7ccb13-7db5-4c17-a271-8860c36e73ee\">difficult to automate</a> for quite a while yet, says the FT editorial board. Labour shortages will have to be sorted by more traditional means such as improving&#xa0;pay and conditions&#xa0;and investing in training.</p> <p>Another group of workers not bound by eight-hour working days or five-day weeks are those in khaki. Management editor Andrew Hill looks at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1995345d-7aaa-48ed-afac-a5d49459443e\">skills offered by the army</a>, as <strong>Britain's forces</strong> are deployed to deliver petrol to forecourts. </p> <p><em>Get the latest worldwide picture with our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\"><em>vaccine tracker</em></a></p> <h1>And finally...</h1> <p>Hit TV series <em>Succession, </em>which returns shortly with its story of sibling rivalry in a media megacorp, may seem fanciful but its writers have plenty of real-life material to draw from, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fda23812-d724-4112-a5ec-78b836a89894\">writes Henry Mance</a>. “In&#xa0;<em>Succession</em>, history really does repeat itself, the second time as farce and much more enjoyable,” he says. </p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'Vaccination focus switches to the elderly' FT.com 4 October.
