  "text": "<p>You don't hear so many people talking about Big Pharma these days. The pandemic has left most sane people rather in love with pharma; the bigger the better as far as we are concerned. Frankly, there is no deal we would not wave through for an extra few million Covid-19 vaccines. And even when this pandemic is pushed back, we will all be gearing up for the next one or, hopefully, focusing on the more global concern of antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance. The only objection to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75029036-13f3-4ca2-8954-5a7207c0c3db\">Big Pharma</a> will be that it isn't Huge&#xa0;Pharma.</p> <p>This could be the first time an industry has ever shaken off the stigma of Big-ism — or Bigma as Big Branding likes to refer to it. Sure, there will still be good reasons to grouse, not least over price gouging, but right now we are cheering it on. The poster children for Big Pharma are no longer faceless execs or hard-hearted hedge-funders such as Martin Shkreli. They are the BioNTech couple, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6633221e-3b28-4a15-b02d-958854644c79\">Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci</a>, or the Oxford vaccine's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94670990-a638-4981-84d5-283185d433b7\">Sarah Gilbert</a>.</p> <p>All of which leaves a troubling vacancy for the global industry bad guys, the new Mr Bigs. You know, the type who are always at the root of the conspiracy in a certain type of movie thriller. The friendly, suave but ultimately terrifying chief executive who had hoped we could come to some arrangement but&#xa0;alas . . .</p> <p>So where might we look? Big Oil and Big Tobacco are on the way down, but Big Tech and Big Data have been competitive for a while now. They have all the key attributes: monopoly power, quite special amounts of hubris, global surveillance capacity, massive penetration into society and those early <em>Terminator</em> movies to point us in the right direction. Even so, there is no room for complacency; the Twenties should also open up opportunities for some new evil industries ready for the Big&#xa0;Branding.</p> <p><strong>Big Meat</strong>: This one is emerging as a really strong contender, being blamed not only for beastliness to, well, beasts but also for destroying the planet. Big Meat's most forward-thinking leaders are trying to get ahead of the science, studying lab-grown food and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24a94fb9-3f20-453e-a014-50b250991eec\">more sustainable farming</a>, but these are just the low-tar cigarettes of livestock. As long as there's a Big Mac, there's a Big Meat. Big Meat's henchmen are in every high street, reeling in youngsters with cheap food and relish. And let's not forget Big Meat's partner in crime, the dairy industry or Big Cheese. With the increased attraction of veganism and the ever growing salience of climate issues, these two are definitely ones to watch in the corporate global baddie stakes.</p> <p><strong>Big Wind</strong>: With the rush away from fossil fuels there is clearly scope for new evil energy consortia. They may even be the same evil energy consortia, if Big Oil can switch direction in time. It is admittedly hard to see the worst in this industry. Wind power just doesn't sound evil enough to be Big. But, that is its genius. Behind the innocent green credentials there are people threatening wildlife, deforestation and really ugly giant windmills. They are snapping up property for onshore turbines and power stations. The first Big Wind movie thriller starts with the sudden disappearance of the bird population and the murder of a twitcher who starts asking too many questions. In high-wind locations, the bad guys can be identified by their use of really powerful hair gel.</p> <p><strong>Big Box Set</strong>: A viciously addictive technology, also known as Big Bingewatch, which has spread virally into people's homes. Part of a global conspiracy, also linked to Big Delivery and Big PlayStation, that preyed on housebound citizens during lockdown, discouraging outdoor activity and building a dependency on meals and entertainment being brought to your door. The backlash against Big Box Set has already led to a move away from Netflix and Amazon, but these audiences were often hoovered up by foreign language film-makers known as Big Subtitle.</p> <p>We can't be sure which of these will take off. But the next Big Thing is already out there.</p> <p><em>Follow Robert on Twitter&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertshrimsley\"><em>@robertshrimsley</em></a><em>&#xa0;and email him at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=robert.shrimsley@ft.com\"><em>robert.shrimsley@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
