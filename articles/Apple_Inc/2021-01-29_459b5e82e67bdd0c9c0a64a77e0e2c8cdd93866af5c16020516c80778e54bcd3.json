  "text": "<p>(Riverhead, 323 pages, $28)</p><p>As she tended soldiers during the Crimean War, a British nurse found herself appalled by the wretched, vermin-infested conditions at the army's hospital in Istanbul. She began collecting figures showing the devastating effects of the filth and the dramatic benefits of the sanitary improvements she implemented. Her presentation on the need for cleaner care facilities, published in 1858, led to reforms that ultimately saved millions of lives and increased life expectancy in the U.K. Florence Nightingale, it turns out, was a pioneering data scientist.</p><p>Data, when used to reveal the value of hospital hygiene or the harm of tobacco smoke, can be a vital force for good, as Tim Harford reminds us in \"The Data Detective.\" But the very power of statistics -- the \"unreasonable effectiveness of data,\" as three Google scientists put it -- has also prompted a backlash, particularly as we've become aware of the potential for both honest confusion and deliberate abuse.</p><p>Mr. Harford, a British economist and journalist, hopes to persuade us not to give up on data, urging us to embrace thoughtful skepticism and avoid easy cynicism. As he expertly guides us through the many ways in which data can trick us, we see how difficult such an effort can be.</p><p>Imprecise and inconsistent definitions are one source of confusion. Our assessment of measures such as \"inequality\" can differ dramatically based on how such terms are defined. Even \"infant mortality,\" a key data point for public health, varies depending on the specific time in fetal development when the line is drawn between a miscarriage and a tragically premature birth.</p><p>Understanding data in context is also vital, Mr. Harford explains. British newspapers, fretting about gang violence, announced in 2018 that London's monthly murder rate had exceeded New York's. Yet open the aperture slightly and it turns out that the rates in both cities had declined over time and had reached a roughly similar low level -- good news, but apparently a less dramatic headline or perspective.</p><p>Then there is the problem of naive realism -- the tendency to overgeneralize from personal experience. New Yorker critic Pauline Kael may have known only one person who voted for Richard Nixon in 1972, but the president carried 49 states all the same. And seemingly objective metrics are often gamed: Rank colleges on selectivity and they'll work to inflate the pool of futile applications. \"When a measure becomes a target,\" a popular economics maxim warns, \"it ceases to be a good measure.\"</p><p>Even academic science, Mr. Harford notes, is beset by such problems. \"Publication bias\" encompasses the inclination of journals to favor a paper offering unexpected results rather than sturdier but less catchy ones. The findings of many well-known psychology studies -- showing, say, the effectiveness of \"power posing\" or the limitations of willpower -- have proved hard to replicate and may simply represent \"statistical accidents.\" Mr. Harford also recognizes the perverse incentives that can influence university researchers. \"If you have a result that looks publishable but fragile, the logic of science tells you to try to disprove it,\" he writes. \"Yet the logic of academic grants and promotions tells you to publish at once, and for goodness' sake don't prod it too hard.\"</p><p>Data may seem objective and pure, Mr. Harford notes, but information doesn't just appear, as if \"divine providence from the numerical heavens.\" Rather a data set begins with \"somebody deciding to collect the numbers.\" It behooves us to grasp how this was done: what data were collected, who was asked -- and who wasn't. For years after the thalidomide disaster, clinical trials excluded women of child-bearing age, potentially skewing results. Most psychology experiments involve so-called WEIRD subjects -- Western, educated people from industrialized rich democracies. Even \"big data\" approaches need to be scrutinized. Street Bump, an iPhone app designed to detect car-driving jolts and automatically report potholes in Boston, was abandoned after the maps that were generated \"favored young, affluent areas where more people owned iPhones and had heard about the app.\"</p><p>To learn from data, it's essential to present it well. For her analysis after the Crimean War, Florence Nightingale created one of the first infographics, using shrewdly designed diagrams to tell a memorable story. From the outset, she regarded visually compelling data displays as indispensable to making her arguments. With modern software, data visualization is remarkably easy; sharing images, Mr. Harford observes, is even easier. Unfortunately, he laments, the result has been a market for images that are emotionally engaging but not especially informative, prodding viewers to respond more with their hearts than with their heads.</p><p>Though numbers are at the core of \"The Data Detective,\" it's emotion that wields unreasonable power, affecting not only how we respond to data but also how we absorb it in the first place. We have a tendency, research reveals, to hear what we want to hear and to filter out what we don't. Richer information often doesn't help; it just provides more data that we can mine to support our original convictions. An authentically open mind can make a difference, Mr. Harford says, noting that the top forecasters tend to be not experts but earnest learners who constantly take in new data while challenging and refining their hypotheses. Data, Mr. Harford concludes, can illuminate and inform as well as distract and deceive. It's often maddeningly hard to know the difference, but it would be unforgivable not to try.</p><p>---</p><p>Dr. Shaywitz, a physician-scientist, is the founder of Astounding HealthTech, a lecturer in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.</p>",
