  "text": "<p>Ms. Waters has framed competition over new forms of central-bank money as \"a new digital assets space race.\" Unlike private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, a Fed-issued central bank digital currency would be backed by the U.S. central bank, just like the Fed backs physical currency.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated the central bank isn't in a rush, as it confronts inflation and a slowing economy. Mr. Powell has said it is more important to get the digital dollar right than to be first to market, in part because of the dollar's critical global role. He has also said the Fed won't issue a digital dollar without support from elected officials. The White House has largely remained neutral on a digital dollar, with President Biden ordering a study to determine its implications for issues such aseconomic growth and stability.</p><p>Ms. Waters, who chairs the financial services panel, has drafted legislation that would require the Fed to study a digital dollar, building on the central bank's existing work on the issue, and creating a process for the U.S. to potentially issue one in the future.</p><p>The idea faces stiff resistance. The banking industry generally says the costs of acentral bank digital currency outweigh any benefits and that it would directly compete with private bank deposits, making loans more expensive.</p><p>For about a century, the dollar has reigned supreme as the world's most important currency. There is now a serious debate about whether that status could be threatened by the march of technology and if, in response, the dollar needs to go digital.</p><p>A digital dollar could provide a new option to the way consumers pay for products and services. In addition to using a credit or debit card -- or Venmo or Apple Pay -- individuals would have a digital version of cash on their phones that could be used anywhere, likely through existing financial firms. That could lead to faster, cheaper and safer payments and make paper currency obsolete.</p><p>The shift could ease movement of money across borders, reducing fees on cross-border remittances. Advocates also say it could lead to faster and safer delivery of government payments, such as stimulus checks and unemployment benefits.</p><p>Some in Congress say the U.S. is already behind the curve. Among the Group of 20 major economies, 16 are in the development or pilot phase of a digital currency, according to the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. The European Central Bank, on behalf of countries including Germany and France, is exploring designs for a digital euro and preparing to launch a test pilot.</p><p>Mr. Hill, the Arkansas Republican, said his concerns were animated in part by China, which began real-world testing of its own central-bank-issued digital currency in 2020. In an interview, he said China's lending practices in the developing world could make it easier for the country to promote international uses of its digital currency -- a potential threat to the dollar-based global economy.</p><p>\"We should be concerned about China's predatory practices,\" he said.</p><p>Chinese authorities haven't ruled out international use of the e-CNY, the official name for the country's digital currency, but say it is designed for small-scale domestic use by consumers.</p><p>Analysts are looking for signs that the People's Bank of China will take concrete steps to join with central banks elsewhere to make it possible to use digital currencies between countries. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Some lawmakers say Congress ought to authorize a digital dollar, not just study it. \"I do feel some urgency because other countries are moving ahead,\" said Rep. Jim Himes (D., Conn.), in an interview.</p><p>---</p><p>James T. Areddy contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
