  "title": "Apple to Launch Self-Service Repair Program in Early 2022; Customers will be able to fix their own devices, starting with the mobile-phone display, battery and camera, using genuine Apple parts and tools",
  "text": "<p>Apple has been known for its tight control of the repair process, focused around Apple Stores and authorized service providers.</p><p>In July, as part of an executive order addressing consumer affairs, the Biden administration encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules barring electronics makers from restricting the use of independent repair shopsâ€”or people repairing their own devices.</p><p>Apple's program would be available first for the company's most recent iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups, and would then be followed by Mac computers running on Apple's M1 chips, the company said. Apple noted that the program is \"intended for individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices,\" and that most customers would still have to visit professional repair providers.</p><p>Self Service Repair is expected to be available early in 2022 in the U.S. before expanding to additional countries throughout the year, Apple said.</p><p>The company said in its release that it has been working on other ways to expand repair access.</p><p>\"In the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we're providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs,\" Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said.</p><p>Apple to Launch Self-Service Repair Program in Early 2022</p>",
