  "text": "<p>Your article “Hong Kong tries to lure back global talent” (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f48ce8b2-1baf-4ade-9857-138e93c8a17d\">Report</a>, October 20) was very timely. Hong Kong wants international investors to ignore the ruthless crackdown on freedom that has taken place since its national security law was imposed on the city in mid-2020. Indeed, the city's leader, chief executive John Lee, has himself been sanctioned by the US for his role in the crackdown.</p> <p>Businesses would do well to avoid Hong Kong. The destruction of freedom is anathema to the social and governance policies many espouse. Human rights concerns aside, the very real prospect that investments in Hong Kong will go to zero should give even the most hard-headed investor pause.</p> <p>Free and open international financial centres do not have political prisoners. Yet Hong Kong authorities arrested over 10,000 people on political charges after huge demonstrations in 2019. Research by the Hong Kong Democracy Council counts 1,163 political prisoners as of September 30. Many protesters are being held without bail and denied trials by jury. Independent media have been shut down — Lee personally signed the order putting the pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper out of business by freezing its bank accounts.</p> <p>Hong Kong was first, but Taiwan is next. President Xi Jinping on October 16 reaffirmed his intention to seize Taiwan by force if it does not surrender. A senior US Navy official last week warned that an invasion could come as soon as this year. US secretary of state Antony Blinken recently cautioned that Beijing has advanced the timetable to seize the island. Russia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in foreign businesses losing tens of billions of dollars on their Russian assets. Investments in Hong Kong are likely to suffer a similar wipeout in the event of a war in Taiwan.</p> <p>Businesses should pay attention now and not be lured in by Hong Kong's self-serving actions.</p> <p><strong>Mark L Clifford</strong> <br><em>President, Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation<br>Washington, DC, US</em> </p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this letter:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e348bb7a-13df-4c59-9cf8-af82a63a159d\"><em>I am still in Hong Kong, your letter writer is not / From Mike Rowse, Hong Kong</em></a></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Investors cannot ignore Hong Kong's rights record' FT.com 26 October.
