  "title": "Apple pauses sales in Russia, adding to its other actions related to Ukraine invasion",
  "text": "<p>The company also said it has limited Apple Pay and other services; stopped all exports into its sales channel in Russia; and is no longer making RT News and Sputnik News available in its App Store outside Russia. In addition, Apple AAPL has disabled both traffic and live incidents in Apple Maps in Ukraine as a precautionary measure for Ukrainian citizens, a company spokesman said in an email.</p><p>“We are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,” he said, adding that the company is continuing “to evaluate the situation and are in communication with relevant governments on the actions we are taking.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's president of global affairs said in a blog post that the company on Tuesday started blocking YouTube channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe. Kent Walker said that's in addition to the company's “indefinite pause” of letting Russian state media monetize content or advertise on any of its platforms.</p><p>Walker also said Google Pay “may become unavailable in certain countries” amid sanctions against individuals, regions and banks. He also wrote that Search, Maps, YouTube and other services provided by Google remain available in Russia, though he added that the company may take additional action as it continues to monitor the situation.</p><p>The companies' confirmation of their moves arrives after Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov urged Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and other tech companies — including Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGLGOOG Google, Meta Platforms Inc.'s FB Facebook, Netflix Inc. NFLX and Twitter Inc. TWTR — to stop doing business with Russia.</p><p>See: DirecTV will pull RT channel from its lineup</p><p>Also: FIFA suspends Russia from the World Cup ‘until further notice'</p><p>“Apple was starting to get called out for its lack of public response, given the broader effort in the hope that economic measures, including sanctions and private business decisions, might help to at least shorten the fighting,” said Irina Raicu, internet ethics program director for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California.</p><p>Tom Forte, an analyst for investment firm D.A. Davidson, said Tuesday that Apple and some of the world's other giant tech companies face a challenging situation.</p><p>“It's a challenge for them on one hand to try to maximize sales and profits and on the other hand try to be good corporate stewards, or do what they think is appropriate given the current conflict,” he said, though he added that he didn't think Apple would be materially affected by its decision to pause sales in Russia.</p><p>Apple's Russian subsidiary had revenue of 260 billion rubles in 2020, which is the equivalent of $3.1 billion, according to the most recent data from Statista.</p><p>Forte also said that given Cook's leadership and Apple's status as a leading global company, “Apple is well positioned for this debate” over corporate responsibility during a situation such as this, and possibly future global conflicts.</p><p>Calling Cook “part CEO and part diplomat,” Forte said the Apple CEO is one of executives “on the shortlist of who has the ear of the U.S. president and the head of China.”</p>",
