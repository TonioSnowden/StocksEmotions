  "text": "<p>Although I find Amazon's foray into book banning sad, I am heartened by what I hope will be the consequences: that other book sellers, like Apple, start to gain more market share, thus weakening Amazon's market power. As competitors grow stronger, Amazon may be protected from antitrust enforcement, which may be a good thing. Let us hope Amazon's strategy of strengthening its competitors in this way works, as I'm sure it intends.</p><p>Good luck with your book, Mr. Anderson. Now if I can only find where to get those discontinued Dr. Seuss books.</p><p>Daniel Roth</p><p>Richmond, Va.</p><p>---</p><p>When I searched for \"When Harry Became Sally\" on Amazon, one of the first items on the resulting list was \"Let Harry Become Sally: Responding to the Anti-Transgender Moment,\" by Kelly R. Novak. Amazon is featuring a book rebuttal (it got two stars) to a book that it is censoring.</p><p>Bart Levin</p><p>Carbondale, Colo.</p><p>---</p><p>As a boy, I identified my best reading material from the Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books. Where can I find this modern equivalent? Does Amazon publish one?</p><p>During the lockdowns, finding good reading is a treasure.</p><p>Lawrence Johnston</p><p>Monkton, Md.</p>",
