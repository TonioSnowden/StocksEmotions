The company's shares got a boost after rental group <strong>Hertz</strong> said it had ordered 100,000 Tesla Model 3 sedans to electrify its fleet.

You can still view it <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10123173/CEO-mysterious-firm-WUHAN-knew-Trump-deal-lives-1-4m-mansion-Florida.html\">here</a>. </p> <p>While Orléans-Braganza has a small stake in the Spac, the real beneficiary is an obscure Florida-based businessman called <strong>Patrick Orlando</strong>. </p> <p>He owns the Spac's sponsor, <strong>ARC Global Investments II</strong>, a little-known company that put up $25,000 to buy a stake in the blank cheque company.</p> <p>Orlando is involved with several other Spacs, including one headquartered in Wuhan, China, but in the years prior to his deal with Trump, the businessman was at times fighting legal battles against business associates and seems to have had a tough few years.</p> <p>“In trouble with bankers, wife, family, paying bills late . . . and gets worse every day,” Orlando wrote in a 2012 email. </p> <p>Now Orlando's stake in the Spac is worth about $600m.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Losing Pinterest</h2> <p>It's a bad habit of online shoppers to stuff their carts with items, often on discount, then forget to checkout. For <strong>Pinterest</strong>, the San Francisco-based social media and image sharing network, the feeling is familiar.</p> <p>For the second time in a year, Pinterest has been the target of takeover interest from a big Silicon Valley tech group, only to see the prospective acquirer lose interest over its lofty valuation and concerns with its slowing growth.</p> <p>In February the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f88b8474-e791-4efb-a9f6-54c8222680fe\">reported</a> <strong>Microsoft</strong> had taken a look at buying Pinterest but that the talks were no longer active. Last week the FT and others reported that <strong>PayPal</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/911cf6aa-031d-4119-8550-22d4e58737df#comments-anchor\">considering acquiring</a> Pinterest in a deal that valued the company at $45bn, or a 30 per cent premium. </p> <p>Before<strong> PayPal </strong>felt the need to say something publicly about the deal, shareholders rebuked whatever chief executive <strong>Dan Schulman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/398c5fa2-8ee5-4eaa-9fe7-04bb4ef996e5\">may have been thinking</a>. </p> <p>In the subsequent trading days, PayPal's value fell by almost $30bn, roughly equal to Pinterest's current market capitalisation. With good reason. </p> <p>While Pinterest benefited from the pandemic, as quarantined shoppers studied cooking recipes and artisanal home improvements, its lockdown-fuelled user growth is petering out. Its monthly active users in the US were down last quarter by 5 per cent, a number that is only accelerating. </p> <p>Headwinds are everywhere. Like other social media apps, <strong>Snapchat </strong>and <strong>Facebook</strong>, Pinterest is grappling with privacy changes <strong>Apple </strong>has implemented on its iPhone operating system. Last week Snapchat shares fell by more than a quarter as it warned of the impact of Apple's changes.</p> <p>After studying Pinterest, it's clear Schulman dreams of using PayPal's valuable stock currency to build an ecommerce platform.</p> <p>For now, Schulman, who is perhaps the valley's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/398c5fa2-8ee5-4eaa-9fe7-04bb4ef996e5\">most avid sweater wearer</a>, has loaded PayPal's shopping cart but failed to get past checkout. But rarely does one regret failing to pull the trigger on an ill-fitting cardigan from an online clearance rack.</p> <h2>Heady days in the buyouts business</h2> <p>Private equity firms <strong>Hellman &amp; Friedman</strong> and <strong>EQT</strong> have spent the past few months slogging it out to buy <strong>Zooplus</strong>, a German company that sells pet food online. </p> <p>A quick timeline might help illustrate how Zooplus has made the most of the situation. </p> <p>August 13: H&amp;F bids €390 a share. Zooplus's management and supervisory board back it</p> <p>September 2: Zooplus says it's in talks with EQT about a possible offer</p> <p>September 7: Zooplus says it's in talks with <strong>KKR</strong> as well as EQT about possible offers&#xa0;</p> <p>September 12: H&amp;F raises its bid to €460 a share&#xa0;</p> <p>September 15: KKR walks away</p> <p>September 25: EQT bids €470 a share&#xa0;</p> <p>October 8: H&amp;F matches EQT's €470-a-share offer</p> <p>That left the pair in deadlock — until Monday. &#xa0;</p> <p>H&amp;F and EQT have put their rivalry aside and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6884093e-4493-4a1b-ac75-b82eb83d193e\">agreed to bid</a> jointly for Zooplus. And just in case all that bidding wasn't enough, they've given their offer one last rise, to €480 a share. </p> <p>The attraction? Zooplus offers ample <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1dc4b105-2e49-4068-8d7c-46bb1f421b32\">scope for leverage and big spending</a>, the FT's Lex column notes, and sales have risen since more people bought pets during coronavirus lockdowns. </p> <p>It's rare for buyout groups to end bidding wars with an agreement to work together — though <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e66ae96-fc6d-421a-896b-d9cf77129a3f\">DD readers may recall</a> that <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>Global Infrastructure Partners</strong> did the same in February with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2dd2620-095d-4747-bd4c-b4d387b67614\">£3.5bn joint bid</a> for the UK-listed private jet services company <strong>Signature Aviation</strong>. </p> <p>But what's really rare in this case is the price. The transaction gives Zooplus an equity value of €3.7bn and an enterprise value of €3.5bn (in case you're wondering why the latter is lower, the equity value figure includes options, which are excluded from the enterprise value calculation).&#xa0;</p> <p>So the enterprise value is — don't fall off your chair — 57 times Zooplus's 2020 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. </p> <p>Oh, and the €480 a share is a casual 85 per cent premium. </p> <p>We've written before about how private equity groups are paying the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69c28c74-e957-4009-912a-aee1c452995d\">highest premiums in more than two decades</a> for listed companies, but even so, the European average is a more restrained 45 per cent. </p> <p>So is an 85 per cent premium going to be the new norm for take-privates? Listed company CEOs should perhaps take note when buyout groups next come knocking. </p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Chemicals group <strong>Linde</strong> has elected two board members, including the very busy former <strong>Siemens</strong> chief executive <strong>Joe Kaeser</strong>, to its board. Kaeser is chair of <strong>Siemens Energy</strong>, vice-chair of <strong>NXP Semiconductor</strong> and a director at <strong>Daimler Truck</strong>, where he is proposed to become chair. </p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>John McCormick</strong>, who co-runs <strong>Blackstone Alternative Asset Management</strong>, is leaving the business, the WSJ <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/co-head-of-blackstone-s-hedge-fund-business-to-leave-firm-officials-say-11635181025\">reported</a>. That makes<strong> Joseph Dowling</strong> the unit's sole head. </p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Cleary Gottlieb</strong> <a href=\"https://www.clearygottlieb.com/news-and-insights/news-listing/cleary-gottlieb-names-24-new-partners-counsel-and-senior-attorneys-2022\">has named 11 partners</a> to its top ranks. </p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> has hired <strong>Mollie Duckworth</strong> as a corporate partner in its office in Austin, Texas. She joins from <strong>Baker Botts</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Ropes &amp; Gray</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ropesgray.com/en/newsroom/news/2021/October/Ropes-Gray-Names-24-New-Partners\">named</a> 24 new partners. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Safe space </strong>Being a billionaire is so tough these days.
