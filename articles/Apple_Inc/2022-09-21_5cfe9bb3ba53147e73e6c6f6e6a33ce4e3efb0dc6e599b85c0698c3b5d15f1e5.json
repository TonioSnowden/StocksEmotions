  "title": "Fall's Coziest Beers for Drinking by the Fire Pit; With a low ABV and a nuanced flavor, mild is the style of beer to drink now. Here, our list of milds not to be missed.",
  "text": "<p>IN A COUNTRY with Flamin' Hot Cheetos and Double Stuf Oreos, Baconators and Big Gulps, a beer simply called \"mild\" would seem unlikely to generate much excitement. And yet, here in the U.S., the English mild style seems to be making a bit of splash—a sort of nuanced counterprogramming to the double dry-hopped IPAs and candy-coated pastry stouts that dominate the craft brewing scene.</p><p>\"Over the years, we've put a lot of energy into learning how to coax big flavor out of simple ingredients,\" said Matt Levy of Threes Brewing in Brooklyn, whose Theatre of the Absurd, made with all English ingredients, clocks in at a meager 3.5% ABV. \"Dark milds demand restraint and a deft touch but reward with rich flavor.\"</p><p>The term \"mild\" was originally used in 19th-century Europe to denote fresh, un-aged beer, regardless of style. Today, it generally means dark-colored, malt-forward beers in the 3-3.5% ABV range. Though these sessionable beers don't feel watered-down, they've never exactly caught on in the bigger-is-better American craft beer scene. Recently, however, they have gained a foothold on the East Coast—as an ideal sipper for easing back into society during the pandemic era.</p><p>\"Milds can provide thought-provoking sips to wade through the nuances of high-quality ingredients and process,\" according to Sean Towers, co-owner of the Seed: A Living Beer Project, which opened in Atlantic City, N.J., in August 2020. \"Or they can simply be an accessory, without a second thought given to them other than: This is enjoyable [in] a comfortable atmosphere shared among friends.\"</p><p>If you're one for wading through the nuances, you might also be the sort to commit to the 20-ounce pub glass emblazoned with \"MILD\" sold by Forest &amp; Main Brewing Company. At the brewery's Ambler, Penn., tap room, you can fill it with Poor Yorick, a dark mild delivered at cellar temperature courtesy of a hand-pumped cask via a British-style beer engine.</p><p>\"Mild was always one of the beer styles we just loved to drink ourselves,\" said co-owner Gerald Olson. The fact that many Americans didn't yet get it was hardly a deterrent. \"In some ways maybe that's part of its allure, what makes it feel special,\" Mr. Olson explained. \"But the people who are into it really love mild.\" Indeed, that 20-ounce glass often sells out. (You're more likely to come across American milds packaged in the same 16-ounce \"pounder\" cans that might typically hold a hazy IPA or fruited sour beer.)</p><p>\"We've been making milds since we opened,\" said Sam Masotto, owner of Bonn Place Brewing, which launched in Bethlehem, Penn., in 2016. \"They were never a popular thing. But they did well for us.\" Today Mr. Masotto brews several milds. \"I think they are trending now due to palate fatigue,\" he said. \"The term 'mild' evokes a low-alcohol beer.\"</p><p>Yet, in a world awash in bland hard seltzers and indistinguishable \"lite\" lagers, beer drinkers should not presume that mild means boring. \"Milds are like comfort food,\" said Mr. Levy. \"In my opinion there's no better shoulder-season beer style to get you from summer into autumn.\"</p><p>BEER HUGS / Cozy, British-style Mild Ales </p><p>PHOTO: F.
