  "title": "U.S. Crackdown on Juul and Smoking: What to Know; FDA has proposed several rules that would mark the biggest effort to curb smoking since the 1998 deal with tobacco industry",
  "text": "<p>How many Americans smoke cigarettes?</p><p>The cigarette smoking rate has been declining in the U.S. for decades, though it rose slightly in 2020 when the pandemic hit. About 12.5% of adults in the U.S., or 30.8 million people, were cigarette smokers in 2020, the latest data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. cigarette sales were $99 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International.</p><p>Why are there suddenly so many changes around cigarettes and e-cigarettes?</p><p>Some of the proposals have been in the works for decades and are part of a broader effort by the Biden administration called the Cancer Moonshot initiative, which aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration gained regulatory control over the cigarette industry in 2009, and it has been funding studies to form the basis for new policies such asreducing nicotine levels in cigarettes and banning menthol-flavored cigarettes and cigars. The FDA asserted regulatory authority over e-cigarettes in 2016 and is conducting a review of all vaping products on the U.S. market.</p><p>Why does the FDA want to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes?</p><p>FDA officials said this week they plan to propose a rule that would require the elimination of nearly all nicotine in cigarettes sold in the U.S. It would take several years for such a change to take effect.</p><p>The goal of the policy is to prevent future generations from becoming addicted to cigarettes and to help current smokers quit or switch to less-harmful alternatives. The policy is based on government-funded research showing that when people use cigarettes with about 95% less nicotine than a typical cigarette, they smoke fewer cigarettes and become less dependent on them. Tobacco companies dispute those studies.</p><p>What is nicotine? And how do you make a cigarette without it?</p><p>Nicotine is the addictive chemical in tobacco that hooks people on cigarettes. Nicotine itself doesn't cause cancer or lung disease, according to the FDA. Those diseases are caused by other harmful constituents in cigarette smoke.</p><p>Companies have made low-nicotine cigarettes by stripping nicotine from the tobacco leaf in a process similar to the way coffee companies make decaffeinated coffee. They have also experimented with tobacco-leaf treatments and plant breeding to develop tobacco varieties that contain less nicotine, industry executives say.</p><p>22nd Century Group Inc., a Buffalo, N.Y., biotechnology company, uses genetic engineering to grow tobacco with about 95% less nicotine than a typical tobacco plant.</p><p>What is changing with menthol cigarettes?</p><p>The FDA is also pursuing a ban on menthol cigarettes, which account for more than a third of all cigarettes sold in the U.S. The FDA in April published a proposed rule on menthols and is now soliciting public comments. That ban also likely wouldn't take effect for several years.</p><p>Menthol cigarettes create a cooling sensation in the mouth and throat. Health officials say that eases the throat irritation caused by cigarette smoke, making menthols more appealing to young people and people who have never smoked. Menthols are harder to quit and likely pose a greater health risk than regular cigarettes, the FDA says.</p><p>U.S. health officials say a menthol ban would reduce youth initiation and address health disparities across racial groups. In the U.S., 81% of Black smokers used menthols in 2020, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Black people in the U.S. die at a higher rate than other groups from smoking-related cancers, according to CDC research.</p><p>What do cigarette makers say?</p><p>Tobacco companies say they support the goal of switching cigarette smokers to smoke-free products such as e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches, but disagree with the nicotine reduction and menthol moves. They could sue to block or delay the policies.</p><p>Cigarette makers say that the nicotine-reduction policy might not be effective in helping people quit, that it could fuel a surge in demand for black-market cigarettes and that reducing nicotine to very low levels isn't achievable on the scale of billions of cigarettes a year. If the policy were effective, they say, it could hurt U.S. tobacco growers and retailers.</p><p>Cigarette makers also have disputed the FDA's conclusions on the health effects of menthols. Newport maker Reynolds American Inc. has funded opposition efforts led by prominent Black community leaders. They have said menthol bans would expand the illicit market for cigarettes and lead police to racially profile Black smokers. The American Civil Liberties Union and some members of the Congressional Black Caucus have expressed similar concerns.</p><p>What is happening with Juul? Is it still available?</p><p>The FDA ordered Juul Labs Inc. to take its e-cigarettes off the U.S. market, saying the company hadn't submitted sufficient evidence that its devices were safe. The order followed a nearly two-year review of data presented by the vaping company, which sought authorization for its tobacco- and menthol-flavored products. The FDA told retailers to remove Juul's products and advised consumers to seek alternatives.</p><p>When Juul landed in the FDA's sights four years ago, the startup's fruity flavors and hip marketing were blamed for fueling a surge of underage vaping. The company since then has been trying to regain the trust of regulators and the public. It limited its marketing and in 2019 stopped selling sweet and fruity flavors. Juul asked a federal appeals court to temporarily block the FDA's order.</p><p>Why did the FDA ban Juul?</p><p>The FDA said that it wasn't aware of a hazard associated with using Juul devices but that the company hadn't submitted sufficient evidence that its devices were safe. Some of the research Juul submitted to the agency raised concerns because of insufficient and conflicting data—including information on potentially harmful chemicals leaching from the company's refill pods into the nicotine liquid they contain, the FDA said.</p><p>Juul said that it disagreed with the FDA's findings and that it had provided ample data to the regulator.</p><p>Will other vaping products be available?</p><p>The FDA has authorized tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes made by Reynolds American Inc., NJOY Holdings Inc. and Japan Tobacco International. Reynolds e-cigarettes are sold under the Vuse brand.</p><p>The agency has ordered off the market more than a million flavored products, including vaping liquids with flavors such as apple crumble, cola and cinnamon toast cereal.</p><p>In an effort to curb youth vaping, the FDA in 2020 temporarily halted the sale of sweet and fruity e-cigarette refill cartridges. Manufacturers were allowed to submit those products for the agency's permission to resume their sales.</p><p>Is vaping still popular among teens?</p><p>About 11% of U.S. high-school students—an estimated 1.7 million teens—said they had used e-cigarettes at least once in the past 30 days, according to a national survey conducted online in early 2021.</p><p>That was down from 2020, when about 20% of U.S. high-school students, or about 3 million, said they had used e-cigarettes at least once in the past 30 days. The U.S. has raised the tobacco-purchase age to 21.</p><p>U.S. Crackdown on Juul and Smoking: What to Know</p>",
