  "title": "A Fall Weekend Getaway in the Pacific Northwest—Easy and Gorgeous; For a long weekend of fine meals, farm visits and outdoor excursions a-plenty, chart a course to the Columbia River Gorge. We've plotted the ideal itinerary for you.",
  "text": "<p>THE COLUMBIA RIVER, which delineates the border between Oregon and Washington state is set in a gorge of surpassing drama and beauty. It's the result of a little-known period of American geo-history, when the glacial ice-melt in prehistoric Lake Missoula periodically sent walls of water up to 1,000 feet high and moving at 60 miles an hour along the path that's now the Columbia. Portlanders seeking a recreational getaway have long made the area a destination, particularly the town of Hood River which, thanks to high winds, is one of the world's best spots for kiteboarding, kite-surfing and the new trend of winging.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your favorite way to spend a weekend in the Pacific Northwest? Join the conversation below.</p><p>But lately both the Oregon and the Washington sides of the river (which together comprise a distinct region of its own, surrounded by rich agricultural soil) are being transformed by folks who come for the nature but stay to find new ways of preserving it responsibly. Farmers, bakers, vintners, brewers and hotels that tout their low-carbon footprints or natural-wine lists are joining the older natural-foods and agricultural players in the Gorge.</p><p>Nate Ready, co-owner and winemaker of Hiyu Wine Farm in Hood River, founded in 2011, even claims that the land has a mystical quality. \"It's more expansive than the physical space would seem to indicate.\" We mapped the physical space anyway, via a long-weekend road trip crossing back and forth between Oregon and Washington. Right now it's pear and apple season, and a glorious time for fall foliage. Wildflower tourism begins in May. Berries start in June. But really, anytime during spring, summer or fall, the gorge is gorgeous.</p><p>Day 1 / Friday</p><p>2 p.m. At Portland International Airport, even the rental-car clerks promise you'll have a rad, epic, sweet time. Set your GPS for the town of Troutdale, where the sign over the highway announces the \"Gateway to the Gorge.\" A quick walk down Main Street reveals a leaping-trout fountain, a storefront \"City Hall\" and good coffee from a place named Good Coffee (336 E Historic Columbia River Hwy).</p><p>3 p.m. The next road-tripper stop is a 1920s gas station repurposed as the Sugarpine Drive-In. You're here for an ice-cream sundae: swoopy soft-serve creations piled with flavored rubble such as brown-butter blondies and pine-nut honeycomb crunch (1208 E Historic Columbia River Hwy). </p><p>PHOTO: Aly Miller</p><p>3:30 p.m. Sugarpine sits on the Historic Columbia River Highway, America's first scenic highway, once abandoned but now reopened to cars on certain stretches and to only pedestrians on others. The auto-bound can cruise it from Troutdale to Cascade Locks, stopping at the Vista House overlook for a tremendous view and at Bridal Veil Falls for a half-mile waterfall hike.</p><p>4:30 p.m. Cross the Columbia River where the Pacific Crest Trail does, on the 1926 steel-truss cantilever Bridge of the Gods. Watch the hikers make their way along the narrow roadway among the cars.</p><p>5 p.m. Route WA-14, the Lewis and Clark Highway, hugs the shoreline on the less-discovered Washington state side of the river. RubyJune Inn on the outskirts of White Salmon, where you'll be bunking for the night, exemplifies the area's old-meets-new percolation. Owners Chris Wiggins and Gretchen Wolf have five serene guest rooms appointed with Kilim rugs and natural elements, and they've turned an 1890s ice house on their property into a lounge (from $175 a night).</p><p>7 p.m. Drive 12 minutes from RubyJune to restaurant row in White Salmon, the fast-changing town on the Washington side of the border. Choose among upscale bistro Henni's Kitchen &amp; Bar (120 E Jewett Blvd.), Everybody's Brewing, whose pub-grub is mostly housemade (177 E Jewett Blvd.) and authentic Pixán Taqueria &amp; Cantina (216 E Jewett Blvd.).</p><p>Day 2 / Saturday</p><p>8 a.m. After breakfast at RubyJune, load up the car. You're decamping for the Society Hotelin Bingen, Wash., where you'll check in this evening. Set on the bank of the Columbia River opposite the mouth of Hood River—one of the Columbia's many tributaries—the Society is only a 15-minute drive from RubyJune, but it's a better base for crisscrossing this section of the waterway. Be sure to bring singles: The $2 toll for the Hood River-White Salmon Interstate bridge will be a daily ding from now on. From the bridge you'll see the wind-sport scene off Hood River Waterfront Park, which on nice days is a butterfly-swarm of colored sails. Wind-sports aren't something to learn in a weekend, but most anyone can eBike, and Sol Rides runs well-informed guided tours. The 3-hour \"Twin Tunnels\" ride pedals the portion of the scenic highway that's closed to cars.</p><p>1 p.m. In the town of Hood River, French Laundry meets Oregon-style regenerative agriculture at the Hiyu Wine Farm, whose wine-pairing lunch is served in a tasting room wrapped in a \"Sleeping Beauty\" snarl of foliage. Winemaker Nate Ready grows nearly 120 grape varietals arranged by theme (3890 Acree Dr.).</p><p>3 p.m. The Hood River runs from the snow-covered volcanic cone of Mount Hood to the Columbia River, bisecting the agricultural powerhouse of the Hood River Valley. The Hood River Fruit Loop is a 35-mile trail with 36 stops for U-pick farms, farm-stands, vineyards and more. Stop by Apple Valley Country Store for a milkshake made from huckleberries (2363 Tucker Rd.) and Kiyokawa Family Orchards (5625 Hutson Rd.), which has one of the valley's largest U-Pick orchards. The current farmer's parents at this family-owned, third-generation business met in a Japanese internment camp during World War II.</p><p>5 p.m. You've been out all day, so what better time to dine in? Your accommodations at the Society Hotel in Bingen will include a kitchenette with a minifridge, hot plate and cooking utensils. On your way back through Hood River, stock up on supplies at the new Treebird Family Market (106 Hwy. 35). In Treebird's parking lot, the Wild Columbia Salmon \"Native Fish\" standrepresents the contemporary Native American fishing scene in the region (members of the Yakama, Umatilla, Nez Perce and Warm Spings tribes all fish in the area). Employees show off beautiful wild-caught salmon in ice-filled coolers (106 Hwy. 35).</p><p>6 p.m. You finally check into the utopian Society Hotel. Located on the premises of a former school building, it offers resource-saving—but high-design—\"hostel\" accommodations in rooms of shared bunks. (You won't find a cooler hotel basketball court anywhere). But you've booked one of the more luxurious \"cabin\" rooms, appointed in natural wood; they surround the spa, whose outdoor pool offers views of the fall-tinted mountainside (cabins from $169 a night).</p><p>Day 3 / Sunday</p><p>8 a.m. Drive four minutes west from Bingen to downtown White Salmon to join the line of people at the White Salmon Baking Company, an innovative bakery, breakfast and lunch spot that cooks with farm-fresh produce and naturally leavens its bread with wild yeast (80 NE Estes Ave.).</p><p>8:30 a.m. For athletic types, a rugged, 7-mile, 2,800-vertical-foot climb up the side of Dog Mountain, 20 minutes west of Bingen on WA-14, traverses shady forest and banks covered with wildflowers (in springtime) until the final rocky scramble to the top. (Estimated round-trip for an average hiker is four hours.) The less-committed can stroll a block from the hotel to Bingen's mellow main drag. The curiosity-stuffed Antiques &amp; Oddities represents Bingen's old guard (211 W Steuben St.), while tarot cards and new-age treasures at the just-opened Moon Mountain Highwayshop represent the new (113 W Steuben St.). </p><p>Yogurt plum cake at the White Salmon Bakery Company, an innovative bakery, breakfast and lunch spot that cooks with farm-fresh produce and heirloom varietals. PHOTO: Miles Fortune for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>1 p.m. About a half-hour from Bingen or 15 minutes from Dog Mountain, the family-owned Big River Grill in Stevenson, Wash., will satisfy shoppers or hikers alike with an eclectic lunch menu in a room hung with fish paintings and vintage signs (192 SW 2nd St.).</p><p>2:30 p.m. In a winemaking region that is highly experimental, Michael Savage, vintner and owner of Savage Grace Wines, makes old-world-style wines. Taste them on his outdoor patio, with views of the distant river far below (442 Kramer Rd.).</p><p>5 p.m. After some downtime at the hotel, cross the bridge back into Oregon to the Hood River Waterfront Park. The move here is to buy a bottle of beer from the outside window at pFriem Family Breweries (707 Portway Ave.) and, since Hood River has no open-container law, sip it outdoors while watching the wind-johnnies on hydrofoils catch the breezes as the end of the day.</p><p>6 p.m. Take a two-minute drive to downtown Hood River to a complex at 504 Oak Street housing Mike's Ice Cream and the Ruddy Duck clothing store, owned by windsurfer Mike Kitts. You're here to browse the Hood River Common House, a bottle shop and wine bar just opened by Mr. Kitts's three children (110 5th St.).</p><p>7 p.m. Dine a few blocks from the Common House at Celilo Restaurant and Bar, which serves seasonal regional fare. The restaurant name is a tribute to the ancient native fishing grounds at Celilo Falls, once located 35 miles upriver but inundated when The Dalles Dam went into operation in 1957 (16 Oak St.). </p><p>Wild Columbia Native Fish Stand, in Hood River, Ore., offers wild-caught salmon. PHOTO: Miles Fortune for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Day 4 / Monday</p><p>8:30 a.m. Departure day will be action-packed. After breakfast at the hotel, head east on WA-14, about 30 minutes toward The Dalles, one of the area's larger towns, which marks the easternmost end of the Gorge. You're visiting Columbia Gorge Discovery Center &amp; Museum, whose grounds were created to display the native-species flora that would have been around when Lewis and Clark came through (5000 Discovery Dr.).</p><p>11 a.m. Another of the Columbia's tributary rivers, the White Salmon, is an especially beautiful one. You'll meet your guides from River Drifter at their White Salmon location for a 2.5-hour paddling excursion in teal-green ice melt through canyons and past old-growth forest (856 WA-141). You'll navigate challenging but fun rapids, and trips are appropriate for most skill levels.</p><p>2 p.m. Pin-drop for Portland. Dawdlers could stick around for the Monday wine and pizza night at the White Salmon Baking Company, a de rigueur evening for food-obsessed locals, but since the bakery has one of the area's best wine lists, you'd have to take Tuesday off, too.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
