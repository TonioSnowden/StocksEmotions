  "title": "Venture Investor Playground Global Makes Bigger Healthcare Push; Firm expects life sciences investment to play a larger role in next fund",
  "text": "<p>Playground formed in 2015 and trained its $300 million debut fund on sectors such as robotics and automation, said General Partner Jory Bell.</p><p>The firm has backed technology companies such as Agility Robotics Inc., a developer of robots designed to work alongside people in warehouses, which disclosed a $150 million financing in April.</p><p>Since 2017, investing through its $500 million second fund, Playground has also backed life sciences companies because of the opportunity the team saw emerging to apply technology in areas such as engineering biological systems, Mr. Bell said. The firm in late 2017 invested in Ultima, which operated quietly until May when it said it had raised about $600 million in venture capital to advance its DNA-sequencing technology, according to Mr. Bell.</p><p>As technologists with a background in operating companies, the team is comfortable betting on novel technologies, he added. Mr. Bell, for example, worked for Apple Inc. designing laptops and later founded a computer hardware and software manufacturing company.</p><p>Life sciences investments make up about 20% to 25% of its second fund. That percentage could rise to about 33% with a new $500 million fund Playground is raising, Mr. Bell said.</p><p>Since 2020, Playground has added Phyllis Whiteley, who has a doctorate in pharmacology and has held roles at life sciences companies such as Roche Holding AG, and Benjamin Kim, who has a doctorate in bioengineering and biomedical engineering, to help it make healthcare deals.</p><p>Playground has been concentrating on companies that make life sciences tools, such as Ultima, which says its technology enables a genome to be sequenced for $100, and therapeutic platform startups, which have potential to discover their own drugs, Mr. Bell said.</p><p>Playground in 2020 led a seed investment in Boston-based Manifold Biotechnologies Inc., better known as Manifold Bio, whose technology is designed to enable better use of animal studies in drug development. Manifold, which is developing cancer treatments, attaches a string of amino acids to experimental drugs that serves as a bar code for each compound, according to co-founder and Chief Executive Gleb Kuznetsov.</p><p>This bar coding helps researchers determine whether a drug is selectively targeting a tumor or veering off into healthy tissue, according to Dr. Kuznetsov. That aids the search for the most-promising drugs to move into clinical trials, he added.</p><p>Playground's mentorship has been beneficial to Manifold and the firm also supported the company as it raised a $40 million Series A round of financing that the company just closed, Dr. Kuznetsov said.</p><p>Manifold's approach \"resonated as a potential huge accelerator of progress in protein therapeutics,\" said Jeff Huber, general partner of Triatomic Capital, which led the Series A round.</p><p>Playground in 2020 also led a seed financing in Lassogen Inc., a San Diego-based biotech startup seeking to develop drugs for cancer based on molecules called lasso peptides that bacteria produce. These compounds could combine the benefits of conventional, small-molecule drugs, which are taken as pills, and biological drugs such as antibodies that must be injected, said founder and CEO Mark Burk.</p><p>\"Playground has been instrumental in serving as an early-stage investor and seeing the potential of the technology,\" Dr. Burk said.</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p>",
