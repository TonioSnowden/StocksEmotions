  "title": "Aiming High — the rise of Masayoshi Son and SoftBank",
  "text": "<p>Like many entrepreneurs, Masayoshi Son was born an outsider with a point to prove and a relentless determination to succeed. Raised in a poor Korean family who had originally migrated to Japan hidden in the hull of a small fishing boat, Son grew up in a highly hierarchical society with few opportunities. But thanks to his natural intelligence, ferocious hard work, quirky charm and happy knack of anticipating the next technological trend, Son has emerged as one of the world's most influential investors. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4403ee1a-050f-4742-b967-ba47b0f1de03\">SoftBank Group</a> he founded in 1981 now ranks among Japan's five most valuable listed companies, owning stakes in many market-leading tech firms.</p> <p>To Son's mind, the disadvantages of birth gave him advantages in life. “The cards I was dealt meant I started at a deficit compared to everyone else, but in the end that proved an extraordinary source of inspiration and energy to go on and do the impossible. I am beyond thankful to God for that gift,” Son tells the author Atsuo Inoue, a Japanese writer who has been tracking the businessman for more than 30 years.</p> <p>At times, <em>Aiming High</em> resembles a somewhat clunky Balzac novel recording the improbable rise of a risk-taking provincial hero as he woos his future wife, skirts with failure, survives chronic hepatitis and builds his fortune. At the age of 19, Son wrote a 50-year life plan to build a business empire. Now 45 years later, aged 64, he still regiments his life, dividing his daily diary into five-minute blocks. So hard did he work as a young man in the US that he twice turned up late for his own wedding. In Inoue's telling, we learn that Son is: “Round of face, baby-faced even. Friendly of expression. Short of stature. Completely boundless in energy. Occasionally explosive of temperament.”</p> <p>Inoue makes the most of the access he was given to Son and his associates and the book is studded with telling quotes and anecdotes. But that proximity to his sources comes at a cost: denying the author much sense of perspective. Almost all of Son's sweeping assertions are taken at face value. There is little scrutiny of Son's dealmaking record or the notoriously aggressive tactics his Vision Fund managers use to secure their deals. More space is devoted to explaining why <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7938752a-52a7-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f\">WeWork</a> will eventually come good as an investment than to reflecting on the striking flaws in the office leasing company's business model, which famously came unstuck in 2019.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the story Inoue tells is impressive and inspiring. In spite of his humble origins, Son won a place at University of California, Berkeley in the late 1970s when the computer revolution was beginning to reshape the world. Son was quick to understand technology's possibilities and even quicker to befriend some of its leading minds, including Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. He was equally deft in spotting opportunities in the internet and smartphone revolutions, snapping up the Vodafone Japan and Sprint mobile phone businesses and investing heavily in China's Alibaba.</p> <p>His vast Vision Fund is now betting billions on the AI revolution. The fund has invested in 164 tech companies, stuffing many of them with far more capital than most traditional venture capital firms would ever do. Some rivals have described this approach as a “foie gras” strategy — force-feeding ducks to fatten their livers. “AI is the most incredible thing humans have ever made and I am fully prepared to throw everything I've got behind it,” Son says.</p> <p>For the non-Japanese reader, Inoue provides some fascinating insights into the country's culture and society through Son's lived experience. But Son's conviction that he could propel Japan into the future by building world-beating information infrastructure does not appear to be panning out as intended. Far from leading the AI revolution, Japan is lagging a long way behind the US and China. Nor is it certain that Son will be able to fulfil his dream of creating a durable business empire that will last for centuries. Without Son's magnetic pull, it is hard to see how SoftBank will cohere.</p> <p>Still, Son insists we should keep our eyes fixed on the future, looking 100, 200 or 300 years ahead rather than paying too much attention to the passing obsessions of national politicians. “Are all of these decisions taken to protect minuscule interests bound by geography with a small-scale sense of justice and a short-term mindset really for the greater good of humanity?” he asks. “Whenever you think you've lost your way, look far off into the future.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1529338573/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1529338573&amp;linkId=1683b0de262080f3f15412672f6e18c9\"><strong>Aiming High</strong></a><strong>: Masayoshi Son, SoftBank Group and Disrupting Silicon Valley</strong> by Atsuo Inoue, <em>Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £20, 338 pages</em></p> <p><em>John Thornhill is the FT's innovation editor</em></p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/49e2f1ee-c923-47f7-ac6d-7f8e1747305b.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: John Thornhill 2021 'Aiming High — the rise of Masayoshi Son and SoftBank' FT.com 27 December.
