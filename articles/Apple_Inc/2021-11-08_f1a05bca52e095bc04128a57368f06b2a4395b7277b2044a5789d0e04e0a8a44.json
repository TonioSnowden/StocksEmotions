  "text": "<p><strong>Netflix's legal woes<br></strong>Should Netflix be treated as a distributor or a publisher? This is what lawyers continue to battle over as the streaming giant <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/netflix-suits-streaming-1235040681/\">faces more defamation complaints than any major news outlet</a>, according to the Hollywood Reporter.<br><br>Who is suing Netflix for defamation, you ask? A surprisingly wide range of people. There are the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/parent-involved-college-admissions-scandal-sues-netflix-over-documentary-n1263668\"><em>Operation Varsity Blues</em> parents</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/making-a-murderer-detective-andrew-colborn-sue-netflix-defamation-770538/\">cop</a> from <em>Making a Murderer</em>, and even a former Soviet chess grandmaster for a remark in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/sep/17/soviet-chess-champion-nona-gaprindashvili-sues-netflix-over-sexist-queens-gambit\"><em>Queen's Gambit</em>.</a></p> <p>The company's legal cases really started racking up when it started showing more true-crime documentaries, following the huge success of <em>Making a Murderer</em> in 2015, and it is being pursued by some legal heavyweights. </p> <p>Former Manhattan prosecutor Linda Fairstein has claimed that she was portrayed as racist in <em>When They See Us</em>, a drama about the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/netflix-must-face-ex-prosecutors-defamation-lawsuit-over-central-park-five-case-2021-08-09/\">Central Park Five case. </a>Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz also wants to take <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-05-27/alan-dershowitz-sues-netflix-jeffrey-epstein-show\">Netflix to court — for $80m</a>. </p> <p>Collectively, the lawsuits raise a bigger question: Is Netflix responsible for any potential defamatory documentary or film it distributes? Or only the shows produced in-house? What about the ‘Netflix Originals' that are exclusive to the platform but may involve other production companies? </p> <p>All the shows it has been sued for so far are exclusive to the platform, but have been either bought by Netflix or made in collaboration with other production companies. It is not always clear how involved Netflix is in the production process.</p> <p>Historically, cinemas do not end up in court over films exhibited on their screens, nor does YouTube. But, as Netflix looks increasingly like a Hollywood studio, it is becoming harder for it to say it is just a platform.</p> <p>This was the defence it offered in 2019 in its case about <em>Making a Murderer</em>. But the judge in the case, which is still ongoing, was not convinced, asking why Netflix had accepted awards for writing and editing the show. </p> <p>But Netflix also has not seemed keen to shield itself behind <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation\">Section 230</a> of the Communications Decency Act in the US, which provides immunity for internet platforms with respect to third-party content. Instead, it has left the Internet Association, one of Big Tech's main lobbying groups, and instead joined the Motion Picture Association of America, which has called on Big Tech to take more responsibility for the content on their sites. </p> <p>Perhaps streaming platforms will soon be held to the same standards as <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/producers-handbook/media-law/defamation/who-can-be-sued#:~:text=Until%20recently%2C%20any%20person%20who,or%20the%20newsagents%20or%20booksellers.\">traditional broadcasters</a>, who can be sued for defamation, including in programmes made by external production companies they air. </p> <p>So far, Netflix is the only major streaming company being sued for defamation and it has not lost a case yet, but Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Disney Plus and others will be watching closely.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1.
