  "text": "<p>   A recent Gallup poll included some grim news: Less than 50% of Americans belong to a religious community such as a church or a synagogue, the lowest since the organization began asking the question in 1937. As an Orthodox rabbi, I might feel gloomy about the future of my profession. But the prospects of American religion have never been brighter. </p><p>   This isn't solely a testament of faith. When the Pew Research Center asked Americans in 2012 to describe their feelings about spirituality, only 19% said they felt any spiritual stirrings. Five years later, that number rose to 27% -- even as the number of Americans who defined themselves as neither spiritual nor religious remained largely unchanged. While more Americans yearn for more spiritual connections, fewer feel comfortable finding them in traditional settings. </p><p>   This isn't news for those of us who have dedicated our lives to the rabbinate or priesthood. The reasons for the decline in synagogue and church attendance range from the changing nature of cities to competition with digital communication. Congregating with others in a physical space is a cornerstone of most faiths -- I happily do it three times daily -- but there's much more to religion than sitting quietly on a wooden bench and listening to a sermon. </p><p>   Seen this way, the new Gallup survey should be read not as an obituary but an opportunity. Religion is ripe for disruption, to borrow a term from Silicon Valley: Plenty of Americans still love the product -- just not its current platform. Nimble individuals and organizations have a chance to create communities of faith every bit as vibrant and meaningful as those that once huddled in brick-and-mortar buildings. How this is to be done is perhaps the most important question for American civic life in the coming decades. </p><p>   People attend religious services because they want a spot of religion. Yet worshipers hear too much about climate change, systemic racism and transgender rights and not enough about Abraham, Sarah and Isaac or Luke, Matthew and John. Treating religion like the Academy Awards or the National Basketball Association -- which also don't draw the same attention they used to -- has left Americans suspicious about traditional faith. This can be rectified by focusing on what business-school types call the core offering. </p><p>   While there's plenty that's ungodly about the vicissitudes of digital culture, it would be foolish to ignore increasingly popular formats. Father Mike Schmitz's \"Bible in a Year\" became one of the most downloaded shows in Apple's podcast app. Tens of thousands of Jews who hadn't been to a shul in years now tune in weekly to listen to \"Unorthodox,\" the world's most popular Jewish podcast. This is as an invitation to every rabbi, priest and minister in America to do as good spiritual shepherds have always done and come meet their flock where they graze. </p><p>   For some worshipers, these new platforms will be as far as they ever get on their religious journey. That alone would be a significant victory, considering such folks otherwise wouldn't be engaged. But for others, a new app or podcast might unlock the door to a much more serious, embodied commitment. </p><p>   Anyone curious about the future of religion should think about how habits changed over the past year -- and consider which ones will stick. With Covid-19 forcing people of faith to stay home, religious communities saw a huge uptick in virtual attendance. Many of those routinely tuning in online hadn't been regular attendees of in-person services. Why would the same folks who stayed away when church was a mere five-minute drive suddenly attend through Zoom? Convenience only counts for so much. </p><p>   Services offered during the pandemic were just that -- religious services. They were not, as so many felt compelled to offer before the pandemic struck, social gatherings with thin religious veneers. For decades houses of worship had flourished with the American suburb, serving as a focal point of communal life. In Jewish circles, this is known as \"a shul with a pool,\" suggesting that congregants should see the synagogue as the destination for everything, from Sunday school to a quick swim. This model is fading, and organizations that focus on the heart of the matter -- the prayers and rituals and rites -- are likely to reap the rewards. </p><p>   No doubt there will be more troubling poll data about the ostensible decline of faith in American life. But we should remember the words of that great Talmudic scholar Lenny Bruce, who quipped that every day people are straying away from the church and going back to God. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Rabbi Lamm is the founder of the Joshua Project and chief executive of Bnai Zion. </p><p></p>",
