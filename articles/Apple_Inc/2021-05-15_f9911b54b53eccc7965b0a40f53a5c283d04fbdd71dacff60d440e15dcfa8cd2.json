  "text": "<p>Over the past year, my Instagram feed has been flooded with colourful and kitsch jewellery. Singer Dua Lipa's selfies showed her iPhone attached to a necklace-like strap, crafted from plastic beads with charms, hearts and pearls, while models Bella Hadid and Kaia Gerber shared pictures of themselves wearing bulbous Teletubby-coloured resin rings from Barcelona-based La Manso, which sell for about £50. “It's like we're all living in an early edition of Cosmo Girl magazine,” commented an FT colleague.</p> <p>Some individuals have been crafting their own. Stylist Joel Traptow, 27, was more accustomed to the runways of Paris and Milan, working with brands such as Missoni and Nina Ricci, than spending hours threading lettered beads on strings. But during Canada's lockdown he took to necklace making as a jokey token of love for his boyfriend. It has become a nascent enterprise: within days of posting his first necklace on Instagram, made using inexpensive craft beads, Traptow was inundated with commissions. He says he enjoys the sense of naivety the beads bring.</p> <p>With its connotations of childhood summer vacations and joyful, Instagrammable colours, beaded jewellery is proving to be a feel-good hit. During the pandemic, it's been uber-popularised by millennials keen to indulge in nostalgia for the 1990s — for everything from friendship bracelets bought at high-street chain Claire's Accessories to the quirky chokers worn by the cast of Clueless.</p> <p>Inexpensive price points and ease of DIY craft have only fuelled the trend; creating jewellery proved a great way to occupy idle hands and anxious minds as Covid-19 cases soared. “It's mentally therapeutic,” says Roxanne First, a London-based designer known for her “BFF” and “Ciao” necklaces made of beads, plated gold and pearls. She started making bead jewellery for friends during the early pandemic months, which led to the release of her DIY “Bead for Your Bestie” kit.</p> <p>“Lockdown made me miss everyone,” she says. And, with stay-at-home orders in place, she says that crafting and sending a bracelet was “a way of showing your love”.</p> <p>First's kit was a popular choice for those with surplus cash to spend once the craft stores had run out. Costing £75, it includes a bracelet cord and an assortment of beads — cartoonish little mushrooms, smiley faces, orange wedges and so on.</p> <p>As a sentimental addition, each kit comes with an envelope. “The whole process of physically taking your envelope to the postbox takes you back to a place when things were simple and sweet,” says First. “It also provides people with a sense of completion, when there are so many things we can't do… finishing a bracelet or necklace is so satisfying.”</p> <p>Fashion brands have naturally capitalised on such demand, offering playful pieces at much higher price points. Balenciaga's Demna Gvasalia turned Haribo-style gummy bears into dangly earrings (£350). Meanwhile, Bottega Veneta has its own DIY-style necklace, beaded with flowers — costing £2,370, it's the kind of thing one can imagine gracing the neck of Clueless' shopping-obsessed Cher.</p> <p>For luxury etailers such as Matches Fashion, there has been a shift away from minimalist fine jewellery and an increase in interest in beads, colour and artistic designs with “positive messaging”, says Tanika Wisdom, the site's jewellery buyer. She says that searches for beaded jewellery have spiked by 45 per cent over the past three months — Lauren Rubinski's “Love” and “Happy” slogan bracelets and necklaces sold out instantly. At £60, they're among the cheapest pieces of jewellery on the site.</p> <p>Milan-based jeweller Bea Bongiasca, who creates wobbly scribble rings in pop-colour enamel, thinks such jewellery is “escapist… It's an easy way to adorn yourself with something fun and feel fabulous whilst at home in your casual clothes.”</p> <p>Marie-Cécile Cisamolo, a jewellery auction specialist at Christie's, is not surprised by the move away from expensive jewels. “When times are hard, people rely on energy from colourful gemstones and eccentric designs. After the second world war, with the economy struggling, floral and colourful jewellery became very popular. It is exactly what we are seeing now.” She thinks the endless Zoom meetings have only made this style of jewellery more relevant. “I myself wear bold necklaces for all my video calls now,” she says.</p> <p>Not sure how to style them? Traptow advises a “be yourself” approach: “Wear on its own or wear with multiple items, there are no rules with this. It is meant to be fun!” And with that, go forth and bead.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Flora Macdonald Johnston 2021 'Friendship bracelets bring the feelgood factor' FT.com 15 May.
