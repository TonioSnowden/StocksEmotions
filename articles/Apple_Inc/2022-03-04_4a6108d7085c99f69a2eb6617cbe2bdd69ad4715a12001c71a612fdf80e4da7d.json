  "text": "<p>Microsoft is to cut off sales of all of its products in Russia as Ukraine stepped up demands for the world's biggest technology groups to take more meaningful action to “stop enabling Russian propaganda and disinformation”.</p> <p>The software company, acting two days after Apple stopped sales in Russia, said it was doing so after being “horrified, angered and saddened” by events in Ukraine.</p> <p>Russia has tried to wean itself off a dependence on the Windows operating system in recent years, fearing that using US software in government systems could expose it to spying. Three years ago, it started adopting a version of the Linux operating system for use in military computers in place of the Microsoft software.</p> <p>However, Windows remains the dominant operating system in Russia and accounts for 55 per cent of computers in use in the country, according to Statcounter. Microsoft would not comment on the level of support it would continue to give existing customers in Russia, or whether it would supply upgrades and patches for its software, though its statement referred only to cutting off “new sales”.</p> <p>Microsoft's move came the day after rival software makers Oracle and Cisco said they had suspended their own businesses in Russia.</p> <p>California-based Electronic Arts also said on Friday that&#xa0;it would&#xa0;halt the sale of all of its games and content, including virtual currency bundles and in-game items, in Russia and Belarus. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1498945221337534469/photo/1\">previously called</a> on gaming companies to temporarily block all Russian and Belarusian accounts.</p> <p>Meta-owned Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Apple and TikTok all announced this week that they would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0a31741-ee65-42c0-b045-59c382a8a081\">remove state-backed media</a> outlets Russia Today and Sputnik from their platforms in the EU, following demands from officials in the bloc designed to throttle the spread of propaganda.</p> <p>Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have also been applying labels to Kremlin-backed media outside Russia and paused their ability to make money from advertising that runs alongside the content.</p> <p>But in a letter published on Friday, Fedorov and Oleksandr Tkachenko, information policy minister, urged large tech companies to do more. </p> <p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine was “made possible” by state-controlled media, whose “made-up stories about a genocide against Russians” was used to justify the war, they wrote. </p> <p>“Your platforms are fanning the flames of this war by spreading Kremlin-backed disinformation through your various technologies,” the ministers added. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://actions.sumofus.org/a/russia-disinfo-sign-on\">letter</a>, addressed to the heads of Meta, Apple, Google, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and Telegram, is part of a campaign from SumOfUs, a corporate accountability group that has previously played a role in encouraging Apple to adopt a human rights policy.</p> <p>It has garnered signatures from more than 100 advocacy groups, including the American Federation of Teachers, a national union, and Transparency International EU, a Brussels-based anti-corruption movement.</p> <p>The letter acknowledged that tech companies have taken unprecedented actions, with the removal of state media marking a new frontier for the social media platforms, which have tended to focus on removing covert operations rather than any domestic propaganda apparatus.</p> <p>But the Ukrainian ministers and advocacy groups said tech companies “must go much further and stop promoting these channels everywhere”.</p> <p>The letter asks for clear ways for users to report disinformation, demands the platforms stop the “algorithmic amplification of disinformation” and urges transparency so that third-party researchers can help the public better understand the influence, reach and engagement of state-backed accounts.</p> <p>Big tech groups have tried to strike a delicate balance, as their efforts to remove or fact check certain content have prompted Moscow to accuse them of censorship and restrict access to the platforms.</p> <p>Some experts warn that clamping down on state-backed propaganda could cause Moscow to ban European media from the country.</p> <p>“You don't fight propaganda by censorship,” said Benjamin Ismail, project director at AppleCensorship.com, a free speech advocacy site. “This is a godsend for authoritarian regimes.</p> <p>“It implies governments are legitimate to decide ‘what is truth' and ‘what is fake news'. And it encourages governments to criminalise speech under the guise of fighting disinformation.”</p> <p>Rewan al-Haddad, campaign director at SumOfUs, said tech platforms needed to step up their game against disinformation campaigns, rather than profiting from them. “These tech execs already have blood on their hands, but there's still time to act to protect the Ukrainian people.” </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Hannah Murphy in San Francisco and Anna Gross</em></p><p>Source: Patrick McGee and Richard Waters in San Francisco 2022 'Microsoft suspends Russia sales as Ukraine urges Big Tech action' FT.com 4 March.
