  "text": "<p>The US stock market suffered its <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/5cf5199c-5538-40b6-a059-d2c795108919\">worst start to the year</a> since the global financial crisis. </p> <p>The threat of rising interest rates, slowing corporate earnings growth and simmering geopolitical tensions led to the biggest monthly decline for the S&amp;P 500 since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and the weakest January since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009.</p> <p>Technology stocks bore the brunt of the selling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 9 per cent, its worst one-month decline since November 2008. It was a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25450ffe-e080-4f7a-b8d5-94d23d52af77\">record set of results</a> from Apple that halted the sell-off, preventing the S&amp;P 500 from recording its worst January sell-off on record.</p> <p>Looking further afield, the FTSE All-World index had its worst start to a year since 2016 when markets were upset by concerns about growth in China.</p> <p>Investors are braced for more volatility with tensions rising between the west and Russia in Ukraine, and the US Federal Reserve preparing to aggressively raise interest rates. </p> <p>“It's going to be that type of year,” said Wylie Tollette, Franklin Templeton Investments' head of client solutions. “We believe it's going to require a more nimble approach to asset allocation.”</p> <p><em>Are you preparing for further losses in the stock market or do you think we are past the worst of the falls?

Total donations to four of the most prestigious research groups have risen from at least $625,000 in 2017-18 to $1.2mn in 2019-20, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e4ca1d2-2d80-4662-86d0-067a10aad50b\">an FT analysis</a>.</p> <p><strong>The international cult of Vladimir Putin</strong> If the Russian leader triumphs in Ukraine, his thuggish style <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da08b08c-eac3-4586-abe3-c3691cb54f44\">will gain new followers</a>, argues Gideon Rachman in his latest column. “His fan club is global, spanning Asia, the Middle East, the Americas and Europe,” Gideon writes. </p> <p><strong>Who benefits from Japan's panic over ageing? </strong>There is no upbeat discussion to be had on Japan's declining population, but neither is there a way to avoid discussing it, and particularly how <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/980c49e8-e90c-47a6-b892-138a3b83d646\">Japanese corporations can function</a> with fewer humans. While outsourcing jobs overseas makes sense, businesses may not be ready.</p> <p><strong>Ireland's coalition under strain </strong>Apart from the easing of the pandemic, Prime Minister Micheál Martin's fractious coalition government has little reason for optimism. The taoiseach has <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/bd1d16a6-9bdf-4db0-8876-0b71839e57f1\">lost popularity</a> after scandals and is struggling to show progress on problems such as housing and healthcare.</p> <p><strong>You don't need to be a Stem genius to succeed in finance and tech </strong>Karina Robinson writes that she was <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/b92d90fe-8453-42ae-8065-c5bdf4304313\">the worst Spanish equities analyst</a> in the City of London, so much so that in 1987, she was fired from Morgan Grenfell after 15 months.
