  "text": "<p>\"WeCrashed,\" a series following the trajectory of former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann (played by Jared Leto) and his wife, Rebekah Neumann (Anne Hathaway), launched Friday on Apple TV+. It's the third drama about Icarus-like tech founders to debut in the space of a month. Hulu's \"The Dropout\" (starring Amanda Seyfried as Theranos's Elizabeth Holmes) and Showtime's \"Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber\" (with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Uber founder Travis Kalanick) are already unspooling with weekly episodes.</p><p>It's the latest iteration of Hollywood's appraisal of the tech industry. The 2010 movie \"The Social Network\" formed the blueprint for startup entrepreneurs as antiheroes in hoodies, and the HBO comedy \"Silicon Valley\" added scathing satire when it premiered in 2014.</p><p>Only one of the tech founders portrayed in the new rise-and-fall dramas has been convicted of a crime: Ms. Holmes, who is awaiting sentencing for deceiving Theranos investors. All the founders share traits as TV characters, including mammoth levels of ambition and drive that audiences are led to admire -- to an extent.</p><p>\"Until the greed or hubris reaches a point that we want to see a comeuppance. It's a combination of envy and schadenfreude,\" says Drew Crevello, who created \"WeCrashed\" with Lee Eisenberg.</p><p>(Representatives for Mr. and Ms. Neumann and Ms. Holmes didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.)</p><p>To retool the sometimes dry world of tech into juicy television, here are some of the narrative devices that \"The Dropout,\" \"WeCrashed\" and \"Super Pumped\" all used.</p><p>Follow the funding</p><p>The typical life cycle of tech startups makes certain narrative milestones inevitable, like funding deals with venture capitalists, high net-worth clients and bankers. The shows make these potentially dull business meetings dramatic. In a scene from the \"The Dropout\" set on Larry Ellison's yacht, the Oracle mogul (played by Hart Bochner) pushes Ms. Holmes to \"G.T.F.M.\" Translation: \"Get the f -- ing money,\" a chant she screams while wearing a life preserver.</p><p>Characters get ghosted</p><p>On their ascent to wealth, power and fame, all the founders leave scorched relationships with friends, family members and business partners in their wake. In \"Super Pumped,\" a girlfriend of Mr. Kalanick boosts his confidence for pitch meetings, but gets brushed aside after Uber gets funded. \"I guess I was just your seed round,\" she says.</p><p>Translate the Techspeak</p><p>To translate the computer code, algorithms and V.C. funding strategies into digestible dialogue, the shows count on punchy descriptions and analogies. In \"WeCrashed,\" a character pokes a hole in Mr. Neumann's cup to unleash a stream of water representing the millions WeWork is losing daily. \"Super Pumped\" uses narration by Quentin Tarantino to break down some business moves. \"Just because they hide it in the fine print of an app don't mean it ain't a scam,\" the narrator says.</p><p>All work, plus play</p><p>The on-screen startups expect cult-like loyalty from employees, and use parties as a perk. A Las Vegas bacchanal in \"Super Pumped\" results in a bill for $25 million in fees and damages. Tequila shots and employee hookups are recurring motifs in \"WeCrashed,\" which also features a summer camp retreat where WeWork staffersdisco withtheir boss.</p><p>Get inside the moguls' heads</p><p>Longform podcasts and books were the source material for TV writers who needed to create characters whom viewers would want to study over the course of a miniseries.</p><p>\"We remain completely fascinated by the person who thinks the world must change and that he can change it,\" says \"Super Pumped\" co-creator Brian Koppelman, also a creator of \"Billions.\"In one scene, Mr. Kalanick describes Uber as a higher form of life, compared with the taxi industry: \"This must have been what it was like when Homo sapiens were running around together with Neanderthals.\"</p><p>For \"WeCrashed,\" which was adapted from a Wondery podcast, researchers examined the personal lives of Adam and Rebekah Neumann. In the show, the real-estate entrepreneur who styled himself as a tech wizard has a strained relationship with his father; his wife struggles with a failed acting career. Their mystical agenda for WeWork leads Mr. Leto's character to say things like, \"Our mission is to elevate the world's consciousness. Period.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Chris Kornelis contributed to this article.</p>",
