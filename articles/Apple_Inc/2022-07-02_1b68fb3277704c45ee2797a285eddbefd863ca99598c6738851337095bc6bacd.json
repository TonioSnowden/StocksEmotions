The Vatican didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Musk's Twitter silence came after a period of particularly active tweeting about his bid to buy the messaging platform, including many posts about the proposed deal in which he talked about his criticism of the company and its policies.</p><p>Mr. Musk reached a deal to acquire Twitter Inc. on April 25, but later said the deal was on hold over his concerns that Twitter's estimate of spam and fake accounts might be flawed.</p><p>During his absence from Twitter, Mr. Musk's account surpassed 100 million followers.</p><p>Pope Francis is also among the platform's most prominent users, tweeting via nine accounts in English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Italian, French, Arabic and Latin. His English @pontifex account has 18.9 million followers.</p><p>The pope has met with other tech leaders, including Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook and Meta Platforms Inc.
