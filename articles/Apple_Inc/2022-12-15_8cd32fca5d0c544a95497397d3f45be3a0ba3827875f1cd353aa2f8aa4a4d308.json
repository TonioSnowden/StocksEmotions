  "title": "Tesla and four other laggards should be avoided next year, this technical analyst says; Critical information for the U.S. trading day",
  "text": "<p>\"In the short run, it's tough to have much conviction on direction on a 2-3 day basis given that prices are right in the middle of a giant 200 point one-month range. It's expected that any rally attempts up to 4100 should be sold, while declines under 3965 should bring about a retest and possible break of early December lows near 3918,\" writes Newton in a note published late Wednesday.</p><p>While investors ponder the S&amp;P 500's next move, they may also start to think about trades for next year. One popular strategy is to pick already battered stocks in hope for a revival.</p><p>But Newton has a list of five such laggards that he thinks should still be avoided for purely technical reasons — such as sub-par momentum, negative volume characteristics, and short-term price oscillators — and he stresses his observations do not consider the underlying fundamentals of the companies.</p><p>GameStop. GME The meme stock, already off more than 40% in 2022, is on the \"verge of breaking down from a one-year consolidation as part of a nearly two-year downtrend that's been in place since January 2021,\" says Newton.</p><p>He reckons the recent lows don't look likely to hold given the greater volume on down days of late and this could see a breach of the 2022 trough of $19.40. Technical support sits at $16.</p><p>Norwegian Cruise Lines. NCLH Shares had rallied more than 80% from June to November, but volume has expanded as last month's lows were broken.</p><p>\"It's expected that a final five-wave decline likely is underway that should test and break 2022 lows into Q2 of next year, which should result in NCLH pulling back to test and break $10.31 from June of this year…NCLH looks like a stock to avoid through Q2 of 2023\" says Newton.</p><p>Expedia. \"EXPE looks likely to break recent consolidation lows as a tradable bottom does not appear to be in place just yet. Despite its stabilization attempts since June, more than six months ago, prices were unable to lift and participate in the 10%+ rally seen by the SPX in recent months.\"</p><p>Again, volume has been heavier on down days, and Newton feels that after its recent bounce has again faded the November lows near $85 may be broken, with support not available until possibly $61.</p><p>Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings. \"OLLI stands out as being one to continue to avoid technically following the recent breakdown to new 2022 lows on above-average volume. While some expect this company to begin a recovery given its most recent return to sales and profit growth last quarter, technically this still looks to be an above-average candidate for underperformance,\" Newton contends.</p><p>Initial support lies at $37.67, but if broken then two year lows at $28.83 may loom.</p><p>Tesla. TSLA The EV group's stock is down 55% for the year as Elon Musk continues to sell and Newton remains wary of the technicals.</p><p>\"As weekly charts show below, the stock has broken down recently from a near two-year Head and Shoulders pattern, which happened back in mid-October just as the broader U.S. stock market was beginning to bottom out,\" he says.</p><p>In addition TSLA has just \"undercut the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement area of its run-up from 2019, and wave projections focus on support near $141, with additional levels not found until $111.\"</p><p>Newton says Tesla stock is still not oversold on a weekly or monthly basis and so the path of least resistance is lower for the time being.</p><p>Markets</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 were down 1.4% to 3975, while 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slipped 4 basis points to 3.465% and the dollar index DXY gained 0.4% to 104.14 as the market continued to absorb the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision and statements. U.S. crude oil CL.1 fell 0.5% to $76.88 a barrel and gold GC00 lost 1.8% to $1,786 an ounce.</p><p>For more market updates plus actionable trade ideas for stocks, options and crypto, subscribe to MarketDiem by Investor's Business Daily .</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Shares in Novavax NVAX are down nearly 15% in premarket action after the vaccine maker said it would raise $125 million via a share sale and convertible bond offering.</p><p>Data out of China showed the damage done by Beijing's strict COVID policy. Retail sales fell 5.9% in November from a year earlier, the worst performance since May. Industrial output rose 2.2% over the same period, but that was below expectations for a 3.6% increase.</p><p>U.S. retail sales fell 0.6% in November, much worse than the 0.1% decline forecast by economists, suggesting inflation and the Fed's rate hikes are taking their toll on consumers.</p><p>The November industrial production index and capacity utilization rate reports will be published at 9:15 a.m., followed by October business inventories at 10 a.m.</p><p>The euro EURUSD is off 0.3% and the British pound GBPUSD down 0.8% after the Bank of England and the European Central Bank both raised interest rates by 50 basis points.</p><p>Best of the web</p><p>SEC proposes rules that would squeeze stock-market middlemen.</p><p>Was there dodgy trading just before this week's CPI number landed?</p><p>The American left's chronic Nimby problem…..</p><p>….and from the same stable: Elon Musk's lib-trolling is backfiring.</p><p>The chart</p><p>Think forward to February 1st. If you fancy a trade before the Fed's first policy announcement of the year, you may wish to consider this chart from Bespoke Investment. In a nutshell, the last three Fed decision days have not been good for stocks.</p><p>\"That is the longest streak of consecutive declines on Fed days since the three meetings ending July of last year. Looking at the price action of the S&amp;P [500] over the past three meetings, today [Wednesday] basically stuck to the script. Whereas the index traded higher throughout most of the session leading up to the release of the policy decision, it plummeted when the statement hit the tape,\" notes Bespoke.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>Here were the most active stock-market tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m. Eastern. </p><p> Ticker  Security name  TSLA    Tesla  GME     GameStop  MULN    Mullen Automotive  AMC     AMC Entertainment  NIO     NIO  AAPL    Apple  BBBY    Bed Bath &amp; Beyond  AMZN    Amazon.com  DWAC    Digital World Acquisition Corp.
