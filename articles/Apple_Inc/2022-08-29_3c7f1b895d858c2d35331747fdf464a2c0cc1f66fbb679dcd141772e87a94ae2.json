  "text": "<p>In the late 1980s, a retired art and antiquities dealer named Forrest Fenn learned he had cancer and would likely be dead within three years. However, he declined to retire to his sickbed and wait for the end. Instead, he dreamt up a wheeze whereby he would hide a bronze chest containing gold and jewellery worth $1mn in the Rocky Mountains. Fenn survived the cancer but, in 2010, decided to go ahead with his plan regardless. He composed a poem, published in a memoir, that contained clues about the chest's whereabouts and invited the world to solve his puzzle. He thought it would be a bit of fun that would bring families together and get them outdoors, but the reality proved to be more complicated.</p> <p><em>Missed Fortune</em>, a new podcast from Apple TV Plus, opens with the story of Darrell Seyler, an ex-cop and recruitment specialist whose determination to find Fenn's treasure eventually cost him his job and his home. The host is Peter Frick-Wright, a journalist who began reporting on Seyler for Outside magazine in 2014 when he joined him on one of his missions to Yellowstone National Park. At the start of the trip, Seyler is certain he has found the location of the stash based on a grainy photograph that appeared to show a box wedged into an escarpment; by the end, he is in tears. He had already made multiple expeditions to Yellowstone and, on two separate occasions, had to be rescued by rangers. Seyler was fined and told by a judge to stay away from the park for five years, an instruction he blithely ignored.</p> <p>Many listeners will already know how the story ends, though the mystery of the treasure's whereabouts isn't the point here. In recounting Fenn and Seyler's stories, Frick-Wright gives us two fascinating character studies. The host interviewed Fenn several years before his death in 2020 and found a disagreeable man who made his fortune buying and selling Native American artefacts which some claimed weren't his to sell. Meanwhile, Seyler is emerges as a troubled soul who endured untold cruelty throughout his childhood.</p> <p>If there's one problem with <em>Missed Fortune</em>, it's the relentless solemnity of the storytelling. It is a common habit among narrative podcasts to introduce a superfluous subplot in which the hosts wrestle with their own demons, and this one is no different as Frick-Wright agonises over his apparently stalling career. But more frustrating is his reluctance to find the fun in this story of modern-day fortune hunters going to increasingly crazy lengths to land their prize. His is a determinedly glass-half-empty approach, as he turns an objectively entertaining story into a tale of a broken American dream. </p> <p>“Everybody wants this treasure hunt to be fun, to live in a world when that's all there is to it,” he says gloomily. “And it is fun, if your idea of fun is solving a riddle and on the way losing everything.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/missed-fortune/id1636560953\"><em>podcasts.apple.com</em></a></p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2022 'The hunt for a $1mn treasure chest in podcast Missed Fortune — review' FT.com 29 August.
