  "text": "<p>\n  \"I hope audiences are down to just get into the rhythms of it and go for the ride,\" cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo says of the film from entertainment company A24. \"It's a very emotional and a very quiet journey.\" </p><p>\n  The film tells the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, a myth about a mysterious figure that Gawain beheads on the condition that he face a similar fate a year later. Dev Patel plays Gawain. Alicia Vikander plays two characters: a devoted prostitute and, later, a rich woman who tries to seduce him. </p><p>\n  Mr. Palermo filmed some moments with the camera so close to Mr. Patel, it actually touched his face. The movie, shot in Ireland, features majestic landscape views -- the kind of immersive visual experience filmmakers call a reason to return to theaters. </p><p>\n  The creative team wanted to avoid the gray look of many movies set in the Middle Ages, though the grime is realistic enough that Ms. Vikander's street-urchin hair looks like it could hold a louse or two. The color green plays a big role, naturally, though Mr. Palermo said when shooting digitally, green can look too neon, so to deal with that he sometimes made the Green Knight and his armor look kind of . . . blue. </p><p>\n  \"When you have magic as part of your movie,\" he says, \"you can do anything.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'The Suicide Squad' </p><p>\n  Aug. 6, in theaters and on HBO Max; Warner Bros. </p><p>\n  Is the film a remake? A \"soft reboot\"? A sequel? James Gunn, director-writer of the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies who helmed \"The Suicide Squad,\" doesn't really care what people call it, just as long as they realize his R-rated take on this gang of supervillains is separate from David Ayer's PG-13 \"Suicide Squad\" in 2016. </p><p>\n  \"It's the most unique thing I've ever made because I had no rules,\" Mr. Gunn says. He brought in new characters, including \"King Shark,\" a meme-worthy ocean predator on land voiced by Sylvester Stallone, as well as a giant starfish and a charming rat named Sebastian. </p><p>\n  With the film, Mr. Gunn jumps from the Marvel universe of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" to characters from rival DC comics. The filmmaker doesn't take sides -- mostly. \"With 'Guardians' I know I'm speaking to children and 80-year-old people -- I know it's a family film,\" Mr. Gunn says. \"I will say, there's a lot of fun in making an R-rated superhero movie. It's a matter of being fully free.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'CODA' </p><p>\n  Aug. 13, in theaters and on Apple TV+; Apple Studios </p><p>\n  Emilia Jones plays Ruby, a high-school student who feels smothered by her parents, and dreams of leaving her small town to pursue music. These coming-of-age tropes hit differently in a movie about a teen CODA (child of deaf adults), in which American sign language appears in about 40% of the dialogue. </p><p>\n  \"You're asking your audience to step into a family and a culture and a language that might be new, so some of those familiar elements bring universality to the story,\" says writer-director Sian Heder. </p><p>\n  Also counting on the movie's ability to translate is Apple, which bought \"CODA\" at Sundance for $25 million, a record-breaking sum for that festival. </p><p>\n  Deaf cast members include Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur (as Ruby's parents) and Daniel Durant (as her older brother). The film's perspective shifts around communication, whether it's Ruby serving as her family's de facto translator in their fishing business, or the family's signed discussion during a concert of Ruby's that they can't hear. </p><p>\n  Ms. Heder, who is not deaf, relied on interpreters to adapt the written script into sign language, and to act as go-betweens with actors. Eventually she and other hearing people on the film who learned sign also used it among themselves, she says. \"We even signed on days when there wasn't any deaf cast working because it's a very useful set language.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Respect' </p><p>\n  Aug. 13, in theaters; MGM </p><p>\n  Aretha Franklin, who died in 2018 at age 76, handpicked Jennifer Hudson to play her on screen in a project that has been years in the making. The cast includes Audra McDonald, Forest Whitaker, Marlon Wayans and Mary J. Blige. The film isn't a birth to death biopic, but a portrait of the Queen of Soul from childhood to age 30 while she forged her path as an artist. </p><p>\n  \"When I first pitched it to the studio, the way I described it was, 'How does a woman with one of the greatest voices of all time not really know what her personal voice is?'\" says director Liesl Tommy, a South African theater director making her feature film debut. </p><p>\n  The film highlights Ms. Franklin's upbringing in the civil-rights movement. The singer's father, a Baptist minister, was one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s mentors. \"Her actions spoke for her commitment and love for Black people,\" Ms. Tommy says. \"I wanted to make sure that Black people in this film were based in love. For me that meant every single character was three-dimensional.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Candyman' </p><p>\n  Aug. 27, in theaters; Universal </p><p>\n  Saying \"Candyman\" five times while looking into a mirror became a scary prospect for many who watched the 1992 slasher film about an urban legend with a hook in place of his hand. The movie achieved cult status in part for its use of race as an element of horror: The Candyman was the specter of a Black man lynched for his romance with a white woman. </p><p>\n  That subgenre of horror would be defined for a different era by \"Get Out,\" Jordan Peele's 2017 thriller about whites co-opting the bodies of Blacks. In the wake of that Oscar-winning movie's success, one of the first movie projects Mr. Peele signed up for was producing a sequel to \"Candyman.\" </p><p>\n  Co-written by Mr. Peele, Win Rosenfeld and Nia DaCosta, and directed by Ms. DaCosta, the new film stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as an artist who loses himself in the Candyman myth. The film, which adds gentrification to its themes, takes place in luxury lofts on the former site of the Cabrini-Green public housing project in Chicago, a setting for the 1992 release. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  That's 12 movies, but here's one extra, for a baker's dozen: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'The Beatles: Get Back' </p><p>\n  Aug. 27, in theaters; Disney </p><p>\n  \"Lord of the Rings\" director Peter Jackson has gone from conjuring fantastical epics to excavating histories, this time taking on John, Paul, George and Ringo. He applied the digital wizardry at his New Zealand filmworks to 56 hours of footage and 150 hours of audio captured in 1969, including the Beatles' final rooftop concert. </p><p>\n  In addition to new audiovisual artifacts, the Disney release promises to revise the story of the group itself. A preview released by Mr. Jackson last year offered glimpses of the Beatles clowning around and huddled closely as they recorded the movie's exuberant title track. That smiley vibe is at odds with the glum portrait of a band breaking up in the 1970 film \"Let It Be,\" the project that generated much of Mr. Jackson's source material. </p><p></p>",
