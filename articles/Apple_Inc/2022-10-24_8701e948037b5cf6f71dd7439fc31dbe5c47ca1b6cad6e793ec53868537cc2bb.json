  "title": "U.S. Stocks Rise Ahead of Busy Earnings Week; Investors to parse results from major companies including Apple, Amazon.com and Boeing",
  "text": "<p>Last week, the Dow notched its best three-week stretch since November 2020, offering investors a reprieve from the selling pressure that has whipsawed portfolios this year. The rally was kicked off, in part, by a batch of corporate earnings—particularly from banks and airlines—that offered an encouraging outlook on the U.S. economy. Stocks then raced higher on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that Fed officials are likely to consider the possibility of shifting to smaller interest-rate increases in December.</p><p>\"Market participants are desperately looking for a Fed pause or pivot,\" said Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research.</p><p>Still, he cautioned that such hopes would likely be dashed by continuing high inflation and low unemployment, which would pressure the central bank to maintain its hawkish stance. \"We think a Fed pause is a long ways off,\" Mr. Senyek said.</p><p>Investors are looking ahead to a busy week of earnings results. Despite some early reports that have shown signs of optimism, fewer companies than usual are beating Wall Street's earnings expectations. Traders this week will parse reports from blue-chip companies including Coca-Cola and Boeing, in addition to megacap tech companies including Apple, Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>U.S. investors largely shrugged off geopolitical jitters from China, where Xi Jinping cemented his control over the ruling Communist Party by securing a third term and appointing a number of loyalists to the party's most powerful decision-making body.</p><p>The news sent Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index tumbling 6.4%, its biggest one-day decline since the global financial crisis, amid fears that Mr. Xi would continue to pursue zero-Covid policies and a hard line in foreign policy.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu both dropped around 13%. As of midday, the selloffwiped out some $55 billion of market capitalization from the five largest U.S.-listed Chinese companies.</p><p>Casino operator Las Vegas Sands, which owns properties in Macau, slid 11% in 4 p.m. trading, making it the worst performer in the S&amp;P 500. Tesla shares slumped 1.5% after the company lowered prices for vehicles sold in China, the world's biggest electric-vehicle market.</p><p>\"There is concern about the direction of U.S.-Chinese relations, and I think that will continue to ripple through the market,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But, she added, \"As far as Wall Street is concerned, it's still fixated on what the Fed is doing.\"</p><p>Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds inched higher on Monday, after reaching their highest levels since 2008 last week. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 4.231% from 4.212% Friday.</p><p>Many investors expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for a fourth consecutive time at its meeting next month. Most are now focused on what will happen in December. Federal-funds futures, used by traders to wager on the course of interest rates, on Monday afternoon showed a 43% chance that the central bank raises interest rates by a smaller 0.5 percentage point in December, up from 34% last week, CME Group data show.</p><p>Overseas, the FTSE 100 gained 0.6% after Rishi Sunak, the U.K.'s former Treasury chief, won the contest to succeed Liz Truss as prime minister, reassuring investors after a volatile period for British markets. U.K. government bond prices rallied, sending yields lower. The yield on the U.K.'s 10-year gilt fell to 3.750%, from 4.052% Friday.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.4%.</p><p>In Asia, China's CSI 300 dropped 2.9% and the Shanghai Composite fell 2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.3% amid a possible yen-buying intervention by the Japanese government.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Alexander Osipovich at alexo@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Rise Ahead of Busy Earnings Week</p>",
