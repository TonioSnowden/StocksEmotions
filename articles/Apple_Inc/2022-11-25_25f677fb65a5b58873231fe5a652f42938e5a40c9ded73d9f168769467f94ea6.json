  "text": "<p>   HIROSAKI, Japan -- Many areas of Japan are running so short of working-age people that local-government administrators are helping out on farms. </p><p>   On a recent weekend, Yoshiaki Kato joined a few elderly women in harvesting apples at an orchard in Hirosaki, a city in the country's north. Mr. Kato also occasionally carried baskets of the fruit and loaded them onto a cart before driving them away to be sorted by size and quality. </p><p>   \"I usually do desk work, so this is sort of refreshing for me,\" said Mr. Kato, a 33-year-old official at the tourism division in Hirosaki city hall. </p><p>   He is among a dozen city officials who have been dragooned into weekend work in the orchards for $6 to $7 an hour, less than half of what they usually earn, in a region of Japan known for its juicy apples. </p><p>   \"This is the next step for us to protect our main industry,\" said Shinichi Sakaki, a manager in the city-hall division that supports local apple producers. A survey of farmers in the Hirosaki area, many of them elderly, found that 80% are concerned about the lack of workers. </p><p>   Similar scenarios are playing out across Japan, where the population has been shrinking for over a decade due to low birthrates. Almost a third of the population is now 65 or older. </p><p>   The country has ushered more women and elderly into the workforce to help address its chronic labor shortage. With the supply of another group that has helped fill the gap -- foreign workers -- sputtering since the pandemic began, Japan is now turning to public servants. </p><p>   The country mostly closed its borders for over two years, largely cutting off the flow of foreign labor. Now that it has reopened, a sharp decline in the value of the yen -- as much as 25% against the dollar this year -- is making already modest wages even less attractive for the workers in developing countries whom Japan is trying to draw. Few farm or factory jobs pay more than $7 an hour. </p><p>   Companies that dispatch foreign workers to Japanese farms, factories or elderly-care facilities say that some want to return earlier than planned, or prefer to move to other countries, such as Australia, which recently started receiving Vietnamese workers on agricultural visas with much higher salaries than Japan. Vietnamese are the largest group of foreign workers in Japan. </p><p>   This past summer and fall, starting at 5 a.m., Shiro Sakashita pitched in for a couple of hours of drying kelp before heading to work at the town hall in the hamlet of Samani on the northern island of Hokkaido. </p><p>   \"It was quite tough for my body to get accustomed to the work,\" said the 47-year-old, one of some three dozen Samani officials drafted to dry kelp -- used to make broth -- or pick strawberries. After shuffling seaweed some days, he said, he got drowsy dealing with paperwork. </p><p>   For decades Japan has struggled with death from overwork, or karoshi, and after some high-profile cases a few years ago, the government encouraged workers and businesses to reduce overtime. </p><p>   More recently, though, it has encouraged second jobs -- even for public servants, who had been prohibited from moonlighting on principle. </p><p>   Many economists say the only long-term answer to Japan's demographic woes is immigration. Long reluctant to admit large numbers of foreign workers, Japan has gradually opened its doors wider over the past decade. There were 1.73 million foreign nationals working in the country last year, compared with fewer than 700,000 a decade ago. </p><p>   Lettuce farmers in Kawakami, a village north of Tokyo, have hired about 1,000 foreign workers from Vietnam and Indonesia each summer in recent years. After labor shortages during the pandemic, the farmers secured enough workers for this year. They are now worried about the impact of the weak yen for next year, says Masato Yui, a Kawakami official in charge of farming policy. </p><p>   Kawakami hasn't pushed local officials to work in the fields, Mr. Yui says, \"because it does not lead to a fundamental solution.\" He said he hopes workers from other countries, such as Cambodia, would come instead. </p><p>   In the apple-growing city of Hirosaki, some farmers have introduced robots for work such as weeding or sorting fruit, but they are not yet capable of picking apples. </p><p>   At the apple farm where Mr. Kato helps out, other locals pitch in during harvest in October and November, as well as in the spring, thinning out excess fruit. The average age of the mostly female helpers is over 70, said Keiichi Sato, the 52-year-old fifth-generation owner of the orchard, which ships out 80 tons of apples annually. </p><p>   After his orchard work was cut short by pouring rain one recent Sunday, Mr. Kato said he would stop by a hot spring to relax before getting ready for his office job the next day. </p><p>   \"I probably don't want to do this every day,\" he said. \"But it's nice to be outside.\" </p><p></p>",
