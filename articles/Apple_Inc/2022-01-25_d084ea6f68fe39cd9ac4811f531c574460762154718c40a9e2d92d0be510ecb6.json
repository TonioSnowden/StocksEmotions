  "title": "Justin Timberlake Made an Insane Profit on His NYC Penthouse, and This Picture Explains Why",
  "text": "<p>The insane profit after just four years of homeownership is good news for the couple, whose previous “starter penthouse,” located in New York's SoHo, languished on the market before selling for a loss at $6.35 million in 2017.&#xa0;</p><p>The couple must have learned from their real estate mistakes, as they clearly picked a winning property this time around. So what's so special about this place? Allow us to explain.&#xa0;</p><p>Why Justin Timberlake's penthouse turned such a profit</p><p>Realtor.comLocated at 443 Greenwich St., the brick building—a converted, 19th-century warehouse once used for bookbinding—occupies a block in the chic Tribeca neighborhood. Timberlake and Biel's apartment boasts a combination living, dining, and kitchen space; a floating staircase; wide-plank wood floors; and a kitchen with stained oak cabinets.&#xa0;</p><p>But are an open floor plan and wood floors really worth millions? It is when you factor in the neighborhood, where real estate prices have shot up significantly over the past year.&#xa0;</p><p>“This historical prewar building with stunning architectural details is located in prime Tribeca,” says&#xa0;Amy Herman, licensed real estate salesperson at Serhant, who works with a number of high-profile clients in New York City. “In isolating Tribeca properties that traded for above $20 million, the average price per square foot increased 32%, to $5,151 per square foot, over the last two years.”</p><p>But what makes this particular building so appealing is that it's “paparazzi-proof.” The photo below speaks volumes: Timberlake and Biel need not show their faces coming and going from the building. Instead, they can drive in and out undetected via an underground parking lot (with valet service, of course).&#xa0;</p><p>Realtor.comMeanwhile, the building features a secondary lobby for residents who prefer to take their own private elevators straight to their floors rather than mixing with the hoi polloi.</p><p>“The developer for this building added many features to ensure the privacy of the residents,” says Wendy Flynn of the Keller Williams Wendy Flynn Team in College Station, TX. “This allows celebrities to live a more normal life, especially if they have a family.” (Timberlake and Biel are parents to two young sons.)</p><p>In the bustling Big Apple, privacy is hard to find, making this residence a true rarity.&#xa0;</p><p>“Paparazzi-proof buildings are quite rare,” says Herman. “So 443 Greenwich is extremely private and unusual in that there is a covered entrance via the building's private garage to help A-list celebrities get in and out with ease.”</p><p>Not surprisingly, this building boasts a number of famous residents present and past.&#xa0;Harry Styles&#xa0;and&#xa0;Rebel Wilson&#xa0;currently live there, as does&#xa0;Jake Gyllenhaal. And if you think Timberlake and Biel's apartment was pricey, Formula One star&#xa0;Lewis Hamilton&#xa0;sold his pad there&#xa0;for a mind-boggling $50 million&#xa0;in December 2021.</p><p>Realtor.comAnother reason the “Bye Bye Bye” singer may have made such a tidy profit? Residents of 443 Greenwich St. have access to amazing amenities. They include 24/7 concierge service—in case you have a hankering to book Broadway theater tickets at 3 a.m. There's also a valet service and a 71-foot indoor swimming pool.</p><p>Realtor.comOther amenities include a children's playroom, 5,000-square-foot landscaped roof terrace, central courtyard, fitness center, and private yoga and Pilates studio. Still need more? How about a sauna&#xa0;and&#xa0;a Turkish bath.&#xa0;</p><p>Realtor.com“The privacy plus luxury amenities draws ultrahigh net worth clients—CEOs and celebs alike—as they have their own private club and community within the residential building,” says Herman.</p><p>It's not surprising why celebrities are attracted to this property, adds&#xa0;Jason Gelios, an award-winning real estate professional and author.</p><p>“It truly offers an oasis for those seeking to get away from it all without having to purchase an island,” says Gelios.</p><p>This story was originally published on Realtor.com.</p>",
