  "title": "Dow soars 600 points as Powell says no plans to trigger a recession after biggest Fed interest rate hike since 1994; ECB holds emergency meeting",
  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 621 points, or 2%, at 30,991, near the session high.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 94 points, or 2.6%, at 3,832.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 407 points, or 3.8%, to trade at 11,239.</p><p>Stocks ended mostly lower on Tuesday, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 posting their lowest closes since early 2021 as the indexes extended their losing streak to five days. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2%.</p><p>What's driving the market</p><p>Stocks were higher in choppy trade, after the Federal Reserve pulled the trigger on a 75 basis point rate hike on Wednesday, its largest such increase in nearly 30 years, as the central bank works to quickly quell inflation that's proven hard to tame from a four decade high.</p><p>Fed officials also saidthey now expect the central bank's policy rate to climb to about 3.4% by the end of this year, while ending 2023 near 3.8%, in a statement. They also said the economy is expected to slow to a 1.7% growth rate this year.</p><p>\"The tightening in financial conditions that we've seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply,\" said Chairman Jerome Powell, while also saying similarly large rate hikes likely wouldn't be common going forward, in an afternoon press conference.</p><p>Read: Fed sees inflation topping 5% in 2022 and then falling rapidly due to higher rates</p><p>Many Wall Street economists has been expecting a 75 basis points hike, instead of the smaller 50 basis point move as previously telegraphed, after Friday's hot inflation reading, including economist at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.</p><p>Barclays economists, following the Fed decision, said they now expect the Fed to revert to a 50 basis point hike in July, due to signs of slowing consumer spending and a cooling of the U.S. housing market.</p><p>\"You are seeing a positive reaction in markets after Powell said the Fed would be aggressive in fighting inflation,\" said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management, in an interview.</p><p>Instead of a \"death by a thousand cuts,\" Snyder said there now is \"more clarity on what the policy is going to be.\"</p><p>Powell said the Fed isn't trying to push the economy into a recession, but also that some aspects of the surprisingly strong May consumer-price inflation data released last week remain out of the Fed's control. The reading struck a blow to those hoping that price rises had peaked. It also sparked a fresh rout for stock markets and other assets, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index into bear-market territory.</p><p>Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments, said that since Friday's hot inflation data, traders have been expecting the Fed to deliver the second-fastest start to a rate-hiking cycle since 1955, in a phone interview.</p><p>If that pans out, Powell's first year of tightening would be eclipsed only by the 1980s rate-hiking cycle under former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, when looking at roughly the past 70 years. Volcker often has been credited with breaking the back of inflation, by unleashing a recession.</p><p>\"There's a very strong possibility that the Fed goes too far and inadvertently causes a recession,\" Schulze said.</p><p>Economic data on Wednesday showed U.S. retail sales fell by 0.3% in May, below forecast, while sales minus autos rose 0.5%. Excluding autos and gas, sales rose 0.1%.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index has lost 10.2% over the past five trading days, the worst such decline since March 2020, when the pandemic was unfolding in the U.S.</p><p>The Fed decision's followed a surprise announcement by the European Central Bank, which held an emergency meeting on Wednesday to \"discuss current market conditions.\"</p><p>The ECB said it would use reinvestments from its expired pandemic emergency purchase program, or PEPP, combat the widening of spreads between yields of highly indebted countries and core countries like Germany, while working to fashion a new instrument designed to fight \"fragmentation\" of its monetary policy efforts. Economists had widely predicted that markets would test the ECB after policy makers last week failed to concretely address fragmentation worries.</p><p>See also:   Why the ECB called an emergency meeting as it wrestles with 'fragmentation' risk</p><p>The rare ad hoc ECB gathering, which comes just a week after the central bank's meeting, helped drive Italian bond yields lower and rallied the euro EURUSD and European stocks XX:SXXP.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Apple Inc.
