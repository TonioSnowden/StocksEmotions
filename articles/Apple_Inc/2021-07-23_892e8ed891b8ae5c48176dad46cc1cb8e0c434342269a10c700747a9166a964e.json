  "title": "Ted Lasso — sweaty, sweary football comedy returns to Apple TV Plus",
  "text": "<p>To give them their due, the writers of <em>Ted Lasso </em>cannot have imagined the pain they would be inflicting with the dreaded opening words of series two: “And it's a penalty . . . ” Too soon! The resulting debacle, involving an involuntary but fatal save by the club's own mascot, Earl the greyhound, is even more tragic than anything dreamt up in an England final. As striker Dani Rojas (Cristo Fernández) trudges glumly off the pitch, it's clear that ever-hopeful American manager Ted Lasso will have to find some new motivational methods, and fast.</p> <p>Twenty Emmy nominations is quite a haul for a sweaty, sweary but essentially sweet-natured comedy about football. But then many people are in total agreement with Dani that “Football . . . is . . . life.” Lasso, the genial transplant from the Midwest to leafy south-west London, is undaunted by the team's seven consecutive ties: “We gon' get a W soon!” He's a glass half-full kinda guy, pointing out: “We are still undefeated.” But Dani's penalty funk is a clear case of — whisper it — the yips, and before it spreads to the whole team, Higgins (Jeremy Swift) suggests bringing in a sports psychologist. The newcomer, po-faced Dr Sharon, is possibly the only person in the world who's immune to Ted's goofy charm. </p> <p>Further fish-out-of-water fun comes in the form of abrasive former Chelsea hard man Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein), who's now coaching an enthralled bunch of tinies: his next cup final is the West London Under-Nine Girls. Girlfriend Keeley (Juno Temple) persuades him to take up a post as a TV pundit, where his foul mouth endears him to the viewers, if not the watchdogs. The spoof <em>Football Focus</em> programme is cleverly done, as are segments of a highly believable reality TV show, <em>Lust Conquers All</em>, featuring obnoxious but gifted former player Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster) as the love rat. Voted off and now the most hated man in football, if not all England, Jamie wants to rejoin the team. Even Ted's inexhaustible optimism wilts at the prospect. </p> <p>The sterling core team returns intact, including Nick Mohammed as snarky sideline whistle-wrangler Nathan, Brendan Hunt as deadpan Coach Beard and Hannah Waddingham as dazzling boss Rebecca. A serious issue looms with a row over a disreputable sponsor. Some of the characterisation is so broad-brush you could paint a wall with it; Dr Sharon is an infuriatingly wise owl and Rebecca's visiting goddaughter is every mouthy teenage know-it-all you've ever wanted to superglue to a naughty step. It all rests on Golden Globe-winning Sudeikis's affable, biscuit-proffering Ted, a new-minted character who already carries glimmers of comedy immortality. His ebullience might be just what we need right now.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from July 23</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Suzi Feay 2021 'Ted Lasso — sweaty, sweary football comedy returns to Apple TV Plus' FT.com 23 July.
