  "title": "Stocks Waver After Jobs Report, Tech Selloff; January jobs report beat expectations; indexes on track for weekly gains",
  "text": "<p>The retreat in U.S. stocks coincided with a sharp move-up in U.S. government bond yields. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note climbed to 1.927%, versus 1.825% Thursday, on track for the largest one-day yield gain in about a month. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>The moves followed the Labor Department's release of the January jobs report, which showed that U.S. payrolls grew by 467,000 for the month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a gain of 150,000.</p><p>The gain in hiring will likely do little to change the Fed's intention to lift interest rates from near zero next month. But some investors speculated Friday that the jobs report could support more hawkish Fed action. Officials have in recent days played down speculation that they might raise interest rates by a half percentage point in March instead of a quarter point, but they have also said that their rate increases will be guided by data.</p><p>All three major U.S. stock indexes are still headed for weekly gains, with each on track to notch a gain of 0.5% or more. That is even after technology and social-media companies dragged indexes down Thursday. Facebook owner Meta Platforms in particular plunged after a disappointing earnings report. It fell 2.9% Friday.</p><p>Amazon.com shares rallied 12% after the e-commerce giant said profit nearly doubled in the critical holiday period, as the company controlled labor and supply costs better than expected and saw gains in its cloud-computing and advertising businesses.</p><p>Sharp moves in the share prices of large technology and social-media companies have an outsize impact on broader indexes. Amazon had a 3.3% weighting on the S&amp;P 500 as of Wednesday, according to data from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Meta had a 2% weighting.</p><p>\"Those companies which have continued to deliver strong results have held up relatively well,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"Those companies which were priced as heavily valued growth stocks, but then under-delivered, are getting hit extraordinarily hard.\"</p><p>Snap shares surged 46% after the social-media company posted its first quarterly profit and signaled it is adjusting to disruptions in the digital-advertising market caused by Apple privacy policy changes that are affecting Meta. Pinterest rose 4% after it reported its first full-year profit and more than $2 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>However, Clorox shares tumbled 15% after the maker of disinfectant wipes and other cleaning products reported earnings that missed analysts' expectations and said margins would take a steep hit from continued cost pressures. Ford Motor shares declined 11% after the auto maker posted earnings that fell short of Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>Oil prices climbed, with global benchmark Brent crude up 2.5% at $93.35 a barrel, due to supply tightness and a winter storm in the U.S. that may disrupt production.</p><p>International markets have been volatile in recent weeks, and on Friday, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.4%. Markets have been rattled by the increasingly hawkish tone from global central banks. On Thursday, the Bank of England raised borrowing costs again, while the European Central Bank kept its key interest rates unchanged, but signaled concern about inflation and opened the door to a possible rate rise this year.</p><p>Annual inflation in the eurozone rose to a record 5.1% in January, more than double the ECB's target. Some investors are betting on future rate rises to curb inflation, and are selling government bonds, pushing the yield on Italy's 10-year debt up to 1.714% Friday, from 1.650% Thursday. In a sign of rising risk aversion, the spread between benchmark Italian and German government bond yields rose to its highest level since July 2020.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has also set the stage for a series of rate increases in 2022, leading investors to shift toward investments that are deemed safer, such as stocks of companies that pay regular dividends.</p><p>The market volatility could continue until the Fed implements its first interest-rate increase and investors get used to the idea of rising rates, said Peter Andersen, founder of Massachusetts-based investment firm Andersen Capital Management.</p><p>\"The fact that everything is sold off wholesale is really, in my opinion, a buying opportunity,\" Mr. Andersen said. \"Every investor is so spooked now, and nobody really has a compass to figure out where exactly we are in this cycle.\"</p><p>In Asia, stocks in Hong Kong resumed trading Friday following a three-day holiday closure. The Hang Seng Index added 3.2%, led by gains in banking and technology stocks. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.7%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com, Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com and Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com.</p><p>Stocks Waver After Jobs Report, Tech Selloff</p>",
