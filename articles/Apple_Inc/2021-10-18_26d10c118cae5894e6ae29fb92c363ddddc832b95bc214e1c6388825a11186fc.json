  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>When the Paris treaty on climate change was adopted in 2015, the notion that the five-year check in — at next month's delayed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/141ad2e5-35e9-4cf9-8cbc-34c304aa08d5\">COP26 summit</a> in Glasgow — would be taking place amid the wreckage of a global pandemic was a rather fanciful one.</p> <p>The combination of large economies causing a spike in energy demand as they spring back to life, together with supply chain problems, labour shortages and rising inflation has all combined to form a “perfect storm” (according to all news outlets), threatening the economic recovery from coronavirus.</p> <p>The latest twist comes today from Russia, where energy giant Gazprom — which supplies almost a third of continental Europe's gas — damped down hopes of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/760b2a01-d1ec-4177-bae5-27f29c7ad646\">increased supplies</a> next month, sending prices up by 18 per cent. </p> <p>Aside from attempts at mitigating rocketing costs for consumers, such as “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2883d0d6-d821-4443-b5fd-ae904cef6e52#post-eb84c507-87a9-48fe-b11d-5654d8c7869b\">fuel cheques</a>” in France or a potential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52d6b067-47d4-4fd3-bbaa-5eef4562189a\">cut in value added tax</a> on household bills in the UK, the crisis has also highlighted sharp differences in national energy policies.</p> <p>In the UK, where an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44b6ca25-a827-4336-bf36-7da442cbb38d\">investment summit</a> focusing on green energy is being held tomorrow, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6426194-21e6-49c4-9520-97c337b350fd\">nuclear power</a> is at the heart of its strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8321364f-2693-49f0-a8ec-9ef71be24fee\">EU policy</a> on the other hand is complicated by the fact that member states are moving in two different directions. France, the biggest supporter of nuclear, is promising to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d06500e2-7fd2-4753-a54b-bc16f1faadd8\">invest €1bn</a> in the sector by the end of this decade, while Germany has decided to phase it out completely by next year. Belgium is also determined to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79912a8b-b50c-4d6a-af97-5a89d2038f25\">ditch nuclear</a> and increase its reliance on gas. </p> <p>In the US, Democrats from coal-heavy states are holding up President Joe Biden's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc1058e0-916a-45fb-8517-85138cacddf5\">green energy plans</a>. And in China, the government is trying to address <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5174e592-1f0b-4334-91ab-aa89ceff3821\">power outages in factories</a> — a contributory factor to the country's slowdown in growth shown in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aafca7d3-10a9-41c5-9832-f6e199a5c630\">today's GDP data</a> — by reverting to dirtier fuels, ordering a rapid expansion in coal mines despite its pledges last year to reduce carbon emissions. </p> <p>The scale of the challenges ahead in Glasgow was underlined last week by the International Energy Agency. Global emissions dropped sharply in 2020 because of the pandemic, the IEA said, but the speed of the global recovery means they are now on course for their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/644e392b-21de-47f3-accd-0e50be703520\">second-largest ever annual increase</a>.</p> <p><em>You can find all our reporting on the run-up to COP26 at our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/climate-capital\"><em>Climate Capital</em></a><em> hub</em></p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/141ad2e5-35e9-4cf9-8cbc-34c304aa08d5.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>US industrial production unexpectedly fell last month as supply chain problems drove the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2883d0d6-d821-4443-b5fd-ae904cef6e52#post-6ff72455-5769-4c48-b81b-7b656801b60e\">biggest drop in manufacturing</a> in seven months</p></li>  <li><p>German health minister Jens Spahn said coronavirus restrictions <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/politik-inland/nach-19-monaten-spahn-corona-notstand-in-deutschland-endet-77993714.bild.html\">could end on November 25</a> (Bildzeitung)</p></li>  <li><p>Italy's president hit out at protests against new coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2021/10/18/fight-anti-science-drift-says-mattarella_9e27e64a-c712-4f9d-8d85-35563e1d0f24.html\">workplace health pass requirements</a>, arguing that “violent acts” would jeopardise the country's economic recovery (Ansa)</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2883d0d6-d821-4443-b5fd-ae904cef6e52\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Eagerly awaited GDP figures from <strong>China</strong> showed growth of 4.9 per cent in the third quarter, with quarter-on-quarter growth of just 0.2 per cent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aafca7d3-10a9-41c5-9832-f6e199a5c630\">confirming the slowdown</a> in the country's recovery. The new data add to pressures on President Xi Jinping as he enters the final year of his second term and continues his “common prosperity” strategy with its focus on wealth redistribution.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>Traders are now betting on an increase in <strong>interest rates</strong> from the Bank of England <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eab549c0-828e-44ab-8a22-b114bf2fe20f\">as early as November</a> after BoE governor <strong>Andrew Bailey</strong> warned the bank “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/160e6e1a-2584-4013-8102-3ae5cfadb1d8\">would have to act</a>” to curb inflation. Chief economics commentator <strong>Martin Wolf</strong> is scathing about government policy, arguing that it was impossible to deliver a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy based on the “Brexit dividend” of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf4f99ac-69f3-455f-ab89-1004188f03d7\">restricting immigration</a> of low-skilled people. New UK inflation figures will be published on Wednesday.</p> <p><strong>UK house prices</strong> continue to surge, with new data from the Rightmove property portal showing increases in all sections and regions for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2883d0d6-d821-4443-b5fd-ae904cef6e52#post-6720dc2c-3338-438d-b270-9efad0f4a3cf\">the first time in 15 years</a>. Demand is still outstripping supply and buyers are scrambling to secure mortgages ahead of any rises in interest rates.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>Congestion at the <strong>world's ports</strong> tells us a lot about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8eb4e20f-b436-4245-af92-74a8f3c9e3bc\">pre-pandemic problems</a> of the global economy, writes columnist Rana Foroohar, from the mismatch between skills and jobs to an over-reliance on China for manufactured goods. One solution might be to institute a “rule of four” — that no more than 25 per cent of any crucial supply should be sourced from one place, or come into one port.</p> <p>Veteran investor Mohamed El-Erian warns of the dangers of rising inflation and supply chain problems for <strong>developing countries</strong>. Higher import costs are fuelling food insecurity and soaring energy costs are crippling industrial production, while ultra-loose monetary policies in the US and Europe have diverted capital to richer nations in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/587a6a39-54ed-4d69-a677-5663cc9880f2\">search of higher returns</a>.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>Shares in <strong>Valneva</strong>, the French vaccine maker, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfc924b5-8f7d-4a7d-8cb0-3a1c6d478c16\">surged 43 per cent</a> today after trial results showed its Covid-19 jab produced a stronger immune response with far fewer side effects than the comparable jab from Oxford/AstraZeneca. Its shares had fallen by a similar amount last month after the UK government ended its agreement to buy at least 100m doses.</p> <p><strong>Philips</strong> become the latest company to cut its annual forecast because of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0933b1c3-d185-44c7-9d07-4c292b4b7440\">supply chain problems</a>. Revenues at the Dutch manufacturer have also been hit by the recall of faulty sleep apnoea devices. </p> <p><strong>DIY share trading</strong> boomed during lockdown, with more than 7m people in the UK and 30m in the US opening investing accounts in the first 12 months of the pandemic. Users flocked to platforms such as Robinhood and ETrade in the US, or CMC Markets in London. But is this new army of traders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9d546a3-cd7c-419b-844d-7039a1eb5294\">here to stay</a>? </p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>Some people say: after a crisis, you should be able to go back to how things were. Others say: the <strong>essence of a crisis</strong> is that you fundamentally change. Psychotherapist Esther Perel offers some tips on how to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c4224f3-26b3-43d2-bb5e-feb314875aa3\">navigate the “next normal”</a> at work.</p> <p>One route to that change is an <strong>executive MBA</strong>, where — perhaps not surprisingly — there is a new focus among business schools and students on resilience and managing disruption. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/06f68927-558f-41ca-9c2f-cf30cd47416d\">Browse our latest guide</a>, including rankings of the world's top courses.</p> <p>For those of us who started work before the iPhone arrived in 2007, writes columnist Pilita Clark, <strong>downtime</strong> was far easier to find.
