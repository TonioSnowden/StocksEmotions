  "text": "<p>   Kudos to Allan Ripp for gratuitously, unexpectedly and discreetly handing $20 bills to myriad \"people going about their jobs with no expectations of being personally thanked\" (\"How I Reached the Tipping Point,\" op-ed, Dec. 9). Mr. Ripp's practice recalls that of multimillionaire John D. Rockefeller, the richest man in the world for some time, known for bestowing a dime on many people he came across. </p><p>   Mr. Ripp, however, is far, far ahead of Rockefeller. According to the Minneapolis Fed's inflation calculator, one of J.D.'s 1920s-vintage dimes had the buying power of around $1.50 in today's currency. </p><p>    Bill Apple </p><p>   New York </p><p></p>",
