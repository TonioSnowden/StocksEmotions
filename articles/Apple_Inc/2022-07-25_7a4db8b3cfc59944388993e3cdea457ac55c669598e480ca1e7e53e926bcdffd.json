  "text": "<p>Good morning. Probably the biggest story in markets last week, other than a bunch of earnings news to sift through (more on that in this space over the coming days) was a big drop in yields: on Thursday and Friday, ten year yields dropped 29 basis points to 2.78 per cent. The two year fell almost as much. Broadly, the recession story beat the inflation story. But this was just a skirmish in a longer war. Yields have been bouncing around in a sideways range since April. It ain't over till it's over. Email us: ethan.wu@ft.com and robert.armstrong@ft.com.</p> <h1>Fixing retail trading</h1> <p>Gary Gensler, the SEC chair, has a plan for equity markets. Outlined in a June speech, it's stuffed with reasonable reforms many market participants already say they agree with — and one sweeping change that could sink it all. </p> <p>Gensler's big idea is “order-by-order competition” for retail stock orders, perhaps using an options-style auction system. At the moment, the overwhelming majority of retail trades flow through market makers like Citadel Securities and Virtu. Order-by-order competition would let any trading firm fill a retail order. </p> <p>Wall Street is steaming mad and promising a huge fight. A Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-genslers-assault-on-u-s-capital-markets-partisan-activist-sec-shareholders-investors-funds-executive-office-11658077526?mod=opinion_lead_pos5\">op-ed</a> last week, written by two professors backed by a <a href=\"https://www.capmktsreg.org/members/\">who's who</a> of financial services firms, decried the “entirely new and untested system of auctions,” saying it could spell the end for zero-commission trading.</p> <p>Remember the basics. Two popular ways stock brokers make money are charging commissions and collecting payment for order flow (PFOF). Charging commissions is easy. You pay the broker a fee for each trade, and the broker sends that trade to an exchange or another venue. PFOF is fiddly and annoying. Consider a humble retail trader called Rob buying a share of Apple:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Rob's broker sends his buy order to a market maker.</p></li>  <li><p>Rob's order is valuable to market makers because Rob doesn't have any sophisticated info on where markets are heading. He just likes the stock. So market makers can harvest the bid-ask spread without worrying that trading against Rob will lose them money.</p></li>  <li><p>Rob's order is so nice and non-threatening that the market maker will pay the broker for the privilege of executing him. That's PFOF.</p></li>  <li><p>Ultimately, the spread between the cheapest Apple share the market maker could find and Apple's publicly quoted share price gets divvied up between the market maker (blue bars below), Rob (orange) and his broker (white). This chart made last year by Bloomberg's Larry Tabb illustrates it nicely:</p></li> </ul> <p>It's not obvious this is a raw deal for Rob. In principle, those orange bars could be bigger, but we're talking about fractions of a penny for most retail investors. As we've <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90957187-c43e-44a7-9d70-d0218f64318f\">written</a>, “No one is getting screwed. Rather, it is as if everyone is paying a very light, but probably pointless, tax.”</p> <p>Gensler is less sanguine. He argues that present market structure is shot through with conflicts of interest. Two stand out from his June speech:</p> <ol>  <li><p>PFOF incentivises brokers to add game-like features, tempting retail to trade more. That is profitable for the broker but maybe those retail investors should just buy an S&amp;P 500 ETF (or whatever) instead. (Unhedged wonders why commissions aren't said to create the same incentive, at least to a degree.)</p></li>  <li><p>PFOF and exchange fees influence where brokers choose to send customers' orders. Perhaps brokers are choosing the highest-PFOF or lowest-fee venue instead of the one that gets customers the best prices. </p></li> </ol> <p>Order-by-order competition could mitigate conflict 2, removing broker discretion on where to send retail flow. Institutional traders would be eager to offer liquidity against those nice, non-threatening retail orders, notes Hitesh Mittal of BestEx Research. Retail could see the prices they pay competed down, at least for in-demand stocks.</p> <p>What about where competition is shallower? Under the current system, Virtu CEO Doug Cifu told Unhedged, market makers' value proposition to brokers includes executing on the “long tail of names”. But under order-by-order competition, lightly traded stocks could face worse pricing. Cifu gave his own firm as an example:</p> <blockquote>  <p>My friends at Citadel, believe me, they don't want to internalise Virtu stock. Not because they don't like me, but because they probably would lose money on it everyday. Maybe not that much, but when you have 3,000 names like that, it adds up . ..</p>  <p>[But market makers only internalising popular stocks isn't] how markets work. You can't cherry pick to that extent.</p> </blockquote> <p>(As far as we can tell, market structure experts' views on this are split. Some, like Tabb, share Cifu's <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-09/how-trading-may-change-under-new-sec-rules-q-a-with-larry-tabb\">concern</a>. Others, like Mittal, say that competition is likely to create better pricing on average, even if there might be some exceptions.)</p> <p>Killing off zero-commission trading for retail is the other big knock against order-by-order competition. Even if the SEC doesn't explicitly ban PFOF, restructuring retail trading away from market makers would surely diminish the practice. </p> <p>Sceptics downplay this possibility, pointing to countries that have banned PFOF, such as Canada, but still have no-commission brokers. Running a retail trading operation is relatively cheap, says Ty Gellasch of the Healthy Markets Association, which advocates for institutional investors. </p> <p>We're not sure. While commission-free trading probably won't go away entirely, brokers like Robinhood that have built their business model around PFOF would be disrupted. Whatever you might think of Robinhood et al, retail investors do appear to value their services.</p> <p>You can't ignore the regulatory politics either. Here we wonder if Gensler might end up going too big and getting nothing. His problem is that the current system <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90957187-c43e-44a7-9d70-d0218f64318f\">creates concentrated benefits and diffuse costs</a>. Market makers and brokers will fight the SEC hard. They may have the upper hand against an agency that is already stretched thin across <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff185ac0-0d1e-42bd-8053-5435b91247d2\">multiple ambitious rulemaking efforts</a>. For his part Cifu, a former lawyer, predicted “litigation for the next half dozen years”.</p> <p>Much of Gensler's market structure reform agenda is less controversial, or even popular. Including odd lots (orders of less than 100 shares) in national pricing benchmarks, allowing sub-penny pricing and requiring more disclosure from brokers and exchanges enjoy significant support from industry. This could matter. One recent <a href=\"https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=715101068095081089076097026073011010005085068040063064091026071069068095121065096126032054038038047007041074099085074024007028049023054028000114072093094030014003039087011064073098103104127064085028027090071096022070019101097019001081006124005116100&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE\">study</a> found that better prices on Amazon, Google and Tesla stock were hidden away in odd-lot orders more than half the time.</p> <p>Advocates say these are all fine but not enough. We would just ask whether going all in on overhauling this flawed but functional system is where the SEC's effort is best spent. There is nothing wrong with taking the easy wins here, to save political capital for other priorities.</p> <h1>A few good reads</h1> <p>China and the US are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73846d05-932a-47a0-997c-6f307083b912\">having</a> a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/381ff6c9-ed6c-4f3c-bacc-f02a109d048c\">tense</a> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/470e2518-410b-4e78-9106-cf881dd43028\">moment</a>. </p><p>Source: Ethan Wu 2022 'Gary Gensler's big dreams' FT.com 25 July.
