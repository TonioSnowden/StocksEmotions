  "title": "Apple to Launch Self-Service Repair Program in Early 2022; Customers will be able to fix their own devices, starting with the mobile-phone display, battery and camera, using genuine Apple parts and tools",
  "text": "<p>Apple has been known for its tight control of the repair process, focused around Apple Stores and authorized service providers.</p><p>In July, as part of an executive order addressing consumer affairs, the Biden administration encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules barring electronics makers from restricting the use of independent repair shops—or people repairing their own devices.</p><p>Apple's program would be available first for the company's most recent iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups, and would then be followed by Mac computers running on Apple's M1 chips, the company said. Apple noted that the program is \"intended for individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices,\" and that most customers would still have to visit professional repair providers.</p><p>Still, any Apple device owner with a valid device serial number can register online to order parts and conduct a self-service repair, the company said. Apple said it won't verify an applicant's technical know-how, but it will require an acknowledgment of the terms and conditions—including the possibility of voiding a warranty through damage during a repair.</p><p>There won't be a customer support phone number to call for assistance if a mistake happens, Apple said. Gadget owners can abandon their project mid-repair and take it to an Apple Store for assistance, at an additional cost.</p><p>Apple will announce pricing next year but said it plans to sell repair parts for the same prices it currently offers to independent repair shops. Customers will save on labor costs, and orders will include free shipping, the company said, but repairs might require specialized tools that cost extra.</p><p>Customers will be credited a small percentage of the purchase price if they ship broken parts back to Apple, the company said.</p><p>The service won't likely have a major impact on most Apple users, according to Gene Munster, a tech analyst and managing partner at the venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. Apple might relieve its Genius Bar repair desk of some repairs, but could also gum it up with people who fail while trying to fix their own devices, he said.</p><p>\"Most people don't want to fix their own phone. This is just largely for show and kind of appeases a very small segment of owners,\" Mr. Munster said. Apple has likely been aware of the right-to-repair movement for years, he added. The Biden administration's executive order \"might have been the final push to get Apple to do it,\" he said.</p><p>Self Service Repair will expand to additional countries throughout next year, Apple said. The company also said that it has been working on other ways to expand repair access.</p><p>\"In the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we're providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs,\" Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said.</p><p>Apple to Launch Self-Service Repair Program in Early 2022</p>",
