  "title": "In a Ukrainian Town, a Collaborator Who Worked With the Russians Now Faces Justice; The Russian-appointed mayor of Dymer tried to persuade locals to support Moscow. He was left behind as the Russians abruptly withdrew.",
  "text": "<p>Five days later, Russian forces abruptly withdrew from Dymer as they buckled under the pressure of Ukrainian resistance across northern Ukraine. They didn't take Mr. Kharchenko along. He barely survived when advancing Ukrainian units sprayed his car with bullets and is now in custody, facing trial on charges of collaboration with the enemy.</p><p>All around occupied parts of Ukraine, Russian forces have tried to find locals who would support their attempts to root out Ukrainian resistance and to install puppet administrations. In some parts of the country, particularly the south and the east where the occupation persists, they have had a degree of success, recruiting current or former mayors, council members and other prominent locals, some of whom never voiced pro-Russian views in the past.</p><p>But, by and large, the Russians have had to make do with little-known figures like Mr. Kharchenko. They have installed a janitor as deputy mayor in the southern town of Berdyansk and an antivaccine blogger as deputy governor of the occupied Kherson region.</p><p>While Mr. Kharchenko couldn't be reached in detention and nor could a legal representative be found, his mother, Iryna, said he was simply trying to aid Dymer's residents at a difficult time when official Ukrainian authorities had disappeared.</p><p>\"The same people who used to come here and say, please help us, have now turned against him,\" she said.</p><p>Ukraine has opened 914 criminal cases for treason, punishable by a life sentence in wartime, and 788 for collaboration with the enemy, punishable by 15 years in prison, since the invasion began, according to the General Prosecutor's office. Suspected collaborators still working for the Russians in occupied areas face even greater risks because Ukrainian forces see them as legitimate military targets.</p><p>When the Ukrainian military withdrew from the town of Kreminna in the eastern Donbas region last month, they booby-trapped the city hall and the police headquarters. As Russian authorities gathered there to appoint a new mayor, the buildings exploded, killing a large number of people, including some senior officials, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister who provided footage of the blasts' aftermath.</p><p>\"The majority of the Ukrainian people believe that the traitors, those who side with the enemy, strengthen them and help them occupy our territories, have to be held responsible under the laws of man and God. There can be no pity toward traitors,\" Mr. Gerashchenko said.</p><p>The case of Mr. Kharchenko, the only Russian-appointed town mayor currently known to be in Ukrainian custody, highlights the complexity of the moral choices under the Russian occupation. In Dymer, some 20 residents were killed by the Russians and more than 40 are still missing and mostly believed to be held captive in Russia, according to town authorities. Yet, residents are divided about how much to blame Mr. Kharchenko for their suffering.</p><p>Zoya Koval said her husband, Vyacheslav Kolchuz, a veteran of the Ukrainian military who fought against Russian-backed statelets established in Donbas in 2014, was detained by Russian troops in Dymer on March 11. She said she sought information about her husband's fate from Mr. Kharchenko in the following days, to no avail. She later learned her husband had been transferred to a bigger Russian base in Hostomel and then to a jail in the Bryansk region of Russia, where he likely remains today.</p><p>\"People hate him. I am surprised he's still alive,\" Ms. Koval said of Mr. Kharchenko. \"If I could, I would rip out his Adam's apple myself right now.\"</p><p>The Security Service of Ukraine, which is supervising Mr. Kharchenko's detention pending a trial, said that the Russian-appointed mayor of Dymer is suspected of providing the Russians with names of Donbas war veterans and members of the Territorial Defense, in addition to helping occupation forces in other ways. The agency said it wouldn't provide further information or make the suspect available for interview. Ukrainian law enforcement didn't release Mr. Kharchenko's name, but his identity was confirmed to The Wall Street Journal by local authorities and residents.</p><p>Mr. Kharchenko's neighbor Andriy Liskov, a retired Ukrainian soldier who kept weapons in his home, says he and many other veterans weren't bothered by the Russians during the occupation. Once the Russians arrived in town, Mr. Liskov said he warned Mr. Kharchenko that he would be killed if he informed on his neighbors. \"He used to know many people, he knew how many weapons I had,\" Mr. Liskov said. \"But he didn't tell anyone.\"</p><p>Dymer's legitimately elected mayor, Volodymyr Pidkurhannyi, said he also didn't have any evidence that Mr. Kharchenko had provided the Russians with information that led to anyone's detention.</p><p>Mr. Pidkurhannyi went into hiding when the Russians appeared in the town, rolling in from Belarus to the north on day two of the war, but said he managed to remove some of the most sensitive information from his office. \"If I stayed, the options would have been to collaborate, which I would not do, to end up in the detention cellar, or to be liquidated,\" Mr. Pidkurhannyi said. </p><p>The elected mayor of Dymer, Volodymyr Pidkurhannyi.

Mobile-phone signal reached only a few spots. Food began to run out because the roads to Kyiv had been cut after Ukrainian forces blew up a bridge south of Dymer to slow the Russian advance. The only way to evacuate people and to bring in food and medication was by making a risky crossing in small boats over the icy waters of the Kyiv Sea, the vast reservoir north of a dam on the Dnipro river.</p><p>Mr. Kharchenko and a friend decided to team up to work with the Russians on bringing humanitarian aid to Dymer, said Mr. Kharchenko's mother, Iryna.</p><p>\"All the people were hungry, there was nothing to eat here. Occupation was tough, and he was only trying to help out,\" she said, adding that her son was distressed when he learned about the leak of military files. </p><p>Zoya Koval said her workplace was used by the Russians as a base during the occupation. Her husband is still missing.

By the end of March, the situation in Dymer was dire enough for a long line of local residents to fill the main street when a shipment of food and medicine arrived with a camera crew from the Russian Defense Ministry. </p><p>Oleksander Striletsky was held prisoner after Russian soldiers found images of their positions on his phone. PHOTO: Manu Brabo for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Mr. Kharchenko showed up at the event with a bundle of Russian newspapers, wearing a baseball cap with the symbol of the U.S. Marine Corps and the motto \"The Few, The Proud.\" The Russians were creating jobs and providing the town with necessary supplies, he told the Russian military interviewer.</p><p>Russian soldiers, clad in body armor and their faces hidden, delivered packs of juice, toilet paper and canned food. One of them, a medic, handed out prescription medication for diabetes and hypertension to elderly women. \"May God help you,\" one of the women said in the recorded footage as she shuffled away.</p><p>In his new role, Mr. Kharchenko also worked with the Russians on trying to repair the gas pipeline and the electricity network, without success.</p><p>\"Every morning he would drive along the street, stop by and say: 'Hello girls, the electricity will be back on soon,'\" said a neighbor, Olena Zhyhalova. \"He was so happy he was a boss now. The man was just radiant, he had desired it so much.\"</p><p>Mr. Liskov, Mr. Kharchenko's neighbor, was summoned to the municipality for a meeting with Mr. Kharchenko and Russian officers. He had worked for the mobile-phone company Kyivstar in the past and says Mr. Kharchenko asked him to draw on a map the locations of mobile-phone towers in the region. Mr. Liskov said he responded that he didn't recall that information.</p><p>Mobile phones were becoming a critical issue for the Russians as their positions were targeted by drones, artillery and small Ukrainian resistance teams operating from nearby forests. Many locals had images of Russian positions and convoys on their phones, something that could result in detention or worse if they were caught.</p><p>Oleksandr Striletsky, a neighbor of Mr. Kharchenko, said he was trying to make a call in a spot that still had reception on March 23 when he was stopped by Russian forces. They found photos of a Russian self-propelled gun that had been destroyed in the vicinity, and of a blown-up bridge in his Viber social-media account. He said he was blindfolded and taken to a small storeroom in the Dymer metal-works plant, where he was detained alongside some 30 people. </p><p>Etchings on the wall of the building where Mr. Striletsky said he was held captive. PHOTO: Manu Brabo for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>At one point, the Russians started shooting into the ceiling, which still has pockmarks, as they tried to intimidate detainees, Mr. Striletsky said.</p><p>On April 1, after a night of shelling by advancing Ukrainian troops, the Russian unit at the metal-works factory briefly withdrew. The night watchman who remained at the facility, Vladyslav Zhukov, used the moment to unlock the storeroom's door and free the prisoners.</p><p>\"If they had come back, they would have executed us or taken us to Russia,\" Mr. Striletsky said as he visited his former cell for the first time.</p><p>The next day, the Russians were gone from Dymer for good. Mr. Kharchenko's friend escaped with them to Belarus. Why Mr. Kharchenko himself has stayed behind is a matter of debate. Iryna, his mother, said she raced to the town hall that morning, warning her son that the Russians were departing. \"He told me in response, but why should I leave? I have not done anything bad, it's my home,\" she said.</p><p>Mr. Pidkurhannyi, the mayor, says that Mr. Kharchenko was telling residents at the time that the Russians weren't really abandoning Dymer and would be back within a couple of days. \"He really believed that the Russians would be here forever,\" added Mr. Liskov.</p><p>Ms. Stankevych, the town council member, said that, to Russians, collaborators like Mr. Kharchenko were simply disposable. \"Why would they need a traitor?\" she said. \"A man who betrayed once can always betray again.\" </p><p>Dymer as it looks after the occupation.
