  "title": "World News: Hong Kong News Site Shuts After Arrests --- The demise of popular pro-democracy outlet deals another blow to the city's press freedom",
  "text": "<p>After the arrests and police raid, Stand News said it would stop operations, with its acting editor resigning and all employees immediately dismissed.</p><p>The arrests mark another assault on press freedom in the city. After Beijing imposed national security legislation on the city in June 2020, local media came under scrutiny. Pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily printed its last edition after 26 years in June this year following the arrest of senior journalists and leaders, including founder Jimmy Lai.</p><p>Senior Superintendent of the National Security Department Li Kwai-wah told reporters after the Stand News arrests that the news site continued to publish seditious content from July 2020 to November 2021, after the national security law came into effect. Mr. Li raised a few examples, including that the news site described Hong Kong protesters as having disappeared, and reported that police were pointing guns at the yellow helmets protesters were wearing during clashes and saying \"burn them all.\" Mr. Li said such articles were published with the intent to provoke hatred against the government and dissatisfaction among the community.</p><p>Mr. Li said police found HK$500,000 in cash at Stand News offices, and had frozen about HK$61 million worth of its assets. Police are investigating the source of the funds, he said.</p><p>Holding a copy of the national security law and referring to the protection of media freedom that the legislation stipulates, Mr. Li said authorities weren't targeting a specific profession, but instead anyone who broke the law.</p><p>News of the arrests emerged in a 45-second live broadcast by deputy assignment editor Ronson Chan, who also is head of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. Mr. Chan began streaming on Stand News' Facebook page as national security police showed up at his door early Wednesday, before he was told to stop filming by the officers. Mr. Chan was subsequently released.</p><p>Since it launched in late 2014 as a nonprofit successor to pro-democracy media outlet House News, Stand News has emerged as one of the city's boldest independent news organizations, with a focus on local politics. During the 2019 protests, its reporters and live streams were among the most watched.</p><p>It ranked highest in credibility among the city's online news media in a 2019 Chinese University of Hong Kong survey.</p><p>After the fall of Apple Daily in June, Stand News said it would stop running opinion pieces -- purging past articles from its website -- and cease accepting subscriptions and sponsorships as a precaution.</p><p>Those arrested Wednesday include former top editor Chung Pui-kuen, who stepped down in November citing family reasons. Police also arrested several former Stand News board members who had resigned earlier this year when the company began taking precautions to minimize its risk and protect staff. Among the group was singer Denise Ho, whose arrest was confirmed by administrators of her verified Facebook page, and barrister and former lawmaker Margaret Ng. The site's acting top editor, Patrick Lam, was also arrested. Mr. Lam, Mr. Chung and Ms. Ng couldn't be reached to comment. The message on Ms. Ho's Facebook page urged supporters not to worry.</p><p>\"The arrests . . . amount to an open assault on Hong Kong's already tattered press freedom,\" said Steven Butler, Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>",
