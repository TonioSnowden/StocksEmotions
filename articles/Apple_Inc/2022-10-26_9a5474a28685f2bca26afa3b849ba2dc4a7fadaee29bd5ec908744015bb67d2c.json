  "text": "<p>3M's stock MMM edged up 0.1% to close Tuesday at $118.50, erasing a loss of as much as 4.4% at its intraday low of $113.15. It has dropped 15.8% over the past three months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has edged up 0.2%.</p><p>In the post-earnings conference call with analysts, the company had a lot to say about what it's seeing in terms of inflation and consumer demand:</p><p>Inflation</p><p>Chief Financial Officer and Transformation Officer Monish Patolawala said inflation remains \"persistent and broad based,\" and prices for intermediate finished goods and specialty raw materials are still \"pretty high.\" But there has been some improvement.</p><p>\"Raw material, logistics and labor inflation are starting to show some signs of moderation, and we are starting to see some evidence of global supply chain stabilization,\" Patolawala said, according to a FactSet transcript.</p><p>While there is moderation, he said it hasn't been consistent.</p><p>\"So I would say if you look at what inflation we had in the third quarter, it was $225 million, and the fourth quarter, we are seeing somewhere between $100 million-$150 million,\" Patolawala said. \"So there's a little moderation.\"</p><p>Consumer spending</p><p>While industrial end demand remained \"steady,\" Patolawala said ongoing inflationary pressures led to a decline in consumer demand as the quarter progressed, particularly in consumer electronics, oral care and consumer retail.</p><p>Within consumer electronics, there was near-term softness in \"particularly smartphones, tablets and TVs,\" Patolawala said.</p><p>Read: Apple stock may not be a 'safe haven' for much longer, Bank of America warns in downgrade.</p><p>Apple Inc. AAPL will provide its rebuttal on smartphone and tablet demand when the technology behemoth reports fiscal fourth-quarter results on Oct. 27.</p><p>He added that the back-to-school season was \"softer than expected,\" hurt not only by inflation reducing consumer spend, but also by retailers \"aggressively\" cutting prices to address excess inventory.</p><p>Also read: Here's why Target was willing to pay so much to sell off excess inventory.</p><p>The company said it also witnessed \"softening demand\" in the home improvement market.</p><p>Back-to-school and home improvement retailers will get their chance to respond next month, as most report for quarters that extend through October.
