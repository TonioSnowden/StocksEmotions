  "text": "<p>   Foxconn Technology Group, the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer, said that it would acquire a semiconductor manufacturing facility, taking the company deeper into the chip business at a time of unprecedented global strain. </p><p>   Foxconn, best known as the largest assembler of Apple Inc. iPhones, said Thursday that it would buy the Taiwan-based plant, which manufactures 6-inch wafers used in cars, a purchase that it said would help secure a steady supply of auto chips as Foxconn expands further into the electric-vehicle industry. </p><p>   Foxconn, based in New Taipei, Taiwan, said in February that it would assemble cars for electric-vehicle startup Fisker Inc., and in May said it would join forces with Stellantis NV, the maker of Jeep and Chrysler, to develop in-car software. </p><p>   Foxconn's deal with Macronix International -- based in Hsinchu, Taiwan -- is small, worth the equivalent of about $91 million. But it positions Foxconn to jump into production of a certain kind of semiconductor that is emerging as a leading technology in the electric-vehicle industry. </p><p>   The 6-inch wafers manufactured at the plant are used primarily for making car-chip components made of silicon carbide, a material that is regarded as offering better performance than traditional silicon for some tasks, such as fast charging. U.S. electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. began using silicon carbide components in 2018, making it one of the first in the industry. </p><p>   Foxconn's acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the year, the two companies said. Young Liu, Foxconn's chairman, said the plant would be able to supply 30,000 e-vehicles a month. </p><p></p>",
