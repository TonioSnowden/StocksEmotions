  "text": "<p>A paper published last year in the Journal of Business Research analyzed more than 100 companies from the CB Insights unicorns list in 2018 and compared them with similar startups that didn't reach a billion-dollar threshold.</p><p>Researchers at the Institute of Entrepreneurship at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany hypothesized that the reputation of the lead first-round investor would be a predictor of which companies eventually became unicorns. As a proxy for reputation, they looked at the share of IPOs backed by the same investor over the prior 18 years.</p><p>Their hypothesis didn't pan out.</p><p>Their paper went on to suggest that reputation remains a fuzzy concept despite having been shown previously to matter in venture markets. \"As we cannot find this effect to be significant in our analysis, we assume that this is due to the fact that the construct of investor reputation is hardly measurable,\" the authors wrote.</p><p>The research may help new venture investors without an IPO track record and may help persuade founders that they have some other winning capability.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Growth investment.
