  "title": "Activist investor urges Peloton to fire chief and explore sale",
  "text": "<p>Peloton has come under attack from an activist investor who has demanded that the maker of connected fitness bikes and treadmills sack its chief executive and explore a sale of the company, after its share price collapsed more than 80 per cent over the past year. &#xa0;</p> <p>Blackwells Capital, which owns less than 5 per cent of Peloton, accused its co-founder John Foley of losing $40bn in shareholders' wealth due to alleged mismanagement, including misleading investors and hiring his wife in an executive role.</p> <p>The move comes as Peloton, one of the companies that benefited most from lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, suffered a near-25 per cent drop in its share price last week after <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/20/peloton-to-pause-production-of-its-bikes-treadmills-as-demand-wanes.html\">CNBC reported</a> it planned to halt production because of low demand. </p> <p>Foley later informed employees that Peloton was considering downsizing its workforce and overall production as a result of the adverse consumer demand conditions. </p> <p>“Remarkably, the company is on worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic, with high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders,” said Jason Aintabi, chief investment officer at Blackwells, in a letter to the board. </p> <p>“The company has gotten too big, too complex and too damaged for Mr Foley to lead it. And he should have enough self-awareness and enough self-interest, to resign as a director,” the investor added.</p> <p>Blackwells would need support from Foley and other insiders for its demands to be met, due to Peloton's dual-class shareholder structure, which gives them effective control over the company. </p> <p>Peloton directors and executives have a majority of the voting rights as owners of Class B shares that are worth 20 times the voting rights of those held by ordinary shareholders.</p> <p>Aintabi is best known for taking on Tom Barrack, the real estate investor and close friend of former US president Donald Trump, in 2019 for his record at Colony Capital. Barrack was later forced to step down. </p> <p>Blackwells' demand to explore a sale also comes at a time when several investment bankers have been speculating that Peloton could be an acquisition target for a variety of companies, ranging from Apple to Nike, as well as deep-pocketed private equity groups.</p> <p>“Undoubtedly, Peloton and its customer base would be extremely attractive&#xa0;to any number of technology, streaming, metaverse and sportswear companies (eg: Apple, Disney, Sony, Nike), who could extend their presence in the home, in health and wellness and on the screen through Peloton,” said Aintabi.</p> <p>“Given the mess that Peloton has become as an independent company, we are convinced that one or more of these strategic acquirers could provide significantly more value, with substantially less risk, than Peloton is likely to generate for its shareholders on its own.”</p> <p>Blackwells' attack comes after Peloton faced a reputational hit in a recent episode of the popular TV show <em>Billions</em>, where a leading character suffered a heart attack while using one of the company's exercise bikes. </p> <p>It was the second time Peloton was negatively featured in a TV show, as last year a central character in <em>Sex and the City</em> died after using the expensive fitness machine. </p> <p>Peloton did not immediately respond to the criticism from Blackwells.</p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan in New York and Patrick McGee in San Francisco 2022 'Activist investor urges Peloton to fire chief and explore sale' FT.com 24 January.
