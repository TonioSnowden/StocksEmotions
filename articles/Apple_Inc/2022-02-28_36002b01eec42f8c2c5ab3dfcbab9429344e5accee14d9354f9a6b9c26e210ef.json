  "text": "<p>At the start of <em>Shamima Begum: The Blame Game,</em> a new podcast from ITV News, the presenter Rohit Kachroo sets out his stall. The plan, he explains, is to discover who was responsible for 15-year-old Shamima Begum leaving London for Syria, alongside two school friends, to join Isis. “Shamima lost three babies and then her citizenship too,” he barks. “But should she take all the blame?”</p> <p>At this point, I was tempted to switch off. Since Begum, who is now 22, fled the UK, her case has been the subject of inflammatory debate in newspaper op-eds, TV chat shows and radio phone-in programmes. Everyone seems to have an opinion on the so-called “jihadi bride” who was radicalised online and was a child when she married a Dutch Isis fighter. We surely don't need a finger-pointing podcast to add to the noise. But listening is my job, so I pressed on. And although the framing of this four-part series is off-putting — does it really need a clip of Piers Morgan sounding off about Begum in the intro? — it offers a more detailed account of the circumstances that led to her departing for Syria than we are used to.</p> <p>Kachroo is global security editor at ITV News. Given the network's extensive coverage of Begum over the years, he could easily have cobbled together a podcast from the archives. But while older audio is used — the most notable being Kachroo's interview with Begum conducted in north-east Syria in 2019 — there is fresh material too. The presenter looks at the individuals and institutions in a position to intervene before Begum fled, among them her family, her school, the local council and the police. We learn how small oversights had big consequences, such as the letter sent out to parents at Begum's school regarding another pupil who had left to join Isis a few weeks earlier. Rather than being sent directly, the letter was given to children to pass on to their parents; Begum opted to hide hers in a textbook.</p> <p>What is clear from the series is that apportioning sole blame is impossible since Begum's actions were the result of a confluence of events and failures. Kachroo talks to Richard Walton, former head of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism unit, who bullishly rejects the suggestion that police missed opportunities to find Begum before she arrived in Syria, claiming theirs was a “textbook investigation”. We also meet Puru Mia, a councillor for London's Mile End, who claims “dysfunctionality” within Begum's local authority, which declined to perform a serious case review even after one of her travel companions, Kadiza Sultana, was reported dead. </p> <p>But the most arresting comment comes from Begum herself in the final episode as she reflects on how her case gripped the media and made her a political pawn. “I didn't make myself a poster girl,” she says. “Isis did not make me a poster girl. The UK made me a poster girl.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/shamima-begum-the-blame-game/id1608169845\"><em>podcasts.apple.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2022 'Shamima Begum: The Blame Game — podcast sheds light on the ‘jihadi bride'' FT.com 28 February.
