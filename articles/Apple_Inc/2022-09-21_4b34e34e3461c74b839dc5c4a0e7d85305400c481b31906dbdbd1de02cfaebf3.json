  "text": "<p>   \"Serial\" leapt up podcast charts a day after a judge vacated the murder conviction of Adnan Syed, whose case was the center of the show's first season eight years ago. </p><p>   \"Serial\" became a cultural phenomenon when it was released in 2014, helping popularize podcasts and leading to a wave of other true-crime shows like it. New York Times Co. bought the production company behind \"Serial\" in 2020. </p><p>   The podcast was the No. 1 show in the U.S. on Apple Inc.'s platform Tuesday afternoon after the release of a new 17-minute episode called \"Adnan Is Out.\" It was the 26th most popular podcast on Spotify Technology SA's U.S. list. </p><p>   Mr. Syed was convicted in 2000 for the murder of Hae Min Lee, an 18-year-old high-school student and his ex-girlfriend. Mr. Syed was 17 years old at the time of the crime and was charged as an adult. He had been serving a life sentence. </p><p>   The first season of \"Serial\" and a later HBO docuseries raised questions about Mr. Syed's involvement in the strangling of Ms. Lee in 1999, helping spur attempts to revive his case in recent years. </p><p>   \"You might be asking, what on Earth happened?\" Sarah Koenig, the host of \"Serial,\" said in the episode Tuesday. \"I've spent the last few days trying to understand it myself.\" </p><p>   Last week, the state's attorney for Baltimore city asked the court to vacate Mr. Syed's first-degree murder conviction, saying a nearly yearlong investigation had revealed new evidence. </p><p>   The third season of \"Serial\" -- its most recent season -- was released in 2018. </p><p>   A representative for the podcast didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p></p>",
