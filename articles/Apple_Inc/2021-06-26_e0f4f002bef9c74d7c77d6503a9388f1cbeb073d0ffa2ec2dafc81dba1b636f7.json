  "text": "<p>\n  Nobody has to listen to Steely Dan. But Streaming HD versions of songs you know well, especially blue-chip recordings from the '50s-to-'80s heyday of analog, gives you ample opportunity to have \"wow I never noticed that before\" revelations. Still, new music that you may only have ever heard streamed can be similarly revelatory. The \"Song Exploder\" podcast often highlights exactly the kinds of details you might only find through close listening to a high-quality recording. When Billie Eilish and her brother and creative partner Finneas appeared on the podcast to talk about the song \"Everything I Wanted,\" Ms. Eilish noted that the layers of often-whispered backing vocals were features that \"you wouldn't notice if somebody didn't play them isolated.\" With uncompressed and high-resolution streaming, those vocals intertwine with each other right at the edge of audibility, each distinct and noticeable, lending the song sonic depth and detail most listeners were unlikely to truly hear until now. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  HOW TO GET HI-RES AT HOME / FROM THE SPECTACULAR TO THE SIMPLE, THIS GEAR WILL GET HD STREAMS INTO YOUR EARS </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  1. If you want to ask Alexa to stream Amazon Music at its full, 24-bit 192khz Ultra HD rate, the Denon Home 250 wireless speaker is up to the task. The integrated HEOS system also gives you access to services like Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora and TIDAL, as well as AirPlay 2 connectivity. $499, denon.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2. Schiit takes its sound, but not itself, seriously. Its combination DAC and headphone amplifier, the Schiit Fulla (think about it) is simplicity itself: a fat volume knob on a small steel box the size of a deck of cards. It's ideally suited to desktop use, making music streamed from your computer or phone sound big as life. $109, schiit.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  3. Naim's Uniti Atom Headphone Edition streaming music player sounds as good as it looks. Created for solo listening, but able to be integrated with a larger sound system, it features connections and power enough to drive any headphones you might connect. $3,290, naimaudio.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  4. Plug a pair of speakers into Bluesound's Powernode and download the company's app (which is the smoothest thing this side of Sonos) and you'll have a shockingly good streaming stereo system up and running in minutes. If you already have a stereo, connect its Node model, which omits the amplifier, for $350 less. $899, bluesound.com </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  How to Get Hi-Res on the Go </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  To listen to lossless music from your phone on the move, you'll need two things: an external digital to analog converter (or DAC), and wired headphones to connect to it. Here, our favorites. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  GO SMALL </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  ddHifi TC 35 Pro Dongle </p><p>\n  Just plug this lightweight, elegantly designed dongle into your phone's charging port and connect your headphones to listen to full-resolution music on the go. $95, audio46.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Campfire Audio Satsuma </p><p>\n  Big sounds can come from small packages. These new, in-ear monitors put the Portland company's signature, 3D-printed acoustic chamber into a striking and affordable package. $199, campfireaudio.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  GO SLIGHTLY BIGGER </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  iFi Hip-Dac </p><p>\n  To power a pair of chunky cans, you'll want something substantial like iFi's combination DAC and amplifier. (Named for its flask-like shape and size, not because it listens to King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard.) $150, ifi-audio.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Drop + Dan Clark Audio Aeon Closed X </p><p>\n  For some, there's no beating the comfort and cocooning of big, over-the-ear headphones. These clearly render even music's finest details. $479, drop.com </p><p></p>",
