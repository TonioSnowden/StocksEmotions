  "text": "<p>   Smartphone demand in China is rapidly cooling as the pandemic's resurgence dents consumer spending, prompting warnings in recent weeks from handset makers including Apple Inc. as well as chip makers about the world's biggest smartphone market. </p><p>   Smartphone shipments in China fell 34% in April from a year ago to 17.7 million units, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed this week. For the first four months of the year, shipments declined 30% to about 86 million units, said the academy, which is affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. </p><p>   In April, Apple warned that the resurgence of Covid-19 in China threatens to hinder sales by as much as $8 billion this quarter. This month, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. said its January-March smartphone revenue declined 11% from the year-earlier period and partly blamed closed stores and component shortages that stemmed from the country's rigid Covid-control policies. </p><p>   Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China's biggest contract semiconductor maker and a producer of smartphone chips, said this month that it now expects global smartphone makers to produce at least 200 million fewer units of smartphones in 2022 compared with industry forecasts. Most of those cuts come from Chinese phone makers, said Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-chief executive. </p><p>   \"There is no end in sight to the downtrends,\" Mr. Zhao said in an earnings call. </p><p>   The decline in smartphone demand is among the factors driving the deceleration in the world's second-biggest economy and inflicting pain on global electronics makers. </p><p>   The impact of Covid-19 restrictions -- including lockdowns at industrial hubs -- has rippled through the economy, disrupting supply chains as well as damping consumption. </p><p></p>",
