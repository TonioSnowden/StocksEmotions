DD subscribers can register for free <a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/377854/home\">here</a>.</p> <h2>As more private equity firms go public, smaller players face a big decision</h2> <p>2021 was a good year to be a listed private equity group. </p> <p>A selection of 11 publicly traded players including US behemoths <strong>Blackstone </strong>and<strong> Apollo </strong>and Europe's <strong>EQT </strong>and <strong>Bridgepoint</strong> collectively gained almost $240bn in market value. </p> <p>So it's little surprise that a growing number of firms are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8da614e-c2c8-4769-a302-1be39620f957\">following suit</a>, or at least thinking about it. </p> <p><strong>TPG </strong>is planning to float this month.<strong> CVC Capital Partners</strong>, <strong>Ardian</strong> and <strong>L Catterton</strong> have all had conversations with advisers about potential initial public offerings. </p> <p>Several of the biggest players had a rocky start to life on the public markets, often trading below their IPO price in their early years. But they are surging now — and have used their time as listed entities to become sprawling, diversified asset managers.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8247140.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>That leaves smaller unlisted rivals at a crossroads: to stand a chance at keeping up, they'll need to bring in outside capital somehow. Or they must accept their fate as smaller, more specialised players. &#xa0;</p> <p>“The market is consolidating and the larger platforms are getting larger,” <strong>Michael Arougheti</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Ares Management</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8da614e-c2c8-4769-a302-1be39620f957\">told DD's Antoine Gara and Kaye Wiggins</a>. “A lot of smaller managers are feeling disadvantaged.”</p> <p><strong>Hellman &amp; Friedman</strong>, <strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong> and <strong>Advent International</strong> seem to be sticking to their roots as privately held shops that focus mostly on leveraged buyouts. So far, so is <strong>Thoma Bravo</strong>, whose co-founder <strong>Orlando Bravo</strong> told us that “to pursue our strategic mission, we don't need outside capital right now” — before adding that this could change. </p> <p>The pitch to stock market investors is relatively simple: they're buying into a future stream of management fee income, which grows as the buyout group raises more, and larger, funds to deploy. Shareholders seem to like the relative predictability this provides. </p> <p>Luckily for private equity dealmakers, that means they can keep to themselves the lion's share of performance fees — often the most lucrative stream of revenue. <strong>TPG</strong> has seized on this, restructuring its finances to give shareholders a greater claim to net management fees and dealmakers a greater claim to performance fees. </p> <p>Another reason for European firms to think about listing now: unlike in the US, European regulators don't seem to be demanding full transparency about how much money top executives are making.</p> <p>While Paris-listed <strong>Eurazeo </strong>does disclose carried interest payouts (chief executive <strong>Virginie Morgon</strong> pocketed €12.7m in 2016 on top of a €3.1m salary), EQT, <strong>Antin Infrastructure </strong>and Bridgepoint keep the figures under wraps. </p> <p>That would be unthinkable in the US, where full disclosure of how much money bosses take home is seen as fundamental to the capitalist system. </p> <p>Not in Europe, though. “It's an industry, particularly in the UK, which is obsessed with secrecy,” said <strong>Alain Rauscher</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Antin</strong>. “People don't want to communicate about their carried interest . . . You have some tabloid press who are going to make a big fuss about it.”</p> <h2>Credit Suisse squares off against SoftBank</h2> <p>SoftBank's <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong> has denied “all knowledge” of a controversial deal involving <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>. But <strong>Lex Greensill</strong> said in an email that Masa was “personally sighted on the issue”.</p> <p>That's according to US legal filings from <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>. </p> <p>The Swiss lender, which has been scrambling to recoup losses for its angry clients following Greensill's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\"> well-documented implosion</a>, has pointed to what it calls a “material discrepancy” between the two. It launched legal action against SoftBank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0a984fc-9c97-4cc9-95b0-b530bee6672d\">last month</a>.</p> <p>The dispute centres on $440m in funds that the bank's wealthy customers are owed by <strong>Katerra</strong>, a now-bankrupt US construction group and Greensill client that was backed by SoftBank's Vision Fund.</p> <p>In late 2020, SoftBank agreed to give Greensill — which had lent Katerra money originally supplied by Credit Suisse clients — an emergency cash injection. (Katerra was included in Credit Suisse's Greensill supply-chain finance funds, which bundled invoices into investments and marketed them as low-risk.)</p> <p>But as the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2a6d829-f27e-4668-bcc0-14cc2441fa17\">revealed last year</a>, Credit Suisse never received the money.</p> <p>In its filings, the Swiss bank says Son denied “all knowledge of the Katerra” deal during a meeting with its chief <strong>Thomas Gottstein</strong> last September. But, it adds, an email sent by the Australian financier <strong>Lex Greensill</strong> in December 2019 said Masa was “personally sighted on the issue.”</p> <p>The bank also claims that Lex Greensill gave a presentation to Son in October 2020 in which he discussed the Katerra restructuring. </p> <p>“In light of these facts, Mr Son's stance in his meeting with Mr Gottstein is surprising and requires explanation,” according to a letter from the Swiss bank to SoftBank cited in the filings. </p> <p>SoftBank seems unfazed. “Credit Suisse has been threatening to commence legal proceedings against SoftBank for the past six months, but has not done so — for the simple reason it has no evidence to support its fanciful claims,” the Japanese group said in a statement to the FT.</p> <p>The saga has frozen relations between the two companies. SoftBank was once a key client of Credit Suisse, and Son himself was a longtime client of the bank.</p> <p>The Japanese tech investor is “in the middle of a blizzard”, Son declared <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22ad1bae-7829-409b-bb69-ec8db8235b82\">in November</a>. The temperature has just plummeted even further.</p> <h2>Help wanted: London law firms squeezed by staff shortages</h2> <p>The magic circle seems to have lost its, er, magic touch.</p> <p>London-based law firms are struggling to fill job vacancies, the FT's Kate Beioley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06ff299e-4114-4710-becf-c4f1590f8efe\">reports</a>, as soaring demand for legal services and an exodus from the industry sends headcounts plunging.</p> <p>It's no secret that dealmakers have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/071c6656-8b3f-4475-9b3d-db0e4918baaf\">weighing their golden handcuffs</a> for some time, particularly at elite law firms where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dfdd78a-e229-4524-a400-144396524eb6\">record M&amp;A activity</a> has left lawyers working gruelling hours and facing towering workloads.</p> <p>In some cases, the deals frenzy has caused lawyers to experience <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4006248-eb05-49d2-a938-d70118c4ce1b\">debilitating burnout</a> and other mental health issues. A survey of more than 1,700 lawyers published in September by <strong>LawCare</strong>, a mental health charity, found that nearly 70 per cent of respondents experienced ill health in 2021 including depression and anxiety.</p> <p>Even sky-high retention bonuses (<strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> offered associates up to $250,000 to join the firm or stick around) and supercharged pay rises haven't slowed attrition rates, as firms struggle to fill the void.</p> <p>Associates have now found themselves armed with unprecedented bargaining power. In some cases, lawyers can “name their price” not to walk out the door, said <strong>Daniel Harris</strong>, associate director at recruiter <strong>Robert Walters</strong>.</p> <p>As the cost of talent keeps rising, DD wonders whether even the City's most prestigious firms will be able to foot the bill.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <p><strong>PJT Partners</strong> has hired <strong>Hugo Baring</strong> as a partner, according to people familiar with the matter. He is currently head of TMT investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>. PJT also hired <strong>John Allan</strong>, former chief executive of logistics company <strong>Exel</strong>, as a senior adviser based in London, according to an internal memo.</p> <p><strong>KKR</strong> has appointed<strong> Ryan Stork </strong>as chief operating officer. He joins from <strong>BlackRock </strong>where he was deputy chief operating officer. The private equity firm also appointed former <strong>Benchmark</strong> general partner <strong>Matthew Cohler</strong> to its board of directors. </p> <p><strong>Jefferies</strong> has appointed<strong> Philip Yates</strong> as vice-chair of its UK investment banking unit. </p> <p><strong>TPG </strong>has appointed <strong>Matt Jones</strong> as co-managing partner of<strong> TPG GP Solutions</strong>, the firm's US and European secondaries business, based in London.</p> <p><strong>Teneo </strong>managing director<strong> Matt Denham</strong> has joined PR agency <strong>Headland </strong>as a partner. Headland also <a href=\"https://www.headlandconsultancy.com/headland-appoints-five-new-partners/\">promoted</a> four directors to partners. </p> <p>US football star<strong> Eli Manning</strong> has joined private equity firm <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1780345D:US\"><strong>Brand Velocity Partners</strong></a> as a partner.</p> <p><strong>Houlihan Lokey</strong> has hired <strong>Rouzbeh Fazlinejad </strong>as a managing director of its oil and gas team in Dubai, marking the investment bank's industry group in the Middle East. He was previously head of M&amp;A at<strong> Berenberg</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Axel Springer</strong>, the German publisher that recently acquired <strong>Politico </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34c2f5b4-a2d4-45cf-a67d-277fc1d84812\">for about $1bn</a>, has hired <strong>Goli Sheikholeslami, New York Public Radio</strong>'s president and chief executive, as Politico Media Group's new chief executive. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-press/2022/01/10/goli-sheikholeslami-appointed-ceo-of-politico-media-group-1529111\">She starts</a> in February. </p> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Billionaire on a budget </strong>Since his investment in beauty brand Revlon turned ugly, New York's tabloid-famous dealmaker Ron Perelman's money troubles have placed his highly leveraged lifestyle in the spotlight.
