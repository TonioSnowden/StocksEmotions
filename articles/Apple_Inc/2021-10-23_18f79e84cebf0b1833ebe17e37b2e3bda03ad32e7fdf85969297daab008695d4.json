  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Music Publishers Seek More Payment --- Song owners and songwriters ask for higher rates from streaming services",
  "text": "<p>The National Music Publishers Association and five major streamers -- Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube and Sirius XM Holdings Inc.'s Pandora -- have been duking it out in front of the Copyright Royalty Board, a three-judge panel that sets the statutory licensing rates that digital-service providers pay publishers for on-demand audio streams of their songs. The publishers argued in proposals that were due Wednesday at midnight for nearly doubling the current rate, while the streamers are angling to pay less -- rates effectively below 2008 levels.</p><p>For years, publishers and songwriters have bristled over payments from streaming and say they are paltry -- about one-fifth what labels and recording artists collect. The NMPA proposed raising the rate to 40% of what labels are paid.</p><p>\"This would start to correct the imbalance in terms of how streaming money is divided among the parties,\" the trade group's chief executive, David Israelite, said in an interview.</p><p>Garrett Levin, chief executive of the Digital Music Association, which represents the streaming companies, pointed to a flood of investment in artists' catalogs and the highly competitive landscape for music, highlighting that streaming has helped turn around the fortunes of the music business -- for artists, publishers and labels alike.</p><p>\"How do we make modern music economics work for everyone?\" he said. \"That should be our focus -- preserving long-term industry growth and ensuring that it benefits as many people as possible.\"</p><p>Financial players such as Blackstone Inc. and KKR &amp; Co. have bet billions on song catalogs -- assets now seen as both increasingly valuable thanks to the growth of online streaming and untethered to broader market fluctuations.</p><p>The current copyright-board proceedings establish the rate for compulsory mechanical royalties earned whenever a song is reproduced in an on-demand stream format. The rate is set by the three judges every five years. The publishers' and streaming services' proposals for 2023-27 are expected to be made public in the coming days.</p><p>The NMPA has proposed that in a given reporting period, streamers pay publishers whichever is the largest of four sums: 20% of their service's revenue; 40% of what is paid to record labels and other master recording copyright holders; $1.50 per subscriber; or $0.0015 per stream.</p><p>While each service has put forward its own proposal, Mr. Israelite says all five represent a less-lucrative rate structure for publishers than the 10.5% of revenue set during the proceedings in 2008.</p><p>The tussle over future publishing payments is happening while current rates are still in flux. After the publishers won a 44% increase for 2018-22 -- to 15.5% of streaming services' overall revenue in the final year of the period -- Spotify, Amazon, YouTube and Pandora appealed the decision, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last year told the copyright board to try again.</p><p>While the parties have agreed that when the rate is determined, it will apply retroactively, the streaming services meanwhile are generally paying under the 2017 rate structure, or 10.5%.</p><p>YouTube said it isn't seeking lower rates in the 2023-27 proceeding. The other services didn't respond or declined to comment.</p>",
