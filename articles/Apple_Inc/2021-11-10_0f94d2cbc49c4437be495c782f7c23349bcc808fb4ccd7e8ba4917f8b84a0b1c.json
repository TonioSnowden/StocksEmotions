  "title": "Miners Have a Pesky Pollution Problem: Their Customers; Mining companies face pressure to reduce emissions produced by those who buy their commodities, but say their clients can't be controlled",
  "text": "<p>Ground zero for this fight is steelmaking, which is responsible for 7% of world-wide carbon-dioxide emissions from energy consumption, according to the International Energy Agency. Global miners including Rio Tinto PLC and BHP Group Ltd. make most of their earnings from selling iron ore to steel producers.</p><p>Rio Tinto recently committed to spend $7.5 billion to cut emissions from its own operations by 50% this decade, but it stopped short of imposing targets on customers' pollution.</p><p>Separately, a climate plan released by BHP wasn't backed by 17% of proxy votes at its annual shareholder meeting in London on Oct. 14. Glass, Lewis &amp; Co., a proxy adviser, recommended shareholders vote against BHP's climate proposal, partly because the miner's plan to tackle Scope 3 emissions—pollution mostly created when customers burn or process its commodities—was vague.</p><p>\"Our message to Rio and other companies is that Scope 3 emissions represent both potential counterparty and reputational risk for companies,\" said Debby Blakey, chief executive of Hesta, an Australian pension fund. \"Failure to effectively manage these risks could negatively impact a company's long-term value and their ongoing social license to operate.\"</p><p>The world's biggest miners are increasingly collaborating with steelmakers to find ways to make steel production less polluting. But miners say they need the steel industry to map out a pathway to achieving net-zero emissions.</p><p>Some believe it is the responsibility of miners to find a solution, said Rohitesh Dhawan, chief executive of the International Council on Mining and Metals, an industry group that counts BHP, Rio Tinto and Glencore PLC as members.</p><p>\"There's little you can do, without being a steel producer, to reduce emissions of steel production,\" Mr. Dhawan said.</p><p>The World Steel Association, whose members represent about 85% of global steel production, said the industry is committed to reducing its carbon footprint, but that breakthrough technologies are needed to cut emissions materially.</p><p>Mining companies say they can't ignore the problem of their customers' emissions. Without iron ore and metallurgical coal, the world wouldn't be able to make the steel that it needs for apartments, bridges and other infrastructure. Yet more than 70% of Rio Tinto's Scope 3 emissions come from customers turning its iron ore into steel.</p><p>Some miners have set targets. Brazilian iron-ore producer Vale SA wants to cut net Scope 3 emissions by 15% by 2035 and recently created a new briquette that it says produces less pollution when used in steelmaking. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. aims to have neutral Scope 3 emissions by 2040, including through investment in clean hydrogen.</p><p>Anglo American PLC, which also produces some iron ore and steelmaking coal, last month said it would aim for a 50% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2040, although the miner said that would largely depend on the pace of decarbonization in the steel industry.</p><p>Miners that are slow to act could lose business, according to investors and mining executives. Influential consumer brands are pushing suppliers to deliver carbon-free commodities. Apple Inc. last year said that by 2030 every device it sells will have been produced with no net release of carbon into the atmosphere.</p><p>Some mining executives say they fear inaction could make them a target of activist investors already taking on the oil industry. Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC recently took a large stake in Royal Dutch Shell PLC and is urging the oil giant to separate into two companies. Engine No. 1 LLC this year convinced Wall Street money managers to back a change in board oversight at Exxon Mobil Corp.</p><p>BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, is also pressing companies on climate issues. In a July report, BlackRock said it has asked miners, among others, how they will contribute to decarbonization and work toward Scope 3 disclosures and targets.</p><p>But mining executives say steel is an industry that will be especially hard to clean up, with potential new processes mostly yet to be tested at scale.</p><p>\"I cannot go out with integrity and commit to something that is still as early-stage as the decarbonization of steelmaking,\" BHP Chief Executive Mike Henry said recently. \"Now, that does not mean we can ignore it.\"</p><p>BHP's efforts have drawn criticism from shareholder-advocacy organization Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which said the miner generated profit of $11.3 billion in the 12 months through June but allocated just $65 million to help steelmaking become less polluting.</p><p>Related Coverage</p><p>* Miners Labor to Find Enough Truck Drivers, Workers</p><p>* BHP Bets on Lower-Carbon World With Petroleum Exit, $5.7 Billion Potash Project</p><p>* Coal Is a Gold Mine for Producers After Blistering Rally</p><p>Smaller miners say it is even tougher for them to influence customers. \"When you account for 2% of global met-coal sales, it's pretty hard to exercise any clout,\" said Karen Wood, chairwoman of South32 Ltd., which is considering a Scope 3 target.</p><p>In Europe, steel companies are intensifying efforts to cut carbon emissions. In August, Sweden's SSAB AB shipped what it said was the world's first commercial shipment of steel made without fossil fuels to truck maker Volvo AB.</p><p>But progress is slower in Asia, where most steel is made. Asian steelmakers rely on the coal-intensive blast furnace process and because their plants are relatively new, there is less appetite to spend money to make their processes fossil-fuel free.</p><p>Miners can help lower Scope 3 emissions themselves in small ways, including by producing ore with a higher iron content and fewer impurities, which requires less coal when turned into steel, or by removing moisture from coal.</p><p>At a pilot plant in Germany, Rio Tinto is experimenting with raw biomass, such as the husks left in the field after a corn harvest, and microwave technology to convert iron ore to metallic iron without using coal. But commercializing that technology would rely on accessing enough biomass, which critics of the energy source say can cause deforestation and affect food supply.</p><p>Rio Tinto's current strategy is to work with customers on carbon-free steel and invest in technologies that could cut the emissions intensity of steelmaking by at least 30% from 2030. Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm said Rio Tinto's annual report next year could have clearer Scope 3 ambitions.</p><p>\"We need to make a good assessment of how much is the steel industry actually doing, because obviously we're depending on that,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com</p><p>Miners Have a Pesky Pollution Problem: Their Customers</p>",
