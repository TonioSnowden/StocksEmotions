  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Design & Decorating:  Pros Within Reach  ---  A new online service lets you hire A-list interior designers for a  timed rate -- and makes once-inaccessible advice a reality.  ----  By Catherine Dash",
  "text": "<p>   Many Americans dream of hiring an ace decorator to spiff up their digs, but most of us assume, reasonably enough, that top designers only undertake big-budget projects and that the process involves retainers, markups and contracts. </p><p>   This intimidating world was the one Los Angeles interior designer Jake Arnold inhabited. That is, until this year, when Mr. Arnold, whose clients include actors Rashida Jones and Aaron Paul, launched the Expert, an online platform where the not-rich can book timed consultations with sought-after designers. </p><p>   A few weeks after lockdown began in March 2020, a spike in requests for advice via Mr. Arnold's Instagram planted an idea in the head of his friend, tech entrepreneur Leo Seigal. \"It became obvious that maybe we could use these newly normalized tools, like Zoom and video chat, to satisfy this need,\" said Mr. Seigal. By this February, the pair had enlisted an impressive lineup of designers from all over the world -- from industry luminaries like London's Martin Brudnizki to emerging names like L.A.'s modern traditionalist Ginny Macdonald, and the Expert debuted. </p><p>   Visitors to the site can peruse the portfolios, bios, services and rates of 100 designers, then book 25- or 55-minute sessions, which range in price from $200 to $2,500. Clients then share their goals -- including aspirational images and wish-list products, which designers can review before the meeting. Bobby Berk, resident designer on Netflix's \"Queer Eye\" and a member of the Expert roster observed, \"The people I find get the most out of their money have a floor plan ready and have taken photos or videos of the spaces they have questions about.\" Clients can grab screenshots and ask to record sessions. </p><p>   Patrick Herning, an Expert client who worked with Seattle designer Brian Paquette on the living room of his L.A. home, wanted to address a smoke stain over his fireplace, a rug that wasn't masking puppy accidents, window treatments and art placement. At the start of his call, he shared a Word document that included a rudimentary floor plan, a basic rendering of the room's furniture layout, iPhone photos and dimensions of his art. After the 55-minute session, which cost $750, Mr. Herning had his guardrails. Mr. Paquette suggested painting the fireplace and its surrounding wall a dark color; starting the Roman shades at the ceiling rather than at the top of the windows; and laying a distressed, antique Turkish rug. Mr. Herning implemented all of it. \"Painting out the entire wall was brilliant, and in a million years, that never would have occurred to me,\" he said. Given the costly mistakes he might have made, he found the fee well worth it. \"It's like insurance.\" He also noted that no one made money on his purchases, \"so it feels like an unbiased recommendation.\" </p><p>   While the pandemic might have spawned the Expert, designers don't see it floundering when the world opens up. \"I think it will thrive,\" said New York designer Robert Stilin, whose rate is the highest on the platform, at $2,500 for 55 minutes. \"I'm normally accessible to such a minute population of people, and this is more democratic.\" Designers are happy for a new revenue stream that requires little commitment. \"A lot of designers are not necessarily treated the best all the time, so it's nice when someone is all ears,\" said Mr. Arnold. </p><p>   Parasaran Raman had ambitious goals for his $1,000, 55-minute consultation with Mr. Berk. Working on a newly built home in the Seattle suburbs, Mr. Raman and his wife were experiencing decision fatigue. They had five topics to address with Mr. Berk and dedicated 10 minutes to each. The session kicked off with some back-and-forth between Mr. Berk and the couple. Mr. Raman, who rarely hosts sit-down dinners, wanted to turn the dining room into a bar. A compromise was reached when the designer suggested a counter-height table and bar stools. Starting the call with a debate helped ease Mr. Raman's star-struck feelings -- and the trio efficiently worked through the list of issues. </p><p>   \"I'm just a regular guy. I'm sitting here in my house just like you are,\" said Mr. Berk. </p><p>   The remote method does have its drawbacks. Mr. Raman found it challenging to assess how colors and textures would look in real life. Interior designer Joy Moyler, in New Rochelle, N.Y., works around the color issue with her Expert clients by referring to Benjamin Moore's easily obtainable paint deck. </p><p>   Jody McGowan tried out the platform this February, hiring L.A. designer Kevin Isbell for one 55-minute, $500 session. She has met with him nearly every week since, working through the terrace, primary bedroom and family room of her Bethesda, Md., home, with no plan to stop. </p><p></p>",
