  "title": "U.S. News -- 2022 Election: Fetterman's Debate Showing Worries Some in His Party",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Fetterman suffered a stroke in May that he has said didn't affect his cognitive skills but left him with challenges in processing language and, at times, articulating words.</p><p>\"I wanted to cry. It was very difficult to watch,\" said Larry Ceisler, a Democrat and statewide public-affairs consultant in Philadelphia, who supports Mr. Fetterman.</p><p>David Axelrod, a top Democratic strategist who led both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, said on Twitter that Mr. Fetterman failed on his primary debate goal. \"Fetterman needed to show he's sufficiently recovered, and this debate surely did not help,\" he wrote.</p><p>Democrats have long considered winning the Pennsylvania seat, now held by the GOP, as key to their hopes of preserving their control of the Senate. A win there would offset a potential loss by a Democratic incumbent in a chamber currently 50-50.</p><p>Joseph DiSarro, who until recently was a member of the Pennsylvania Republican Party state committee, said that for the Fetterman campaign, \"It was a huge, catastrophic mistake to debate.\" He added that undecided voters are likely to find Mr. Fetterman's performance was lacking.</p><p>But Mr. DiSarro, a political-science professor at Washington &amp; Jefferson College, said that voters on reflection might give little weight to the debate when choosing a candidate.</p><p>MAGA Inc., a super PAC associated with former President Donald Trump, started airing a new television ad Wednesday in the Pennsylvania race that highlights Mr. Fetterman's speech issues as it suggests that the Democrat \"just isn't right.\"</p><p>The ad uses a campaign trail comment made by Mr. Fetterman in September where he appeared to misspeak when trying to compare two different National Football League teams. \"The Eagles are so much better than the Eagles!\" the candidate told a Philadelphia crowd.</p><p>Mr. Ceisler was particularly distressed by what he described as Mr. Fetterman's \"rough\" opening and closing statements -- parts of the debate that traditionally are well-practiced. \"If I would have been back in my old days coaching debate prep, it would have been all about the open and the close,\" Mr. Ceisler said.</p><p>Still, like many Democrats, Mr. Ceisler said it was unclear to him whether the debate would prove meaningful to voters. Some Democrats noted that more than 550,000 people have already cast early ballots, and argued that few voters are up for grabs at this point.</p><p>Some supporters said Mr. Fetterman should have taken a pass on the debate. Ted Strickland, a former Democratic governor of Ohio, said his initial reaction was that he wasn't sure Mr. Fetterman \"should have done this,\" but after watching the full event and discussing it with his wife, he landed on another opinion.</p><p>\"He showed courage and a willingness to put himself out there and I think that should mean something to people,\" Mr. Strickland said.</p><p>Emilia Rowland, a Fetterman campaign spokeswoman, made a similar case. \"Political Twitter is one thing,\" she said, \"but real people who watched the debate last night -- their takeaway is here's a guy who was in the hospital months ago and is now on the debate stage talking about the issues, and his positions and his values are crystal clear.\"</p>",
