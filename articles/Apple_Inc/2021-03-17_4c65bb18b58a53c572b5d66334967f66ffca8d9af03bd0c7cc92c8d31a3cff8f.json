  "text": "<p>In his last film, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ded6d7e0-18cf-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21\"><em>Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened</em></a>, documentary-maker Chris Smith told the story of the Fyre festival, an outlandish scam that saw ticket-holders pay thousands of dollars to end up stranded and hungry on a wind-torn Bahamian island. The same fascination with high deception now inspires <em>Operation Varsity Blues</em>, a flawed but watchable precis of the 2019 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e89db1bc-4652-11e9-a965-23d669740bfb\">US college admissions scandal </a>which led to dozens of parents facing jail time, among them successful business figures and Hollywood actress Felicity Huffman. </p> <p>Smith takes a creative gamble early. Like the case mounted by the FBI, much of his film comes straight from the wiretapped phone of Rick Singer, mastermind of the scheme to offer fraudulent “side door” entry to the US's most prestigious colleges. But talking heads and transcripts are not enough, and Smith punctuates them with dramatised re-enactments, Singer played by actor Matthew Modine. The fit is odd, but you get used to it. </p> <p>Even so, Singer remains an enigma, a cold fish who simply steps conscience-free from inflating his own résumé to doing the same for students transformed with Photoshop and bribery into star athletes and academic prodigies. </p> <p>What the film does well is refusing to paint him as a lone bad apple. Smith doesn't flinch from a grim conclusion — that for a large number of wealthy parents, Singer only extended the logic that had always defined their children's education. You buy one advantage and then you buy the next. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Netflix now</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Operation Varsity Blues tells the story of the US college admissions scandal' FT.com 17 March.
