  "text": "<p>Although the date was a little off, it was a prescient call. Last month, Sony Group Corp. Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida, a former aide to Mr. Idei, held a strategy briefing and pointed to a milestone that vindicated his old boss: In the year ended March 2022, Sony's three entertainment businesses—videogames, music and video content such as movies—accounted for more than half the company's revenue for the first time, Mr. Yoshida said.</p><p>These entertainment businesses accounted for two-thirds of operating income, which reached nearly $10 billion and helped Sony recover its spot as Japan's second most valuable company by market capitalization after Toyota Motor Corp.</p><p>Mr. Idei was also a pioneer in corporate governance, reshaping Sony to resemble American companies with a board populated by outside directors. The terminology he introduced to distinguish executives running the company from directors charged with oversight—a distinction previously little observed in Japan—became part of the standard Japanese corporate lexicon, copied so often people soon forgot who invented it.</p><p>Yet for all his vision, Mr. Idei fell short in tackling the biggest threat to Sony's dominance of tech hardware: Apple Inc.</p><p>Sony had invented the Walkman, and new technologies to deliver music should have been its bread and butter.</p><p>Instead, Apple was the pioneer with its iPod, and the key was combining hardware and software. The compact music player with an elegant user interface offered easy-to-download music tracks from many publishers. Sony's effort to compete was hobbled by internal debate and software development problems.</p><p>It was the prelude to an even worse defeat. Sony engineers were expert at miniaturization, yet it was Apple that packed features into what amounted to a hand-held computer and multimedia player—the iPhone, introduced in 2007. Although Sony sells the Xperia smartphone today, it has never been more than a bit player in the defining product of the mobile age.</p><p>Mr. Idei defended his tenure, saying he fought to overhaul Sony. In a 2013 documentary on Japan's NHK public television, he was asked whether he was the person who ruined Sony. \"I'd be honored if you thought that way. Because it shows how much leadership I exerted, don't you think?\" He added that many Japanese companies that stuck to manufacturing hardware had been swallowed up or gone out of business.</p><p>Born on Nov. 22, 1937, in Tokyo, the son of an economics professor at Waseda University, Mr. Idei joined Sony out of Waseda in 1960. He was an elementary school classmate of a daughter of Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka and recalled in a book published this year that when he went for a job interview, he was surprised to be greeted by a personnel manager, not Mr. Ibuka.</p><p>\"I want to meet someone more important,\" Mr. Idei recalled telling the manager, whereupon he was brought to the co-founders, Mr. Ibuka and Akio Morita, who worked at side-by-side desks. He told Mr. Morita he wanted to help Sony expand overseas and work in Europe, and Mr. Morita told him to come back the next day to start training. Years later, he moved to Europe to manage Sony businesses there.</p><p>After rising through the ranks as a marketing specialist, Mr. Idei was a surprise pick to run Sony in 1995. Two years earlier, he had witnessed then-Vice President Al Gore's speech about the information superhighway in person, and he said it reminded him of the asteroid that landed in the Yucatán Peninsula and wiped out most of the dinosaurs.</p><p>\"I thought we had to change from 'Sony the manufacturer' to 'Sony, the company with intangible assets,' \" Mr. Idei said in his book this year. \"You could say that the 10-year period I was president was a battle to do this.\"</p><p>Mr. Idei is survived by his wife and their daughter.</p><p>Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Peter Landers at peter.landers@wsj.com</p><p>Sony Chief Nobuyuki Idei Foresaw a Shift to Games, Music and Films</p>",
