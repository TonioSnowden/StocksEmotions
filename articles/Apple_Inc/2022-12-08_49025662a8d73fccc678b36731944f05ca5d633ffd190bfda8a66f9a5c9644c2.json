  "title": "Heard on the Street:  TSMC's U.S. Chip Gambit Has Powerful Backers  ----  By Jacky Wong",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  \"American manufacturing is back,\" President Biden said Tuesday as he visited the new Arizona site of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That sentiment may yet prove premature -- but the Taiwanese chip maker's latest commitment to building on American soil is still something to celebrate. </p><p>\n  One key takeaway from Tuesday's event: TSMC's major U.S. customers appear to be telegraphing their support for more advanced chips to be made on American soil. That raises the probability of a larger presence for firms like TSMC and Samsung in the future. </p><p>\n  TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker, said Tuesday it will build a second semiconductor factory in Arizona, bringing its total planned investment there to $40 billion. The first plant, announced in 2020 under a $12 billion investment plan, is expected to start mass production in 2024. The second factory will make chips with 3-nanometer technology, currently the fastest available. TSMC will upgrade the first plant, originally slated to make 5-nanometer chips, to make 4-nanometer ones. The aggregate 600,000 wafer-a-year capacity of both Arizona factories will add up to double TSMC's original planned capacity in the state. </p><p>\n  The company's commitment to more than triple its new factory investment in the U.S. is a win for the Chips Act championed by Mr. Biden, which provides subsidies for chip companies to build fabrication plants in the country. </p><p>\n  But in terms of insulating the U.S. from its heavy dependence on Taiwan and South Korea for chips, there is a long way to go. While 3-nanometer chips are currently the most advanced, they will probably be a generation or two behind the fastest chips by the time the plant starts production in 2026. And the Arizona plants will account for only a single-digit percentage of TSMC's manufacturing capacity. Bernstein estimates the plants will account for about 3% of TSMC's global capacity in 2026; Morgan Stanley puts the figure at 8%. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, Bernstein expects the Arizona factories to contribute a high-single-digit percentage of TSMC's 2026 revenue. In comparison, Apple accounted for 26% of TSMC's sales last year, according to Bernstein. The $40 billion U.S. investment, spread over several years, is just a bit higher than TSMC's total 2022 capital expenditure, which it estimates at $36 billion. </p><p>\n  Nonetheless one very encouraging sign is that TSMC's key customers are sending a strong signal of support for made-in-America chips. Chief executives from Apple, AMD and Nvidia all visited the TSMC facilities Tuesday. Those companies are big TSMC customers and will likely be significant buyers of chips from its Arizona plants. Escalating geopolitical tension between China and the U.S. means they have a strong interest in making sure some of the advanced chips they need are produced close to home -- rather than exclusively across the Taiwan Strait from the People's Liberation Army. </p><p>\n  Asia will remain the locus of global semiconductor manufacturing for many years. But the U.S. is starting to rebuild its capacity at the margins. For Uncle Sam and tech titans like Apple and Nvidia, that is likely to be a relief. </p><p></p>",
