  "text": "<p>Democrats put up an unexpectedly strong fight in the US midterm elections that will decide which party controls Congress and were seen as a referendum on Joe Biden's presidency.</p> <p>The early tallies showed many battleground races across the country <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcb79319-dfb9-4f1b-b321-dd9cc8f79a68\">were too close to call</a>, with control of the Senate remaining in the balance and Republicans struggling to secure widespread victories in swing districts in the House of Representatives.</p> <p>“It's not a wave for sure,” said Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, referring to the “red wave” that many pollsters had predicted heading into election day. </p> <p>Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, told the Financial Times: “This is not a tsunami . . . I think that Republicans got ahead of themselves.”</p> <p>The best early result for Republicans was in Florida, where Ron DeSantis, the 44-year-old governor, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a75677ee-1e24-4bb8-8905-d1d5ddcbad9a\">stormed to victory</a> over his Democrat rival Charlie Crist. With 96 per cent of precincts reporting, DeSantis led by 20 points, a significant improvement on the three-point margin Donald Trump beat Joe Biden by in the state just two years ago.</p> <p>The size of the DeSantis victory overshadowed Donald Trump's comeback campaign. The former president this week made his clearest hint yet that he will seek re-election in 2024 and appeared to threaten DeSantis hours before his victory was confirmed, saying he could “hurt himself very badly” if he entered the presidential race.</p> <p>There was better news for Democrats in the closely watched Pennsylvania Senate seat vacated by Pat Toomey. John Fetterman, who suffered a stroke earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/773fdc1d-c63b-48b5-82f9-319f5afa9897#post-63e611c5-3c91-4145-96ca-c1ff3b4ea0d8\">secured victory</a> over the Trump-backed television personality Mehmet Oz.</p> <p>The battle for control of the US Senate has come down <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/773fdc1d-c63b-48b5-82f9-319f5afa9897#post-b509e080-616b-4f20-b79c-8e8a83860657\">to a handful of swing states</a>. In Georgia, incumbent Democrat Senator Raphael Warnock was fewer than 2,000 votes ahead of his Trump-endorsed challenger Herschel Walker. Should neither win 50 per cent of votes cast, the seat will go to a run-off on December 6.</p> <p>Other closely run senate races include Arizona, where incumbent Mark Kelly is leading Republican challenger Blake Masters, while in Wisconsin, the GOP's Ron Johnson appears to have held off Democrat Mandela Barnes to keep the seat in Republican hands.</p> <p>Republicans, however, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/773fdc1d-c63b-48b5-82f9-319f5afa9897#post-bab3819e-0228-4f2c-a4a5-5b20d99b8f73\">were on course to win the House</a> despite a strong performance from the Democrats on the east coast where their candidates were seen as vulnerable, with victories for Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Seth Magaziner in Rhode Island.</p> <p>Kevin McCarthy, who will replace Nancy Pelosi as House speaker should Republicans regain control of the House, said his majority would&#xa0;prioritise the economy, safety, freedom and the prosecution of criminals.</p> <p>In the governorship races, Georgia's Republican governor Brian Kemp defeated Democratic rival Stacey Abrams and Kathy Hochul declared victory over her Republican challenger Lee Zeldin in New York state. Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, defeated his Democratic rival Beto O'Rourke and captured his third term in the governor's mansion.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Whatever the final tally, writes Edward Luce, Biden <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e1f3a6a-e261-47f6-ba63-d1f023649a66\">has avoided the shellacking</a> that befell both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, his Democratic predecessors.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Follow the Financial Times' live midterm elections </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a2ef26f-e50b-4a4f-b103-c4fd263ea60e?source=homepage\"><em>results tracker</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/773fdc1d-c63b-48b5-82f9-319f5afa9897\"><em>live blog</em></a><em> for the latest.</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. FTX on brink of collapse </strong>The crypto industry has been shaken by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8db7e24b-5a15-4856-b81e-a2027157aaad\">near collapse of one of the largest crypto exchanges</a>. FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, clinched a rescue deal with arch-rival Binance after a surge in customer withdrawals sparked a liquidity crisis. <em>For the latest crypto ructions, premium subscribers can </em><a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=62c5b64e2e5c504788777adf\"><em>sign up to our Cryptofinance newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper: </strong>FTX was considered one of the better-managed players in an industry that regulators have called a “wild west”. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/dcea81b9-70c3-486d-9622-b9cdd84da3fc\">What happened</a>?</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. TikTok slashes global revenue targets by at least $2bn </strong>The Chinese-owned platform has <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/c4ce8f13-bec0-4cde-a885-7857f0bbb733\">cut its worldwide revenue targets for 2022</a> as it struggles to meet ambitious goals, becoming the latest tech giant to be hit by a global online spending slump. The decision comes as its US operations <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e70316fa-bae2-4b3a-989f-d761e078b7a0\">undergo a big restructuring</a> in response to a slowing economy and depressed digital advertising spend.</p> <p><strong>3. Disney's streaming spending weighs on profits</strong> Walt Disney's streaming business added a robust 14.6mn subscribers in the fourth quarter but the growth <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c82e33b-6b33-45ea-8bfd-9387dedb8736\">came at a high cost</a>, as substantial losses weighed on the company's profits. The streaming service's operating losses rose by $800mn to $1.5bn largely because of rocketing content spending and marketing expenses.</p> <p><strong>4. Musk sells almost $4bn of Tesla shares after Twitter deal closes</strong> The new billionaire owner of Twitter yesterday disclosed he had dumped <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21b1259e-4e6b-4e52-bdd5-cebb89f111c0\">another $3.95bn worth of his Tesla shares</a>, taking his total sales to nearly $20bn since he launched his $44bn takeover bid for Twitter this year. The purpose of the latest sales, which took place between Friday and Tuesday, according to a regulatory filing, was not disclosed.</p> <p><strong>5. Taiwan rallies drone makers to prepare military for China threat </strong>Taiwan is attempting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec221278-127e-40d4-859e-9f2408bf3f7e\">to build a domestic supply chain</a> within a year for drones that its military could use in a war with China. The strategy is part of President Tsai Ing-wen's effort to make the armed forces focus on an increasingly pressing threat from Beijing. </p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Meta job cuts</strong> The company formerly known as Facebook <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/348068b1-24d9-434b-9ae7-6599027bf84f\">will begin mass job cuts today</a>, in a drastic cost-cutting cull as the social media company grapples with falling revenues and rising competition. Employees at Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, will be notified of their employment status via email from 6am Eastern Time, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p><strong>Corporate earnings </strong>Wall Street expects Rivian Automotive‘s third-quarter revenue to rise as it delivers more of its R1T pick-up trucks and R1S sports-utility vehicles. Investors expect updates on how the company plans to ramp up production and how it looks to tackle soaring costs.</p> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> Wholesale inventories are likely to have risen by 0.8 per cent in September — the same rate at which they increased in August, commerce department data is expected to show. A report from the Mortgage Bankers' Association on mortgage applications is also due for release.</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John Williams will give keynote remarks before <a href=\"https://www.snb.ch/en/ifor/research/conf/other_academic_conferences/id/sem_2022_03_08\">the SNB-FRB-BIS High-Level Conference on Global Risk, Uncertainty and Volatility</a> organised by the Swiss National Bank, Federal Reserve Board and the Bank for International Settlements in Zurich, Switzerland. Separately, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond president Thomas Barkin will speak on the economic outlook before the <a href=\"https://business.regionalchamber.biz/events/details/top-of-virginia-economic-summit-november-9-2022-17144\">Top of Virginia Economic Summit 2022</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>COP27 </strong>Finance ministers meet at the UN climate summit in Egypt to reflect their commitment to action on the environment. US climate envoy John Kerry is also expected to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf064250-e4ce-48c2-a4dd-dc96bc7660e2\">announce his proposal</a> for a power-sector credits system.</p> <ul>  <li><p>One year after COP26 in Glasgow, where former Bank of England governor Mark Carney pledged that $130tn — four in every 10 dollars under management globally — would be deployed to limit global warming, his alliance risks falling short of expectations and promises. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/8d0c1064-881e-42b4-9075-18e646f3e1ad\">Here's why</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Delay only makes climate action more urgent </strong>We have a global challenge that can only be solved with huge investments, notably in new energy systems. But our capital markets are fragmented by country risk, writes Martin Wolf. The only solution is for rich countries <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5198e3ba-997f-4db5-8310-3a68ae91d9f2\">to underwrite a substantial part of that risk.</a></p> <p><strong>Apple's bargain with Beijing </strong>Apple's record profits in greater China are the result of corporate diplomacy led by chief executive Tim Cook — allowing the Silicon Valley company to sail through President Xi Jinping's crackdown. But critics argue Apple's reliance on Chinese manufacturing has made it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31ab6e36-e683-490a-bf94-b83e031f3169\">acquiesce too readily to authoritarian demands</a>.</p> <p><strong>Russia becomes India's top oil supplier</strong> Russia has surpassed Iraq and Saudi Arabia as India's largest supplier of oil, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f01161be-189f-4f69-918f-fd2a1f0fa1e3\">according to independent research companies</a>. India's imports of Russian oil have soared since President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Plus:</strong> Putin's nuclear threats may hint <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6ecbf62-f26d-401f-936b-e5bd85f25c06\">at an electromagnetic pulse strike</a>, writes Roger Pardo-Maurer, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence.</p></li> </ul> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11741581.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>Evelyn de Rothschild dies aged 91</strong> The British banker, who advised the late Queen Elizabeth II on financial matters, has died “after a short illness”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1292bd27-c9ae-4b7f-a186-4913ef1eda73\">the family said yesterday</a>.
