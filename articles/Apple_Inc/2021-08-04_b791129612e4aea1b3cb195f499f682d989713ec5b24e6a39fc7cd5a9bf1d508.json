  "text": "<p>Short-term chip shortages and long-term electric prospects have dominated the quarterly earnings of the leading carmakers. <strong>General Motors</strong>, Toyota and Honda were the latest to report on Wednesday, with strong June quarters but their outlooks looking more uncertain.</p> <p>GM shares are down 9 per cent despite the Detroit company posting a record adjusted profit of $4.1bn, as it benefited like <strong>Ford</strong> from surging demand for pick-up trucks and SUVs. However, chief executive Mary Barra said GM would “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-profit-posts-profit-raises-full-year-outlook-2021-08-04/\">continue to see the impact</a> this year” of the chip shortage, and expects it will continue into the new year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4e9745f-24c9-4ddc-bae1-45e4a4a58022\">Claire Bushey in Chicago reports</a> investors are urging on GM and Ford's electric plans. In June, GM again increased its&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3aa7a6ee-8a18-4cdd-b031-742a237f830c\">planned spending</a>&#xa0;on electric and autonomous vehicles, to $35bn by 2025, while Ford has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be1730fc-33da-479d-8a5b-d5a0bdc83d57\">committed $30bn</a>&#xa0;over the same period.</p> <p>“The Street wants to see an accelerated EV vision,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “It's an arms race right now . . . There's a fear that if they're not aggressive enough over the coming years, they'll be left in the dust by the likes of <strong>Tesla.</strong>”</p> <p>Tesla's Model 3 has already overtaken the <strong>Nissan</strong> Leaf as the best-selling electric vehicle of all time. But the head of the Japanese electric vehicle pioneer has told us his<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc30813d-a3c2-4350-8b8e-21a88eba9c14\"> company retains a head start </a>in one crucial area: giving a second life to car batteries that are past their prime.&#xa0;</p> <p>Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive, said the group wanted to expand its knowhow in collecting lithium-ion batteries from old Leaves worldwide. The batteries are reused to store renewable energy at 7-Eleven convenience stores and to power railroad crossings and delivery robots in factories.</p> <p><strong>Toyota</strong> also reported a record quarterly profit, as sales in North America more than tripled. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/666210a5-b107-4daa-8c95-8a734c345339\">Lex says</a> one reason is Toyota could dip into its stockpile of semiconductor chips. It could rely on local chip producer Renesas for stable supplies while its global peers competed for limited output from Samsung and TSMC. On Tuesday, <strong>BMW</strong> and <strong>Stellantis</strong> both <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/bmw-and-stellantis-report-big-jumps-in-profit-as-car-sales-snap-back.html\">reported big profit increases,</a> but warned the semiconductor shortage would continue to disrupt production.</p> <p>The embattled US electric truck start-up <strong>Nikola</strong> is in a worse position. On Tuesday, it reported chip shortages could mean it<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e5134b0-6411-4fa4-9622-95a98df74515\"> would not have saleable vehicles</a> until next year. Investors had hoped for better news, following the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7469bb92-10c7-49a5-8646-193fb3777d2f\">fraud charges</a>&#xa0;brought last week against founder Trevor Milton.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Robinhood's retail renaissance</strong><br>Robinhood, the trading app used by many retail investors to drive the furious rally in “meme stocks” earlier this year, has gained characteristics of a meme stock itself following its disappointing IPO last week. Shares of the brokerage <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9017fe2-e24a-4224-b2fa-320be47853b7\">surged as much as 82 per cent</a> on Wednesday, as its market capitalisation briefly climbed to $71bn on the back of social media support.</p> <p><strong>2. SEC chair warns on crypto</strong><br>The chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission has called on Congress to give his agency additional powers to protect investors in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-f0816ce3-9728-4a21-94e8-5522774be8a0/sIffC5cqJpoItHzyg5fuWA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRi7PFqP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvZjA4MTZjZTMtOTcyOC00YTIxLTk0ZTgtNTUyMjc3NGJlOGEwP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjEwYTY1NGJhYjJkM2MwMDA0MzVjYmYyJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0xM2I3ZTM0MS1lZDAyLTJiNTMtZThjMC1kOWNiNTliZThiM2JXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphCKxsCmEm7sXsUhRjaHJpcy5udXR0YWxsQGZ0LmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~\">“Wild West” cryptocurrency markets</a>. Gary Gensler told a conference: “This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse.” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf89a64d-32fe-48ca-85f3-5b36ce4fb6fe\">Gillian Tett has been getting her head round </a>crypto and says “&#xa0;working out whether a particular cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme or not demands a knowledge of computer science&#xa0;<em>and</em>&#xa0;finance&#xa0;<em>and</em>&#xa0;psychology or anthropology”.</p> <p><strong>3. Facebook shuts down academic probe</strong><br>A group of researchers at New York University studying Facebook's political advertising targeting practices has accused the social media company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99cc70b0-182f-418b-be95-2bc221e62fee\">of “silencing” them</a> after it severed their access to the platform. Facebook said the project was violating its terms of service.</p> <p><strong>4. UK has security concerns over Arm deal</strong><br>The future of Nvidia's planned $40bn takeover of Arm, the British chip designer, is being considered by Boris Johnson's government, with the Competition and Markets Authority saying there were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76828bc9-e64f-446e-b03a-5f34df195bfa\">worrying implications for national security, </a>meaning the deal could be blocked.</p> <p><strong>5. Activision's #MeToo crisis</strong><br>A top executive at Activision Blizzard has left in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3aa83d4-4c00-40b3-ae53-d9c9bed5a361\">management shake-up </a>that promised to bolster “integrity and inclusivity”, after America's most valuable video games company was rocked by allegations of workplace misconduct. Hundreds of Activision Blizzard workers walked out in protest last week at the company's handling of a California state lawsuit alleging sex discrimination, harassment and retaliation.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Realme's MagDart charging</h2> <p>Apple has the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0632330-25c6-4372-b955-6a7f6bad3033#:~:text=Tech%20tools,it%20provides.\">MagSafe Battery Pack </a>for wireless iPhone charging, Android now has Realme's MagDart, which seems to offer a lot more. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HdlA4yI7i0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Announced on Tuesday</a>, realme is offering “the world's fastest 50W magnetic wireless charger, realme Flash, the first Android smartphone that supports magnetic wireless charging, and several other magnetic charging accessories”. The accessories include a thinner 15W charger, a beauty light that gives extra light when taking selfies, a wallet, plus a case for the realme GT smartphone. There was no news on availability or pricing, but The Verge has<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607214/realme-magdart-announced-magnetic-wireless-charger-devices\"> this assessment.</a></p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Automakers urged to supercharge electric plans' FT.com 4 August.
