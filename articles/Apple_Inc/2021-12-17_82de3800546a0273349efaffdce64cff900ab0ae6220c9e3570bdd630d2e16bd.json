  "title": "MANSION --- Food & Wine Issue: Party of None --- The pandemic forced many residents-only restaurants to close, frustrating the homeowners who pay big bucks for the privilege of having them",
  "text": "<p>For years, private restaurants have been a sought-after amenity at high-end condominiums and gated communities. But by and large, residents-only restaurants don't make money. The pandemic has exposed the financial vulnerability of these restaurants, which are heavily subsidized by common charges and other fees paid by building owners. Still, many residents say it's a price they are willing to pay for the exclusivity, safety and convenience of an in-house eatery.</p><p>While some of New York's most exclusive prewar cooperatives have long had private dining rooms, the concept of residents-only restaurants took off at Manhattan's 15 Central Park West in the mid-2000s. In recent years, developers have tapped celebrity chefs to design exclusive menus for well-heeled owners at buildings such as 432 Park Avenue, where Michelin-starred chef Shaun Hergatt oversees the restaurant, and 220 Central Park South, where Jean-Georges Vongerichten has a restaurant for residents and their guests only. The Mandarin Oriental Residences Fifth Avenue will have a private restaurant by Daniel Boulud. When fully completed, Central Park Tower in New York will have rotating chefs at a restaurant and ballroom.</p><p>To make these arrangements work, most condo associations pay the chef or restaurateur a management fee and sometimes a percentage of top-line sales, said restaurant consultant Arlene Spiegel. Celebrity chefs can command six figures to create a menu and appear at special events, and they often get a signing bonus. How much time the chef actually spends in the kitchen depends on their arrangement with the building.</p><p>But given the limited audience, most private restaurants simply aim to break even, said Ms. Spiegel. In addition to the prices paid by diners for their meals, they rely on residents' common charges to carry the business.</p><p>When 432 Park Avenue opened in 2015, residents initially paid $1,200 a year for the restaurant. As of 2021, the fee is $15,000 a year and the hours have been reduced because of Covid, according to people familiar with the building.</p><p>At 220 Central Park South, developer Vornado Realty Trust projected $500,000 in dining expenses for its first year of operations, according to the offering plan. The Central Park Tower offering plan projected restaurant expenses of $375,000 during the first year of operations; each unit owner will be assessed $2,000 annually to reduce the restaurant's operating deficit.</p><p>At Miami's Porsche Design Tower, developer Gil Dezer said the annual budget for Fuel, the building's private restaurant, is around $1.5 million a year. That is offset by $650,000 in subsidies from the building's 130 unit owners, whose common charges include about $5,000 for the restaurant a year, or roughly $400 a month, he said.</p><p>Mr. Dezer said he originally wanted to hire a celebrity chef, but didn't in order to keep costs down. \"My take personally is not to stick the association with a bill,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Mina operated residents-only restaurants at Millennium Partners condominiums in both Boston and San Francisco before the Boston location closed. He said those private restaurants made sense because they were connected to public restaurants: Pabu Izakaya, which is temporarily closed, at the base of Millennium Tower Boston, and International Smoke in San Francisco. He had a finishing kitchen in each of the residential towers and a full production kitchen downstairs, and was able to move staff from one restaurant to the other. Residents frequented his restaurants downstairs, he said, which boosted those businesses.</p><p>One reason Mina at the Tower didn't reopen, Mr. Mina said, is that Pabu hasn't returned, and he's not sure it will. Without Pabu, he said he would have had to offer a narrower selection at Millennium Tower, so the board went with another operator.</p><p>Like all restaurants, private eateries faced added challenges during Covid. At Ballerina, the private restaurant at Oceana Bal Harbour in Miami, 2020 revenue was down 32% from what was projected, said Ernesto Cohan, the building's sales director. Ballerina never closed completely, he said, but it moved dining outside and temporarily prohibited residents from inviting guests. Mr. Cohan said the restaurant also cut back its hours, serving only breakfast and lunch for about five months. Pre-Covid, it served 800 meals a week. As of mid-December, volume was almost back to that level. He said the drop in business didn't affect the building's overall budget because other expenses fell.</p><p>Homeowners say they like the cachet and convenience of private restaurants with big-name chefs.</p><p>Mickey DeMatteis, a 65-year-old retired Apple executive, said he eats five meals a week at the private restaurants at Moonlight Basin, a community in Big Sky, Mont., where he and his wife, Lisa Merkel, 57, purchased a second home for $3.5 million in 2020. Mr. DeMatteis said Big Sky has a handful of restaurants, but in winter it can be a treacherous drive into town. \"It's not something you want to do consistently,\" he said.</p><p>Moonlight Basin homeowners are required to pay a $125,000 initiation fee to join the club that operates the private restaurants, plus $9,000 in annual dues. Meals at the restaurants aren't included.</p><p>During Covid, Mr. Dezer said Fuel's popularity shot up as delivery orders \"went through the roof,\" and it did approximately $1.2 million in sales in 2020. \"That was actually one of our better years, because everyone was trapped at home,\" he said, but the restaurant still lost around $300,000 for the year.</p><p>For many residents, the security of a private restaurant has grown more attractive during the pandemic. \"There are still a lot of people who don't feel comfortable going to restaurants,\" said Lauren Witkoff, 62, an executive at the development firm founded by her husband, Steven Witkoff. Last year, she bought a $5.8 million condo at the Ritz-Carlton Residences in Miami Beach, which has a private restaurant. \"It's nice not to have to deal with traffic and crowds,\" she said.</p><p>The restaurant in the newly finished building, developed by Lionheart Capital, was initially set to open during Covid, according to Philip Freedman, the building's director of sales. The pandemic delayed the opening until May 2021. Mr. Freedman said residents pay as they go at the restaurant, which has no minimum annual fees.</p><p>At Millennium Tower Boston, board member Howard Goldman, 62, said he knows residents are eager to bring the restaurant back online; it's the question he's asked most often by neighbors. \"People aren't happy about it, but we have a pretty valid reason, which is Covid,\" he said. \"We didn't want to take on that risk.\"</p><p>Mr. Goldman said condo fees that would have been used to support the restaurant instead went to other improvements, like adding Peloton bikes in the gym and improving a golf simulator room. The board was also able to add to its reserve fund, he said. The restaurant is set to open with a new operator in the coming weeks, he said.</p><p>He, too, is eager for the restaurant to reopen; he ate there three times a week before Covid. \"It's just so convenient.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
