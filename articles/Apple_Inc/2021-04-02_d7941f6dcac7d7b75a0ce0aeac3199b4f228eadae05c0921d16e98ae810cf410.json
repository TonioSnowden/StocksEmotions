  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Many on Wall Street turn to the \"boredom market hypothesis\" to explain the stunning rally of the past year: Bereft of travel and other pursuits, stimulus-check recipients gambled on hot stocks ranging from GameStop to electric-vehicle startups. As economies reopen, investors will need to grapple with the consequences of more people spending their checks outdoors. </p><p>\n  It has been two weeks since the Treasury Department started sending $240 billion worth of electronic payments to households. Spending on Chase credit cards jumped and is 1.6% below its pre-Covid trend -- compared with a 40% fall in March 2020 -- JPMorgan Chase data showed this week. </p><p>\n  This time, though, the stimulus isn't filtering through to the stock market. </p><p>\n  Daily equity purchases by individual investors have remained stable at around $11 billion in recent weeks on a 10-day rolling basis, data from flow tracker VandaTrack shows. This is sharply different from what happened in April 2020, when checks immediately led to a jump in retail flows, or January of this year, when the impact was clearly noticeable two weeks in. </p><p>\n  Both amateur and professional money managers need to pay close attention. In a paper published this week, researchers from the Swiss Finance Institute found that individual investors had a disproportionate market sway versus institutional ones during the second quarter of 2020 because they reacted more to price changes: Every dollar going into zero-fee investing application Robinhood caused a $5 increase in equity capitalization. </p><p>\n  Households usually make decisions about spending first and then decide how to invest their savings, rather than making a choice between going to the cinema or buying GameStop shares. But forcing people to stay indoors turned gambling on hot stocks into a new form of entertainment. Behavioral-economics research also shows that people tend to spend one-off windfalls more recklessly. </p><p>\n  Now, thanks to vaccinations and lockdowns easing, there are more ways to spend money recklessly away from home. Chase figures suggest that the largest increases in card payments were registered in lodging establishments, restaurants and retail stores. </p><p>\n  Also, previous rounds of stimulus hit people's bank accounts at a time when the stocks favored by individual investors were doing well. This time it happened right after a big drawdown in their portfolios, VandaTrack estimates. Playing Wall Street trader is far less fun when you are losing. </p><p>\n  The absence of this tidal force should have consequences for how markets trade, at least in the short term. </p><p>\n  For one, much of the 2020 enthusiasm for \"reopening\" trades was driven by individual investors. Without them, sectors such as airlines, hotels and cruise ships offer less of an upside even if the summer season meets now-elevated market expectations. </p><p>\n  Retail money also favored electric-vehicle, space and cannabis stocks, which have all stalled lately. </p><p>\n  The impact on the wider tech sector is less clear-cut. Retail money is very exposed to it, yet flows into tech-centered passive vehicles are still increasing. That suggests many see them as a prudent place to put long-term savings. Staples like Apple and Alphabet may be in a better position than smaller startups. </p><p>\n  The no-fee app trading boom wasn't purely a pandemic phenomenon. Funds seem to keep flowing into online-forum darlings like GameStop, suggesting that a few organized enthusiasts are still eager to prop up individual firms. On the whole, though, the role of boredom in asset-pricing models should greatly diminish as Americans shift a chunk of their lives offline. </p><p></p>",
