  "title": "U.S. News: Alex Jones Is Ordered to Pay $45.2 Million",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Jones and others at Infowars regularly said on-air that the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn., which killed 20 first-graders and six adults, was staged by actors as part of a wide plot to promote gun control, among other left-leaning aims. The Sandy Hook parents testified that they received death threats following Mr. Jones's broadcasts; one such phone message was played aloud for the jury during the trial.</p><p>This week, Mr. Jones said under oath that he now believes the shooting was \"100% real,\" but also cast himself as a victim in his own right, saying that the attention paid to his rampant speculation on the incident had harmed his business.</p><p>After the verdict was read, lawyers for Mr. Jones said they would appeal. They also said they would ask the court to reduce the sum under a Texas law capping punitive damages.</p><p>The judge in the case, Maya Guerra Gamble, said she would entertain a motion to impose additional punishment against Mr. Jones and his lawyer for their courtroom conduct throughout the trial. Mr. Jones had to be frequently reminded by the judge to tell the truth while under oath.</p><p>The judge also said she would not oppose efforts by law enforcement and the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to obtain text messages and other communications from Mr. Jones's phone that were turned over to the plaintiffs' lawyers as part of the trial, saying that she didn't think she could stand between the information and Congress.</p><p>The total sum of penalties meted on Mr. Jones was far lower than the damages sought earlier by the Sandy Hook parents. The parents had sought $150 million in actual damages and nearly the same amount in punitive damages.</p><p>But the Austin judgment is just the tip of Mr. Jones's financial and legal woes. He faces two similar damages trials in coming months from other parents of Sandy Hook victims. In those cases, as in the Austin proceedings, Mr. Jones was found liable by default for defamation after, in an unusual move, he declined to mount any defense.</p><p>An economist who testified Friday for the plaintiffs estimated Mr. Jones's and Infowars' parent company's combined net worth at between $135 million and $270 million. Mr. Jones's personal net worth is between $70 million and $140 million, the economist testified, a figure factoring in money that he has paid himself from Infowars' parent company. In testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Jones said the company's revenue was approximately $70 million last year.</p><p>Infowars' parent, Free Speech Systems LLC, filed for bankruptcy protection last week -- the second time the platform has attempted to enter chapter 11 in recent months. Lawyers for Sandy Hook families have accused Mr. Jones of diverting money to protect the business from potential judgments, an accusation Mr. Jones's lawyer denies.</p><p>Still, Mr. Jones's company has in recent years survived threats of expulsion from the mainstream.</p><p>Major tech platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Apple and Spotify kicked his show off their services in 2018. But his business remained resilient despite the deplatforming, documents and testimony have revealed, thanks largely to its heavy reliance on the sale of nutritional supplements like Infowars Life Super Male Vitality.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Jones didn't respond to requests to comment.</p><p>The damages award capped off a lurid week-and-a-half trial in which Mr. Jones and his lawyer sparred with the plaintiffs and were repeatedly admonished by the judge for breaking the rules of the court.</p><p>On Wednesday, during the final moments of Mr. Jones's cross examination, the plaintiff's lawyer said that Mr. Jones's legal team had accidentally shared cellphone records that the noted conspiracy theorist had sworn under oath didn't exist, raising the specter of perjury.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
