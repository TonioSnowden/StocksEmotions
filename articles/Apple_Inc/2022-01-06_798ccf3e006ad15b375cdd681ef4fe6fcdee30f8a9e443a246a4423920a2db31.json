  "text": "<p>Good morning. The minutes of last month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting dropped at 2pm yesterday afternoon, and they turned an uneven market, in the midst of a bumpy growth-to-value shift, into an ugly mess. The minutes seem to have been more hawkish than expected. They didn't seem that way to Ethan and myself. This bit, though, seems to have particularly surprised people, by putting a vague timeframe around quantitative tightening:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate</p> </blockquote> <p>How much quantitative tightening will matter to the market and the economy is debated, but whatever your view on this, this wording (and the use of phrases such as “measured approach” in the following sentences) is consistent with our view that the Fed has pivoted tactically, but not strategically. This Fed will move, but move slowly, unless the inflation gets worse.</p> <p>In any case, perception of the Fed as more hawkish only adds fuel to the growth-to-value move — but the increasingly relaxed consensus view of the long-term trajectory of the pandemic is the real driver. More on this below. Email us: <a href=\"mailto:robert.armstrong@ft.com\">robert.armstrong@ft.com</a> and <a href=\"mailto:ethan.wu@ft.com\">ethan.wu@ft.com</a>.</p> <h1>The reflation trade is the Omicron trade</h1> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fc62da9-da68-4d1f-a2aa-c8a575d11920\">reflation trade</a> — bets on faster growth and higher interest rates — is back. Maybe this time it'll stick around.</p> <p>The narrative was muddied somewhat by broad selling after the Fed minutes hit yesterday, but it remains intact. Since Monday's close, the tech-focused Nasdaq has lost 4.6 per cent, against 2 per cent for the S&amp;P 500. Notably, the selling pressures hardly bothered the Nasdaq banks index, which is up 2.3 per cent from Monday (banks benefit from both higher growth and higher short-term rates).</p> <p>The ratio of the Russell value and growth indices has ticked up sharply in recent days:</p> <p>There is logic here. As rates rise, we expect investors to favour stocks with current cash flows over those offering future ones — the discount rate is going up. If stock markets work like they are supposed to, any half-decent recovery should have this effect.</p> <p>One way this shift plays out is as a wave of normalcy sweeping over markets that had become demented. Meme stocks and crypto got thrashed on Wednesday. James Solloway, chief market strategist at SEI Investments, reminded us that in the last decade normalcy has not been, er, normal:</p> <blockquote>  <p>We do think a rotation from the most expensive areas of the market, particularly in the technology sector, is long overdue. We've had growth beating value, really since 2010 or so, soon after the stock market started to recover from the global financial crisis. </p>  <p>We had a hint that there was a rotation under way [in late 2020 as studies rolled out showing high vaccine efficacy], but that started to peter out after the Delta variant started to take hold. And investors basically went back for the most part to the tried and true. </p> </blockquote> <p>The weak recovery from the last crisis, in other words, caused a dash for growth in a market that was short on it. Now a false dawn in late 2020 and early 2021 might just be giving way to a bona fide recovery, based on emerging evidence that Omicron's threat to the economy is less severe than Delta's, and the increasingly popular view that this latest variant may give way to a world where the virus is, hopefully, little more than a persistent nuisance.</p> <p>Reacting to the tech sell-off, Qie Zhang, a fund manager at Abrdn who specialises in tech and media, argued that investors need to distinguish between FAANG and profitless tech. Where the long tail of tech consists of far-flung growth bets, the FAANG stocks (and a few others like them) are companies that generate huge cash flows here and now. These may take a small hit, but are less likely to trail the market badly.</p> <p>All this depends on the medical facts of Omicron, however. If it proves worse than we expect, we could fall right back into the old pattern. A more deadly Omega variant or some other unforeseen medical relapse cannot be ruled out. The reflation trade is, more accurately, the Omicron trade. (<em>Ethan Wu</em>)</p> <h1>Private markets' procyclicality</h1> <p>Private capital's liquidity premium — how big it is, whether it even exists — is important.</p> <p>Many investors believe we are in a low-return world which will make their return targets hard to hit (they are probably right). They are allocating more to private markets to solve this problem. They are hoping that in return for tying up their money for many years, they will reap a liquidity premium, or that they have picked a really clever private capital manager who will outperform, or that private capital investment's optically stable returns (they are not marked to market) will flatter their reported risk-adjusted performance. Most of them are probably hoping for a combination of all three.</p> <p>The liquidity premium is closely linked to the simple notion that private capital managers — private equity and private debt funds — are long-term players. They take advantage of the cyclical fluctuations of the market, rather than cowering before them, and they buy high and sell low. When times are tough, we are told, private capital funds put their dry powder to work and, perhaps more importantly, can support their portfolio companies, allowing them to invest through the cycle and avoid debt defaults. </p> <p>There may well be some truth in this. But the latest Bank for International Settlements quarterly <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112.pdf\">review</a> contains a report undercutting one particular aspect of this story. Sirio Aramonte and Fernando Avalos argue that risk-taking in private markets is just as procyclical as in public markets: </p> <blockquote>  <p>While private markets feature final investors with long horizons, they appear every bit as procyclical as public markets. Capital deployment in [private markets] is positively correlated with stock market returns, ie more transactions are completed in bullish times . . .</p>  <p>. . . the sensitivity of private market investment to stock market returns is almost identical to those of leveraged loans and equity public offerings</p> </blockquote> <p>Part of the explanation of this is very simple. In bullish times, discount rates are lower, driving the present value of future profits up. This is almost tautological. But there are some specific reasons for private market procyclicality: </p> <blockquote>  <p>. . . some of these transactions require bridge financing or high-yield bond issuance, which are themselves procyclical . . . More generally, leverage can contribute to procyclicality. Fund managers can support more debt when their net asset value rises, thus expanding their balance sheets.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here are scatter charts showing the relationship between the volume of various types of private market transactions and stock market returns:</p> <p>The relationships are very similar to those between leveraged loan and IPO volumes and stock returns. Those two markets are understood to be wildly procyclical:</p> <p>Private market fund managers buy when markets are high.</p> <p>(Hat tip to <a href=\"https://policytensor.substack.com/\">Policy Tensor</a> for pointing out the BIS report in a tweet).</p> <p><strong>One good read</strong></p> <p>On Adam Tooze's fine Chartbook blog, a nice <a href=\"https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/top-links-65-inflation-and-price\">cool</a> analysis of the heated debate about price controls as a response to inflation.</p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong and Ethan Wu 2022 'The reflation trade is the Omicron trade' FT.com 6 January.
