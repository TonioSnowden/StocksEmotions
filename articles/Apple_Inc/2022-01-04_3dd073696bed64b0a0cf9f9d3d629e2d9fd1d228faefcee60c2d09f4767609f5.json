  "title": "Andrew Cuomo Won't Face Albany Sexual-Harassment Charge; Criminal charge represented the most pressing legal concern for the former New York governor",
  "text": "<p>A lawyer for Mr. Cuomo didn't return requests for comment. He has denied the charge and his lawyer said Mr. Apple's timing was politically motivated. The former governor was scheduled to be arraignedFriday in Albany City Court.</p><p>Mr. Soares, a Democrat, said that his office found Ms. Commisso cooperative and credible, but it was dropping the charge because \"after review of all the available evidence we have concluded that we cannot meet our burden at trial.\"</p><p>\"I, like most New Yorkers, remain deeply troubled by allegations like the ones at issue here,\" Mr. Soares said. \"Although avenues for criminal prosecution in these cases are sometimes limited, I encourage victims of workplace harassment and abuse to continue to come forward and bring these issues to light so that these important discussions can continue.\"</p><p>The criminal charge represented the most pressing legal concern for Mr. Cuomo, who is also being investigated for the potential misuse of state resources in the production of his pandemic memoir as well as the state's Covid-19 policies in nursing homes. He has denied wrongdoing on both fronts.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo resigned from office in August amid an impeachment inquiry and after an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James concluded he sexually harassed multiple women, including Ms. Commisso. Mr. Cuomo has denied touching anybody inappropriately and said Ms. James was politically motivated.</p><p>Prosecutors informed Ms. Commisso of their decision not to move forward with the case during a meeting on Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ms. Commisso didn't return messages seeking comment.</p><p>The Albany Times Union earlier reported the meeting on Monday.</p><p>Brian Premo, an attorney representing Ms. Commisso, said that she had no control over the prosecutors' decision. \"The only thing she has any power over is her resolution to continue to speak the truth and seek justice in an appropriate civil action, which she will do in due course,\" Mr. Premo said.</p><p>Mr. Apple didn't return calls seeking comment.</p><p>Ms. James's report included several descriptions of unwanted physical contact between Mr. Cuomo and several women, including Ms. Commisso and a member of his State Police protective detail. According to the report, the former governor kissed the trooper on her cheek at his Westchester County home and ran his hand along her abdomen while attending an event at the Belmont Racetrack in Nassau County.</p><p>Ms. Commisso told Ms. James's investigators that Mr. Cuomo groped her breast over her bra after she was summoned to help him use his cellphone in the Executive Mansion, which is the governor's official residence.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said the governor's actions toward the trooper were \"meant to be an acknowledgment of their presence and nothing more.\" The former governor has said he often hugged and kissed people he met at events.</p><p>Joyce Smith, the acting district attorney in Nassau County, said on Dec. 23 that her prosecutors there concluded their investigation and found the trooper's allegations \"credible, deeply troubling, but not criminal under New York law.\" The trooper told Ms. James's investigators that she felt \"completely violated\" by the incident.</p><p>Westchester County District Attorney Miriam Rocah said on Dec. 28 that it wouldn't charge Mr. Cuomo in connection with kissing the trooper or another woman who the former governor met at an event at White Plains High School. Ms. Rocah called the conduct \"concerning.\"</p><p>Mr. Apple's investigator included portions of Ms. Commisso's sworn testimony along with their complaint, as well as other records corroborating her presence at the mansion on Dec. 7. 2020. The complaint didn't attach another portion of Ms. Commisso's testimony in which she said Mr. Cuomo slammed the door of his office after groping her rather than before.</p><p>Mr. Soares's office had already pushed back Mr. Cuomo's arraignment date, saying in a Nov. 4 letter that Mr. Apple's complaint was \"potentially defective\" because it didn't include proof that Ms. Commisso's statement to Ms. James was made under oath. And \"even more troubling,\" Mr. Soares said, the sheriff's filing \"excluded other portions of her testimony where she described the very same acts described in the complaint.\"</p><p>Write to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com</p><p>Andrew Cuomo Won't Face Albany Sexual-Harassment Charge</p>",
