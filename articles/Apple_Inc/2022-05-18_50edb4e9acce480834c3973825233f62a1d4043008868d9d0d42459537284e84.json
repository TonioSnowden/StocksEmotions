  "title": "Finance News: Apple Halts Plan For 3 Days In Office",
  "text": "<p>After several delays, Apple began returning to the office at least one day a week in early April with a plan to gradually increase to three days next week.</p><p>Workers had already resumed two days a week. Some workers have left the company over its determination to be in person more.</p><p>The company's memo to workers on Tuesday didn't include a new timeline for increasing in-office time.</p><p>It was the latest twist in Apple's efforts to return to some semblance of normality more than two years after the global pandemic upended daily life.</p><p>The Cupertino, Calif., tech company was among the first companies to send workers home as the coronavirus spread and it remains one of the highest-profile examples of the challenges of striking a balance in returning.</p><p>As businesses large and small have tried to navigate a hybrid-work life, some have narrowed their ambitions of returning to two days from three days a week amid a tight labor market and workers looking for more flexibility.</p><p>Apple's delayed plans were earlier reported by Bloomberg News.</p>",
