Toomey, who is retiring from the Senate, said the trades were made by an adult son, adding that he would have suggested caution if his son had discussed them with him ahead of time.</p><p>Pool/Getty Images“These perfectly legal and non-controversial transactions were made by my adult son in his investment account that he controls exclusively,” the senator told MarketWatch in a statement. “He used only public information that was widely available at the time. The trades were made without my knowledge. I disclosed these trades in the ordinary, monthly disclosure of my, and my family's, trading activities, as required by Senate rules. Had my son asked for my advice about these trades, I would have told him the same thing I said in numerous print and television interviews: that it's a classic bubble that will end badly for most participants.”</p><p>As shown in the table below, only one other lawmaker disclosed GameStop trades.</p><p>Traders of GameStop stock in Congress in 2021</p><p> Lawmaker      Party  State  Rep. or sen.

Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are required to file disclosures within 45 days for any transactions involving stocks and other securities due to 2012's STOCK Act.</p><p>Apple's stock returned 35% in 2021, while Tesla gained 50% and NIO lost 35%. GameStop shares soared 688% last year, and AMC rocketed up 1,183%.</p><p>The trading action taking place in both the House and the Senate comes as some lawmakers have introduced legislation that would ban congressional buying and selling of individual stocks. Proponents of the ban say the trading of individual stocks by U.S. lawmakers can raise conflict of interest issues. Critics of such efforts say they're going too far, and that current laws already require regular disclosures and don't allow trading on inside information.</p><p>The spokesman for Newman, the Illinois Democrat who has disclosed sizeable trading activity by her husband, said the congresswoman&#xa0;“fully supports recently proposed legislation to limit and even ban members of Congress, their family members and senior congressional staff from trading stocks.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican who disclosed GameStop trades by his son, said the senator has concerns about a potential ban on congressional stock trading.</p><p>“Senator Toomey believes that forbidding elected officials from participating in the stock market will discourage qualified individuals from entering public service,” Toomey's spokeswoman told MarketWatch in a statement. “Moreover, he is not sure the American people want members of Congress deciding policy about the stock market without understanding how it works or what it is like to invest in stocks. That's like telling senators from an agricultural states that they can't own a farm if they want to serve in Congress. Would you really want a senator who has no experience in the agricultural industry drafting legislation on agriculture issues?”</p><p>The Toomey spokeswoman also said the senator “agrees that the public must have confidence its elected leaders are not using non-public information to personally profit,” and that's why he voted for the STOCK Act, which “expressly clarified” that members of Congress are barred from insider trading. In addition, she said existing Senate Ethics Committee rules prohibit senators from “knowingly introducing or aiding the passage of legislation in order to further their own financial interests.”</p><p>Now read:Congress's crypto traders: The U.S. lawmakers who buy and sell digital currencies</p><p>DataKind contributed to this report.</p><p>This report was first published on Feb. 3, 2022.</p>",
