  "text": "<p>All three indexes initially rose to start the trading day.</p><p>Stocks have largely edged up in recent days as markets look ahead to the new year, with many expecting a continued economic recovery and strong earnings from companies. Trading volumes reached the lowest level all year on Tuesday, according to a composite metric that includes the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.</p><p>Investors say as more information emerges they are becoming more comfortable with the theory that the Omicron variant may not lead to harsh restrictions on commerce and movement. State governors are implementing light-touch measures to try to avoid disruptions.</p><p>\"There's an element of positivity. The data continues to suggest that the disease itself caused by Omicron is materially less severe than the variants which have preceded it,\" said James Athey, an investment manager at Abrdn. \"That's always been the endgame for the pandemic.\"</p><p>Oil prices rose. Global benchmark Brent crude added 0.1%, trading at $78.73 a barrel.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.521% from 1.480% on Tuesday.

Investors have been keeping a close watch on the tech behemoth's trading as it edges closer to becoming the first company to close above a $3 trillion market capitalization.
