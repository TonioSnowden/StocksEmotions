  "title": "Apple, Google Face In-Depth Antitrust Probe of Mobile Market Power in U.K. British competition regulator says it plans to pursue probe into how companies might restrict competition on mobile devices",
  "text": "<p>As part of its proposal, the CMA said that Apple and Google operate an effective mobile-device duopoly that enables them to exercise what the regulator called a stranglehold over mobile ecosystems. The regulator said Tuesday that it is opening the investigation in part because the U.K. has delayed giving its competition regulator new power over digital markets similar to those recently passed in the European Union, which it said could help resolve those issues.</p><p>\"In the meantime, we are using our existing powers to tackle problems where we can,\" said Sarah Cardell, the CMA's interim chief executive. \"Many U.K. businesses and web developers tell us they feel that they are being held back by restrictions set by Apple and Google.\" Under U.K. rules, market investigations can lead to binding orders to change practices, but no fines.</p><p>\"We will continue to engage constructively with the Competition and Markets Authority to explain how our approach promotes competition and choice, while ensuring consumers' privacy and security are always protected,\" an Apple spokesman said. A Google spokesman said many of the concerns that the CMA raises with regard to Apple's mobile operating system don't apply to its Android. \"Android gives people a greater choice of apps and app stores than any other mobile platform,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>Some big tech rivals supported the investigation into Apple and Google, according to comments published Tuesday as part of the CMA's public consultation on its investigation. Microsoft Corp. said Apple's and Google's control over their mobile ecosystems could cause increasing threats to competition if nothing is done.</p><p>Meta Platforms Inc., owner of Facebook and Instagram, said it agreed with the choice to open an investigationâ€”and urged the regulator to broaden it to look into Apple's move to require iPhone apps to ask users whether they want to be tracked. That change last year has cut significantly into Meta's revenues and caused its stock to stumble.</p><p>Several app developers also submitted comments in support of the investigation but withheld their names from the comments the CMA published on Tuesday. One, which identified itself as a social-gaming company, said the ability of users to play whenever they are online is \"hampered by the policies of the main gatekeepers to protect their own market power and revenue.\"</p><p>Apple, Google Face In-Depth Antitrust Probe of Mobile Market Power in U.K.</p>",
