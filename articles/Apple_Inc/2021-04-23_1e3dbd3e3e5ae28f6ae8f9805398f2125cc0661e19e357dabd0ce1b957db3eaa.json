  "title": "U.S. News: Prosecutors Get a Path to More Police Cases",
  "text": "<p>There are about 1,000 deadly police shootings a year, Mr. Stinson has found.</p><p>But increased attention to police misconduct, more video evidence and the precedent of a jury handing up a high-profile conviction against Mr. Chauvin are all likely to compel prosecutors to be more aggressive in such cases, the prosecutors said.</p><p>\"In the past, we knew that juries were reluctant to convict police officers,\" said Steve Wagstaffe, district attorney in California's San Mateo County and past president of the California District Attorneys Association. The Chauvin verdict will factor into prosecutors' decisions in the future if they believe that \"juries will be more willing to conclude that there can be an officer who was a bad apple and hence willing to convict,\" he said.</p><p>High legal standards for charging police officers is one reason prosecutors have been reluctant to pursue such cases. The Supreme Court has given police leeway to make split-second, life-or-death decisions based on their perceptions of danger. Officers can use deadly force if they reasonably believe that their lives or the lives of others are threatened, although there are variations in different states.</p><p>John DeCarlo, a former police chief in Connecticut and a professor at the University of New Haven, said the Chauvin case is unique because the video footage of his kneeling on Mr. Floyd showed that his actions didn't involve a split-second decision in which he feared for his life. Such a defense is common and frequently successful.</p><p>Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon, whose office is looking at reopening old police-shooting cases, said the verdict sent a message that juries are willing to hold police accountable. But he said laws need to be changed to \"create a different legal scheme that is actually a vehicle for accountability for police when they use excessive force.\"</p><p>The number of prosecutions against officers has ebbed and flowed along with public attention to high-profile incidents.</p><p>According to data collected by Mr. Stinson, prosecutions of officers for murder or manslaughter rose after the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., but dropped several years later.In 2015, 18 officers were charged, up from six the prior year, and 14 officers were charged in 2016. By 2017, however, the number had dropped to seven.</p><p>The numbers have risen again in the wake of widespread protests sparked by the murder of Mr. Floyd. Last year, 16 officers were charged with murder or manslaughter in fatal shootings. In the first four months of this year, 12 have been charged.</p><p>\"Prosecutors do feel pressure,\" Mr. Stinson said.</p><p>Law-enforcement unions worry that prosecutors will become too zealous in going after police following the Chauvin verdict.</p><p>\"There is an epidemic of overly aggressive prosecutors across the country right now,\" said Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, a police labor organization that represents roughly 330,000 officers. \"If a police officer faces the possibility of prosecution for performing the kind of appropriately aggressive policing which keeps our citizens safe in our cities and towns, it's going to have a really deleterious effect on public safety.\"</p><p>Mr. Pasco said that he respected the verdict in the Chauvin trial.</p>",
