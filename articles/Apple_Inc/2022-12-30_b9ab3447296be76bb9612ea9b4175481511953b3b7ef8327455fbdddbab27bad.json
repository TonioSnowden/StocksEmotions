  "title": "Saudi Arabia Takes Controlling Stake in Augmented-Reality Pioneer Magic Leap; Ownership shift comes as the once-highflying startup tries to revive its fortunes with new headset",
  "text": "<p>Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is focusing on building its so-called metaverse, an online realm that can be accessed through Oculus VR headsets that the company provides. Microsoft Corp. sells theHoloLens headset to business clients and the U.S. military. Snap Inc., the parent company of the social media app Snapchat, also has a goggle offering and, Apple Inc., has been expected to unveil its own augmented-reality device.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, also known as PIF, has been a longtime investor in Magic Leap. In September 2021, its stake surpassed more than 50%, according to a regulatory filing made public in the U.K. earlier this month. The filing says the investor, since last month, has secured the right to appoint four of the eight board members.</p><p>Magic Leap, which is based in Florida and, at one point, had a valuation of nearly $7 billion, said it cannot comment on individual investors and declined to say whether the Saudi fund has added any members to the board. PIF didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Daily Telegraph previously reported on PIF's controlling stake in the company.</p><p>Magic Leap had previously raised nearly $3.5 billion from investors including Alphabet Inc. venture-capital arm GV, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc.'s investment arm.</p><p>Some advocates of the technology have said it could alter how people and businesses interact not unlike the changes brought on by the smartphone revolution. The metaverse—online worlds where users can play and hangout with friends as avatars—has been touted as the future of the internet that would be experienced largely through digital goggles and headsets.</p><p>Magic Leap in 2018 introduced its first set of augmented-reality goggles, for consumers, costing around $2,300. The pricey gadget failed to take off. Magic Leap laid off a third of its staff in the early days of the pandemic and brought in a new chief executive.</p><p>Larger tech companies also have had problems with their headset endeavors. Microsoft initially targeted its device also at consumers, though has now changed focus to corporate clients that can offer the pricey devices. Its efforts to provide the technology to the U.S. Army also has encountered difficulties. Meta has struggled to retain users for its virtual-reality app Horizon Worlds. Snap added augmented-reality software to its most recent iteration of its camera-equipped sunglasses, though hasn't made them available to the general public.</p><p>The companies have said they remain upbeat about the technology's prospects. Meta unveiled a new headset aimed at professionals in October. Snap also has signaled it remains committed to the technology.</p><p>International Data Corp., which tracks the market for such devices, earlier this month reduced its outlook for global shipments of augmented-reality and virtual-reality headsets. The firm now expects shipments to decline by roughly 13% in 2022, to about 9.7 million unit shipments. Previously, IDC had forecast shipments for 2022 would grow by more than 45%.</p><p>Magic Leap, in 2020, hired Peggy Johnson, who had been a top deal maker at Microsoft, as its new CEO to revive the company's prospects. The new headset, Magic Leap 2, was released in September at a cost starting from $3,299 per device, the company has said, and is targeted at uses such as workplace training and healthcare.</p><p>Ms. Johnson, in a company blog post this month, said, \"We're seeing increasing demand for AR solutions today\" and that the company was adding engineering, software and other staff to compete.</p><p>—For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter .</p><p>Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com and Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com</p><p>Saudi Arabia Takes Controlling Stake in Augmented-Reality Pioneer Magic Leap</p>",
