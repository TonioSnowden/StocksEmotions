  "text": "<p>Amazon executive Andy Jassy is set to be handed a stock package worth more than $200m when he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7475ae98-7e25-4d6f-8470-e8b9effb0ee7\">takes over</a> from Jeff Bezos as chief executive on Monday.</p> <p>In a regulatory filing on Friday, the company said it had approved the 61,000-share plan — to vest over the next 10 years — and elected the 53-year-old to the company's board of directors.</p> <p>Jassy has been at <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/stream/84cf4073-a674-4a93-aef9-dcc1832a65cb\">Amazon</a> since 1997, and is stepping up from his role as chief executive of AWS, Amazon's cloud computing arm, which he has led since its inception in 2006.</p> <p>He will take the helm on July 5, the 27th anniversary of the company's founding, in what will be Amazon's first-ever leadership transition.</p> <p>Bezos will become executive chair, and has said he plans to dedicate more time to personal endeavours, such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/956cb2cf-ab9e-45d2-bc47-1c19f5458ba8\">space travel</a> and his ownership of The Washington Post.</p> <p>Amazon's stock ended the week priced at $3,510.98, valuing Jassy's award at just over $214m. However, the value could be considerably higher once fully vested: in the past 10 years, Amazon's stock price has increased by more than 1,500 per cent. Its market capitalisation currently stands at $1.77tn.</p> <p>Jassy's award comes in addition to the 88,538 shares he already holds, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ, and 48,756 that had yet to vest by the end of 2020. </p> <p>The holding already made <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/1072bdf3-bba3-4b6d-a5a0-1513f407768c\">Jassy</a> the second-largest individual shareholder at the company, behind <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Jeff_Bezos\">Bezos</a>, whose stake is worth $176bn.</p> <p>Amazon did not outline any performance targets in relation to the award. A company spokesman declined to comment.</p> <p>Hefty stock grants are typical for Big Tech executives stepping into top jobs. In 2012 Apple awarded Tim Cook 1m in restricted stock units, valued at the time at $376m, as he took over from the late Steve Jobs.</p> <p>In 2019 Sundar Pichai was awarded $276m worth of shares and options in Google owner Alphabet, partly dependent on hitting performance targets.</p> <p>Satya Nadella, who was appointed chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, received $59m, also performance-based.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco</em></p><p>Source: Dave Lee in San Francisco 2021 'Andy Jassy to net $214m in Amazon stock on taking over from Jeff Bezos' FT.com 3 July.
