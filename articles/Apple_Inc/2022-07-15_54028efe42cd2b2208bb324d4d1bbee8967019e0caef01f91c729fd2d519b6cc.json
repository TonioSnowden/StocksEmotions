  "text": "<p>   Amazon.com Inc. said this year's Prime Day event, its annual shopping blitz, was its biggest ever, offering few specifics in a year when shoppers are being squeezed by inflation. </p><p>   Amazon said in a statement Thursday morning that customers purchased more than 300 million items during the event, adding that some of the bestselling goods were premium beauty products, Apple Watches, diapers and kitchen items. </p><p>   The company said it sold more Amazon devices during this Prime Day than any other and that Prime members saved more than $1.7 billion from shopping the deals. </p><p>   The e-commerce giant didn't report its total revenue during the two-day event, which was held Tuesday and Wednesday. It said small and medium-size businesses saw more sales growth on its website during the event than the company's own retail business. </p><p>   Amazon shares rose slightly Thursday amid a mixed day for the markets. The stock has lost roughly one-third of its value so far this year. </p><p>   Amazon launched Prime Day in 2015 in hopes that it would boost summer sales during what is often a slow quarter for the company, making it a summer Black Friday of sorts. Experts have said that Prime Day could serve as a bellwether for consumer shopping amid inflation. </p><p>   The event also drives new subscribers to its Prime membership program because only members can shop the deals. The company on Thursday said that it had more than 200 million Prime members. </p><p>   This year's Prime Day revenue in the U.S. reached $11.9 billion, Adobe reported Thursday, up from $11 billion during last year's event. Toys and electronics were among the most steeply discounted items. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sebastian Herrera contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
