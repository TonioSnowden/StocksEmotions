  "text": "<p>Chris Rokos and Jeffrey Talpins are among high-profile hedge fund managers who were wrongfooted when rising inflation expectations jolted equity and bond markets last month. </p> <p>Government bonds and mega-cap technology stocks have tumbled in recent weeks as investors have rapidly shifted away from positions seen as good bets during the pandemic-driven economic downturn. Many have moved into lowly valued stocks likely to prosper as growth and inflation return, and that rotation of positioning has hit some of last year's top performing managers.</p> <p>Among those in the red is Mayfair-based Rokos Capital Management, one of the world's biggest macro funds with $14.5bn in assets.</p> <p>The firm, set up by former Brevan Howard co-founder Rokos suffered a 3 per cent fall in February, say people familiar with its performance. That leaves the fund down around 2 per cent this year, said one of the people. Last year it gained around 44 per cent, its best ever performance. Rokos declined to comment.</p> <p>Talpins' Element Capital, another big gainer during the pandemic, lost 7.3 per cent in February, according to people familiar with its performance. That leaves the fund down around 7.9 per cent since the end of 2020. Element declined to comment.</p> <p>Macro funds, which bet on broad economic trends, overall gained 3.6 per cent in February, taking gains this year to 3.8 per cent, according to data group HFR.</p> <p>New York-based Element, which manages around $15bn in assets and gained 18.8 per cent last year, made one of the most prescient investment calls of the pandemic in late October when <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32ca4cc7-9ad1-4fec-8380-ce5556aeaaa4\">it predicted</a> that results from drug giant Pfizer's phase 3 vaccine trials would be far better than investors had been expecting.&#xa0;</p> <p>The losses suffered by some of the hedge fund industry's biggest and most respected managers highlights how difficult markets have proved to trade this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Long-term US government bonds have dropped around 11 per cent in price so far in 2021, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index that tracks Treasuries with maturities of 10 years or longer. The sell-off has come as investors have bet that huge levels of US fiscal stimulus, on top of ultra-loose monetary policy, could fuel a resurgence in inflation. </p> <p>In the stock market, the Nasdaq Composite, which includes many big technology stocks such as Tesla, is down around 7 per cent from the high it hit less than one month ago. </p> <p>Robert Gibbins's Autonomy Capital has also struggled recently. Its Global Macro fund lost 5.5 per cent last month, according to performance numbers seen by the Financial Times. The fund suffered losses in last spring's market turmoil, but rebounded strongly later in the year.</p> <p>The losses stand in contrast to gains made by managers including Andrew Law's Caxton Associates and Brevan Howard, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53097c24-b13d-4936-8fd9-01517c862efc\">have profited</a> from positioning for the drop in bond prices. </p> <p>Some managers have also profited from a rally in beaten-down sectors such as banks and energy, which have rebounded strongly this year. </p> <p>Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital, which manages around $9bn in assets and which has profited from a position in GameStop, gained around 25 per cent last month, leaving it up more than 13 per cent.</p> <p>Autonomy and Maverick declined to comment.</p> <p><em>laurence.fletcher@ft.com</em></p><p>Source: Laurence Fletcher in London 2021 'Hedge fund managers Talpins and Rokos stung by February market tumult' FT.com 11 March.
