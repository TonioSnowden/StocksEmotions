With his \"Pigeon\" stories, his comic easy-reader series \"Elephant &amp; Piggie\" and \"Unlimited Squirrels,\" and the \"Knuffle Bunny\" books that first brought him fame, Mr. Willems has become something of a hero to the under-6 age cohort. This prolific humorist has, it turns out, a pensive side. As artist-in-residence at the Kennedy Center, and while under the influence of Beethoven, Mr. Willems expressed himself by way of abstract paintings. A selection of these artworks forms the illustration for \"Opposites Abstract\" (Hyperion, 38 pages, $14.99), a concept book for children and their parents. </p><p>\n  As the title indicates, Mr. Willems is exploring ideas that oppose one another, or contrast in some way. With a typical concept book, the opposites would be clear cut: Up or down? Hot or cold? Wet or dry? That's not what happens here. The pairings Mr. Willems has contrived do not so much establish essential differences between things as draw our attention to certain relativistic qualities. For instance, the initial two paintings in the book depict a circle on a square background. The first resembles a full moon during a lunar eclipse, with a dark orb (containing, we see on second look, an even darker center) that seems to float against a dimly lit sky. The text asks: \"Is this dark?\" The following page shows a lighter orb (with a white center) against a gray field and the question: \"Is this light?\" Well, it depends. The pattern persists through other abstract images arranged to evoke dualities, such as mechanical/organic, individual/group, and intentional/accidental. These concepts are comparatively sophisticated, making \"Opposites Abstract\" less than ideal for babies and toddlers, but those farther along in their development will find it a mind-stretcher. </p><p>\n  Carter Higgins has hit the sweet spot with \"Circle Under Berry\" (Chronicle, 48 pages, $15.99), a sparkling and ingenious concept book for children ages 2-4 that I suspect will become a nursery staple. Essentially, Ms. Higgins moves colorful shapes around from one clean white page to another while asking the reader, in straightforward prose, to notice what she's doing. Described here, her text may sound facile but in combination with the pictures it positively tingles. \"Circle under berry / berry over square / circle over berry under orange over square,\" we read over the opening four pages. In the second four, Ms. Higgins smuggles a little orange fish into the selection: \"Yellow under diamond / diamond over green / yellow over diamond under guppy over green.\" The shifting positions of the shapes and the steady introduction of surprises make reading this book feel like the best kind of educational game. While reading (and re-reading, because it's that sort of book) \"Circle Under Berry,\" I kept thinking of Emily Gravett's clever and rather beautiful 2006 picture book \"Orange Pear Apple Bear,\" which would be a lot of fun to read alongside it. </p><p>\n  Three times, picture-book creator Laura Vaccaro Seeger has wrought meaning and serendipity from the permutations of a single hue. First came \"Green\" in 2012, which considered the many shades and tints of that color. Then came \"Blue\" in 2018, which traced the friendship and aging of a boy and his dog. Now comes \"Red\" (Neal Porter, 34 pages, $18.99), which tells of a solitary fox kit. </p><p>\n  As in her previous color-stories, our eye travels in \"Red\" through thickly painted landscapes with little cutouts that frame daubs of color from other pictures. We encounter the little fox, \"dark red\" as it traverses a shadowy forest. We learn that the animal is lost, and see that it is vulnerable too, in its contacts with the human world. At one point, the kit bounds across an autumn meadow, heedless of the dangerous \"rust red\" nails that sprout from a pile of old wood in the foreground. Our alarm gives way to pity as, on the next page, the woebegone fox lifts its paw, \"blood red\" from its encounter with the spikes. </p><p>\n  There's a stronger sense of melancholy in \"Red\" than in the other two books of the informal trilogy; a result, Ms. Seeger explains in a brief afterword, of her distress at the country's political polarization. There's nothing political in the story, though, and thanks to a tender final scene of reunion, children ages 3 to 7 won't be left feeling bereft. Any number of nonfiction books will tell children about the exceptional, the unusual and the bizarre. </p><p>\n  What's far less common, understandably enough, are books about the bland and quotidian. Yet there is surprising depth and history to things that may not naturally excite our curiosity, as children ages 6-10 will discover in \"Encyclopedia of Ordinary Things\" (Albatros, 96 pages, $16.95), a compendium that, if it does not live up to its pretensions, nonetheless contains interesting tidbits. Written by Stepanka Sekaninova and illustrated by Eva Chupikova, the book acquaints young readers with the origins and historical uses of 11 familiar objects: shoes, skates, umbrellas, eyeglasses, dolls, perfume, \"horse toys\" (such as the hobbyhorse), tights (and stockings), toilets, beds and toothbrushes. Ms. Chupikova's pictures are stylized and slightly distempered. In the shoe section, she depicts a minstrel wearing leather slippers so elongated that their curved tips must be secured to his waistband; in the pages devoted to perfume, we see Cleopatra surrounded by the seven flowers and herbs used in her favorite scent. Ms. Sekaninova's text, meanwhile, is light, informal and sometimes more speculative than authoritative. For instance, she writes that umbrellas may have originated in prehistory when \"our ancestors became annoyed with getting sunburnt from being exposed to direct sunlight all the time, and so they plucked a large leaf -- a palm leaf, whenever possible -- and hid themselves in its shade.\" Maybe! </p><p></p>",
