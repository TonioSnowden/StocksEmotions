  "title": "How 9/11 Changed Art; In the aftermath of the terror attacks, some artists and photographers dealt directly with the cataclysm, but in the years that followed most failed to fully engage with the horrors of that day",
  "text": "<p>That period of hair-trigger anxiety has passed. After 2007, when Apple introduced the iPhone and everyone began to take pictures of everything, regulating what could be recorded grew almost impossible. By 2011, an estimated 30 million more security cameras had been installed in the U.S. to monitor streets and infrastructure as never before.</p><p>The lasting effects on artists and the art world over 20 years are harder to measure. The most visible response was the overwhelming number of photographs, films and exhibitions dealing forthrightly with the tragedy that soon appeared. The largest was the sprawling \"Here Is New York: A Democracy of Photographs,\" a 2002 pop-up show in SoHo and book to which hundreds contributed, amateurs and professionals alike. (Excerpts of that event are now at the New-York Historical Society.)</p><p>Other notable projects included \"New York: September 11\" (2001), a collaborative volume by 11 members of the Magnum photography collective who were in the city that day. Joel Meyerowitz chronicled the years-long excavation and cleanup of the World Trade Center site in his monumental \"Aftermath\" (2006). Kevin Bubriski's \"Pilgrimage: Looking at Ground Zero\" (2002) took an indirect approach, portraying the dazed faces of visitors staring at the ruins. Tony Oursler's 57-minute video \"9/11\" (2001) was perhaps the most personal account, a recital of events that begins in his apartment after the first plane struck and ends at night in a walk around his downtown neighborhood.</p><p>Artists in recent years have tended to avoid direct references to the World Trade Center and instead concentrated on the repercussions of the attacks, as the so-called war on terror spread around the globe.</p><p>The disgrace of Abu Ghraib, the Iraqi prison where it was revealed in 2004 that prisoners had been tortured and humiliated by their American captors, incited the Colombian artist Fernando Botero, famous for his lighthearted scenes of the pneumatically obese, to make a series of paintings and drawings of naked, bloodied bodies in prison cells.</p><p>Debi Cornwall's \"Welcome to Camp America: Inside Guantanamo Bay\" (2017) explored the absurdity of foreign detainees held in an American prison in, of all places, Cuba, one that, due to political pressure, no president has been able to dismantle. A civil-rights lawyer and photographer, she has created a book and traveling exhibition that mixes portraits of prisoners and guards (she was forbidden to show their faces) with legal documents, images of leisure areas, and souvenirs available at the military base's gift shop.</p><p>One of the few American artists to address the massacre of nearly 3,000 people in a matter of hours was Eric Fischl. His bronze sculpture \"Tumbling Woman\" (2002) depicts the flailing arms and legs of someone hitting the ground after jumping or falling from the towers. Installed at Rockefeller Center on the first anniversary of 9/11, its imagined moment of terror, helplessness and individual death was deemed too upsetting for the public to behold and was quickly removed.</p><p>In an email, Mr. Fischl acknowledged the difficulty of making art about \"a disappearance, a vanishing.\" It has been easier to \"grieve over the loss of architecture as though that could possibly make us fully grasp the loss of those we have loved.\"</p><p>He remains scathingly critical of his colleagues for failing to engage with the sickening reality of that day. \"The American art world did not generally respond to the tragedy of 9/11 even though most everyone felt its effects. Many felt that photojournalism had captured enough of it so little remained to be said. This showed to me how few artists truly understand how art works, how important it is to our society in the moment we live, how it gives us a shared language to connect us on levels deeper than images or physical truth. To me in that moment American artists abnegated their responsibilities as citizens.\"</p><p>Mr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.</p><p>How 9/11 Changed Art</p>",
