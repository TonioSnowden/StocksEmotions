  "text": "<p>When Target set out plans in 2017 to prioritise its bricks-and-mortar stores to combat the competitive onslaught from Amazon, investors made their disapproval clear. On the day executives earmarked $7bn to pursue the strategy, shares in the US retail group <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/target-to-launch-new-brands-lower-prices-after-quarterly-results-disappoint/414955904/\">dropped</a> 12 per cent. </p> <p>“A strong view was that store retailing was dead and companies that led with digital would ultimately take over,” John Mulligan, chief operating officer, recalled in a Financial Times interview.</p> <p>“Conventional wisdom isn't always right,” he said. “It was pretty clear to us that digital was going to grow, no question, but stores were still going to matter.”</p> <p>Four years on, few on Wall Street deny that Target's investments have paid off. While shoppers have deserted malls and department stores during the pandemic, they have flocked to Target's brightly lit and well organised megastores.</p> <p>Revenues in 2020 <a href=\"https://investors.target.com/news-releases/news-release-details/target-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020\">leapt 20</a> per cent to $93.6bn, driven by in-store traffic as well as ecommerce. Shares have leapt 170 per cent since authorities began ordering Americans to stay at home in March 2020, and&#xa0;last&#xa0;week Target's market capitalisation topped $130bn.</p> <p>As internet shopping becomes ever more popular, however, the company is facing an important test. Unlike Amazon and other online specialists that run warehouse networks, Target is dependent on physical stores to meet ecommerce demand.</p> <p>To package goods for delivery, workers sort them inside stores — an arrangement that Zain Akbari, retail analyst at Morningstar, said had “natural inefficiencies”. As customers place more orders online, these would become “harder and harder to overcome”.</p> <h2>Fortune and foresight</h2> <p>Good fortune, not strategic foresight, explains at least some of Target's outperformance during the pandemic. While authorities forced other retailers to close for weeks, they allowed Target — alongside Walmart and some other chains — to stay open throughout on the grounds that they sell food and other essential goods alongside discretionary items. Target's big box outlets stock a wide range of merchandise, from tuna to towels and televisions.</p> <p>Despite having such a big advantage over department stores, clothing chains and other rivals, Target executives said it was far from inevitable the company should have emerged as one of the pandemic's big corporate winners.</p> <p>Results this week are expected to show the chain has consolidated gains made at the onset of the crisis: same-store sales in the three months to July rose 9 per cent year on year, according to consensus analyst estimates. </p> <p>Profits have also jumped during the pandemic, although in the most recent quarter net income is forecast to have held steady from a year ago at about $1.7bn — in part, said Ed Yruma at KeyBanc Capital Markets, because of upward pressure on wages at the retailer, which as of the end of January employed 409,000 people. </p> <p>Target, whose first outlet opened in Minnesota in 1962, has not always been a customer favourite. The company went through a particularly rough patch in 2013, when customer details were compromised in a cyber attack and it embarked on an <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/why-targets-canadian-expansion-failed\">ill-fated</a> expansion into Canada. Brian Cornell, a former head of Walmart's Sam's Club business, was brought in as chief executive the following year to lead a turnround.</p> <p>Mulligan, Target COO, said that in mapping out how to recover, executives spent a lot of time gauging customer views. “One thing they told us was: if I'm going to come to your store, it better be a great environment.”</p> <p>Experimental refits on 25 stores followed. Mulligan said: “We did a lot of testing. Some of it worked, some of it didn't, but that became the basis for how we were going to remodel stores.”</p> <p>In contrast to other retailers loaded with debt — often backed by private equity — Target's leverage has remained at serviceable levels, giving managers scope to invest. Even at the height of its 2013 troubles, net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation did not rise much above 2 times, according to Bloomberg data.</p> <p>The resulting plan was hardly revolutionary: upgrades involved features such as wider aisles and clearer signage. But as other retailers have starved stores of investment, Target has stood out. Remodelled outlets typically produce at least 2 per cent higher revenues than the company average.</p> <p>A line-up of popular own-brand goods, from Threshold furniture to Cat &amp; Jack kids' clothing, has also helped woo shoppers.</p> <p>While aimed squarely at the mass market, Target has a reputation as a trendier alternative to Walmart. Younger shoppers refer jokingly to the chain as Tarjay as if it was a French boutique, a nod to its cheap chic selection.</p> <p>Better staff training had also improved the in-store experience, Mulligan said. Previously, he said, “if you went into our beauty department you wouldn't have got a team member who really knew anything about beauty. We've come a long way there.”</p> <p>This month the company is rolling out Ulta Beauty shops-in-shops, alongside similar partnerships in other departments with Apple, Disney and Levi's.</p> <h2>Ecommerce with a need for stores</h2> <p>Target has put its nearly 2,000 stores at the centre of its online strategy. Drive Up, through which customers order online and collect from stores, has been very popular during the pandemic. The service, which contributed only about 5 per cent to the company's digital sales two years ago, now produces more than 30 per cent.</p> <p>Click and collect has an obvious advantage for a retailer, Mulligan noted. “If you look at the economics of a shipped order, the big thing is the ship cost,” he said. “If we can eliminate [that] . . . those are economics we will take.”</p> <p>While Target is seeking to reduce “last-mile” shipping costs, delivery remains trickier. Whereas Amazon has dedicated ecommerce warehouses, Target dispatches the vast majority of orders from its stores.</p> <p>Mulligan said it made sense for Target to make the most of its stores, not least because about 80 per cent of its inventory is housed there and about three-quarters of Americans live within 10 miles of one.</p> <p>The set-up has its drawbacks, however. To fetch goods for online shoppers, workers walk through stores built for customer browsing.</p> <p>Target has rolled out handheld devices for staff “pickers” so they can better navigate the aisles, among other initiatives to speed up collections. Still, Morningstar retail analyst Akbari said that having stores cater simultaneously to virtual and in-person shoppers “forces compromises”. While Target stores were better positioned than other chains, he added, they were still “not ideal for digital fulfilment”.</p> <p>Target said its system had plenty of capacity to handle more orders.</p> <h2>An unpopular strategy that worked out</h2> <p>As other retailers struggle to regain their footing, Target is seeking to take advantage of the resulting turmoil in commercial real estate. It plans to open 30 stores this year, with a particular focus on smaller outlets in college campuses and urban centres. A second outlet on New York's Upper West Side opened this weekend.</p> <p>If it is to build on its status as being among the savviest operators in retail, though, Target has plenty of improvements to make.</p> <p>Gaps appeared on shelves in departments from electronics to homewares last year, when lockdowns caused demand for some products to surge. While the circumstances of the pandemic were unforeseen, Mulligan said the company's management of shortages was “frankly not quite good enough”.</p> <p>Target also needed to do a better job, said Neil Saunders, retail managing director of the GlobalData consultancy, of having its internal systems “talk to each other properly. One of the persistent niggles is that the price customers see on the mobile app frequently doesn't match the price they see in the store.”</p> <p>Yet he said Target's strategy of store-led investment, initially “very unpopular” among investors, had worked out.</p> <p>“When Target did it, it wasn't really a very common narrative,” Saunders said. Wall Street had felt stores were “the wrong thing to invest in. Of course, they were absolutely the right thing to invest in.”</p><p>Source: Alistair Gray 2021 'US retailer Target defies bricks-and-mortar doubters' FT.com 16 August.
