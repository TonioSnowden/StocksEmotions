I am drawn to Portuguese tiles but am open to other ideas. What do you think?</strong></p> <p>A delightful idea. Azulejos, the unique tiles that Portugal is so well-known for, are found on the interior and exterior of all kinds of buildings and structures, from grand churches, palaces and fountains to restaurants, park benches and train stations. </p> <p>They came with the Moors in the 15th century, but fell out of fashion in the early 1900s. Thankfully, a resurgence of interest began in the 1950s and now they seem more popular than ever.</p> <p>If you want to shop for antique Portuguese tiles online, I advise starting with Solar, a company that specialises in these and other decorative arts from the country. Browse the website and discover an incredible array of colour and pattern. </p> <p>I particularly love their selection of early tiles, from the 15th and 16th centuries, all azure blues, jade greens and mustards in swirling, kaleidoscopic arrangements.</p> <p>Heading across the border into Spain for a moment, I am intrigued by Maitland &amp; Poate, a London-based, family-run business that grew from a passion for sourcing reclaimed encaustic tiles from Andalucía. Many of their antique tiles have interesting stories. </p> <p>Take Cuero Viejo, which features a traditional stencil design in off-white on a burgundy background. These were reclaimed from an entrance to a mansion in Córdoba. Or how about Viso, discovered in the kitchen of a small finca between Sevilla and Jerez de la Frontera? (I love the way the natural pigments in these tiles have faded and aged.)</p> <p>My absolute favourite might be the Juan Centro tiles with their beautiful diamond-shaped brown, marbled pattern and thin green border. Tiles such as these deserve another life — they're humble and honest and completely elegant. </p> <p>They are larger than your standard ceramic tiles, however, and are usually used for floors, although I have seen them surrounding fireplaces. Encaustic tiles are made from clay and cement and are not glazed and decorated in the way that Portuguese or Delft ceramic tiles are.</p> <p>Speaking of Delft, it could be interesting to consider an entirely different sort of design. I love a geometric tile, but I can never resist a good dose of Delft. </p> <p>Enter Klaas Regts: a Dutchman who, as a child, found his first Delft tiles (17th-century, decorated with rare animals) in the garden of his family home. Regts was hooked and eventually his stash of antique Delft tiles became the largest private collection in the world.</p> <p>Regts's son, Durk, founded Regts, the company, in 2014, and began dealing. They have some beautiful things on offer. I've been eyeing up a couple of tiles in particular: mermen from 1650, one playing a violin and the other shooting a bow and arrow. </p> <p>Admittedly, many are rather expensive (the aquatic archer will set you back €250), but you may not need many for your fireplace — unless you are decorating a larger area of the chimney breast, rather than just within the surround.</p> <p>(Personally, I adore the idea of a much larger collection of these Delft tiles entirely lining a small room, such as a bathroom. Or even a large room! I'm thinking of the kitchen at the Amalienburg, the hunting lodge at Munich's Nymphenburg Palace.)</p> <p>Douglas Watson Studio, by the way, makes excellent Delft-inspired tiles in its Oxfordshire workshop.</p> <p>Consider, also, English Victorian and Edwardian tiles. Nottingham Architectural Antiques and Reclamation is selling individual hand-painted and transfer tiles reclaimed from various sources including porches and fireplaces. </p> <p>When I worked for the architectural and interior designer Ben Pentreath, we covered a giant kitchen backsplash in a London house with a huge amount of this kind of tile — each selected for their charming pattern.</p> <p>Until I have an entire bathroom (or even a fireplace) to tile, I use the odd few I've collected as saucers for pot plants. Or I'll prop one up on a mantelpiece. Whatever you do, go bold with your tiles. And, if you can, choose those with history and a bit of romance attached.</p> <p>Give neglected old tiles a delightful new home — I am entranced by the idea of using those reclaimed from a crumbling finca, farmhouse or railway station. </p> <p>Or buy new, but choose well, which leads me to my final suggestion: London's Balineum makes a fantastic mottled tile in eight colourways, inspired by Victorian interiors. I am desperate to use these somewhere. </p> <p>The emerald green and sky blue versions are sublime — psychedelic and mesmerising. Stare at this tile and suddenly it's a hot summer's day and you're squinting through dark leaves to a piercing cerulean sky. Much needed in January.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
