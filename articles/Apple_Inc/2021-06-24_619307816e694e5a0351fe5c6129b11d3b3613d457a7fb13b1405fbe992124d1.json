China, with Hong Kong as its special administrative region, is no different. Hong Kong remains a secure, open and dynamic environment that welcomes investors and entrepreneurs from around the world.</p><p>John K.C. Lee</p><p>Secretary for security</p><p>Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region</p><p>---</p><p>The arrest of Ryan Law, the editor of Apple Daily, is another nail in the coffin of Hong Kong's diminished independence, and as you write in your editorial, \"Businesses of all kinds, beware.\" What Beijing fails to grasp -- and never will because it is a dictatorship -- is that acts like arresting Mr. Law establish that it cannot be trusted about anything, and that it will twist and manipulate false laws to perpetuate its grip on the throats of talented Chinese people. World, beware.</p><p>James Tuthill</p><p>Oro Valley, Ariz.</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Hong Kong Tries and Fails To Defend the Indefensible\" -- WSJ June 29, 2021)</p>",
