  "title": "Stock Futures Swing as Concerns Mount Over Fed Tightening; Markets have been buffeted by concerns about inflation and interest rates",
  "text": "<p>The Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.1%, reversing direction after falling more than 1%. Asia-Pacific indexes fell sharply, with gauges in China, Japan and South Korea hitting their lowest closing levels in more than a year.</p><p>The moves built on a bout of volatility in the U.S. stock market that has seen major indexes swing wildly in intraday trading this week. The VIX hit its highest level in a year on Wednesday. Markets have been buffeted by concerns about central-bank policy around interest rates and inflation and geopolitical tensions over Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>Earnings season is ongoing and is seen as the next big test of whether the stock market's sky-high valuations can be justified.</p><p>\"What I'm looking for this earnings season is inflationary pressures and margins—if companies are able to hold onto their profits,\" Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. said. \"Are they able to pass along prices, are they able to maintain pricing power?\" As central banks rein in liquidity, that is what becomes really important, he added.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Fed signaled it would begin raising interest rates in mid-March, its latest step toward removing stimulus to bring down inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank could continue to lift rates faster than it did during the past decade.</p><p>The news shows the central bank \"is in a hurry,\" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management in Tokyo. \"The Fed got serious really fast and it's having an effect on markets.\"</p><p>Uncertainty over a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine is casting a pall, analysts said. Russia is a major energy exporter and oil prices have remained high even as stocks have fallen. The Fed won't be comfortable about inflation until oil prices decline, said Mr. Vail.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 1.835% Thursday from 1.845%. Shorter-dated government bonds continued to sell off, with the two-year Treasury yield rising to 1.208%, notching a new pandemic high.</p><p>The greenback strengthened, with the WSJ Dollar Index rising to the highest level in nine weeks.</p><p>\"The yields in the U.S. have gone up as the path of rate hikes increases. There's a bit of a safe-haven play mixed in there as well, that will be a support environment for the dollar,\" said Mr. Kamal.</p><p>McDonalds, Mastercard, Comcast, Blackstone and Southwest Airlines are set to post results before Thursday's opening bell. Apple, Visa and food and beverage giant Mondelez are due to report after markets close.</p><p>Tesla shares declined 0.8% in off-hours trading after the electric-vehicle maker posted a record profit. Chief Executive Elon Musk said that he wouldn't introduce new models this year and that the company had been affected by supply-chain disruptions.</p><p>Data on gross domestic product in the final quarter of 2021 will go out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists forecasted the economy grew at a solid pace, propelled by consumer spending, business investment and efforts to rebuild inventories. Momentum may have been affected in recent weeks by the Omicron.</p><p>Fresh data on jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, will also be released at 8:30 a.m. Analysts are anticipating a decline amid a tight labor market. Information on orders for durable and capital goods in December is scheduled for the same time.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies edged down, with bitcoin extending its decline into a third day to trade below $36,000. Ether fell 1.7%. Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, is winding down its plans to build a cryptocurrency payments network and is selling its technology to a small bank, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>—Quentin Webb contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com, Suryatapa Bhattacharya at Suryatapa.Bhattacharya@wsj.com and Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Swing as Concerns Mount Over Fed Tightening</p>",
