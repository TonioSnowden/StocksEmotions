  "title": "Pinterest Investors Should Buy Elliott's Vision; Investors have reason to believe Elliott Management's involvement should make for an effective wake-up call to the company",
  "text": "<p>Elliott has historically urged radical change at companies it believes are highly undervalued. In 2020, it pushed for the departure of Twitter's Jack Dorsey, who resigned as chief executive of the company he co-founded last year.</p><p>At eBay, Elliott pushed for the spinoff of StubHub and Classifieds—assets that the company ultimately decided to sell off in 2019 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>Elliott hasn't said publicly what changes it desires at Pinterest, but Wall Street seems happy to settle for a catalyst of any kind. Shares of the beleaguered image sharing company, which had lost about three quarters of their value over the past year as of Thursday's close, flew 16% Friday following the Journal's report.</p><p>Loudmouthed Elliott had been pretty quiet in the public markets of late—something that may have to do with the digestion of its January acquisition with Vista Equity Partners of software maker Citrix Systems, or with the epic crash that has torpedoed the tech market this year.</p><p>As such, a large position at this time is likely a reflection of the firm's particular conviction on Pinterest's opportunity.</p><p>It certainly is difficult to imagine things getting much worse for Pinterest at this point. After a brief pandemic pop, many of its users seem to have migrated to more addictive pastures, compounding what has already been a tough economic environment for social-media companies thanks to slower ad spending and Apple privacy changes.</p><p>For a brief moment last year, it seemed like PayPal might swoop in to acquire the platform, but in the end the payments company walked.</p><p>Given Elliott's history of advocating for management changes at the top, Pinterest's recent appointment of Bill Ready as its new chief executive offers the best clues as to what direction Elliott will vie for. According to the Journal's report, Pinterest has been in talks with Elliott for the past several weeks. Since Mr. Ready was appointed late last month, Elliott probably wasn't behind that change, but was likely supportive of it.</p><p>Mr. Ready's background, which spans executive roles in commerce and payments at Alphabet's Google, PayPal and its subsidiaries, suggests Pinterest finally will play to its strengths. Some platforms' specialties, like Twitter as a source of news or TikTok as a source of mindless, swipeable videos, have theoretically broad appeal.</p><p>By contrast, Pinterest as a place to be inspired by pretty online image squares, is probably never going to be everyone's cup of tea.</p><p>But it can certainly milk the users it has. Pinterest is highly utilized by those controlling the majority of household spending—mothers who come to its platform with shopping intent.</p><p>If you have been on Pinterest in the past, chances are you have found something you liked and been frustrated by the inability to buy it. That is bad in that it may have been the reason you lost interest in the platform to begin with; but it is great in that it shows what Pinterest can be.</p><p>If you want to buy all the things on Pinterest, the combination of Mr. Ready's leadership and Elliott's involvement suggests that one day soon you probably will be able to.</p><p>Elliott's history shows it will likely push for speed and focus: With Twitter, Elliott complained the company was falling woefully behind rapidly transforming competitors like Meta Platforms. With eBay, Elliott griped about a business with a valuable core, distracted by ancillary bets.</p><p>One key difference between Elliott's recent campaigns and Pinterest is that former Chief Executive Ben Silbermann has a 37% voting stake at Pinterest thanks to super voting shares, whereas Twitter's single class of stock meant little founder control. For that reason, Elliott will probably need Mr. Silbermann's buy-in to proceed.</p><p>That isn't unlikely, though, since Pinterest already was heading in the direction of commerce—in theory. The problem is that the vast majority of the platform's revenue still comes from ads even while shopping has long been a strategic priority.</p><p>Dreaming may have been on brand for a company built to inspire. But investors now have reason to hope for a new brand of execution.</p><p>Write to Laura Forman at laura.forman@wsj.com</p><p>Pinterest Investors Should Buy Elliott's Vision</p>",
