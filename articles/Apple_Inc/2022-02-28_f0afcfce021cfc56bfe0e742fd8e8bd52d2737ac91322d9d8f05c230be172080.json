Both are reviewed here,&#xa0;with the outgoing model reviewed in italics.</p><p>Price:&#xa0;The all-new 2022 Land Rover Range Rover ranges from $104,000 to $163,500.&#xa0;The outgoing 2022 Range Rover starts at $92,000.</p><p>The Land Rover Range Rover isn't merely a luxury full-size SUV. It's the archetypal luxury full-size SUV, the godfather of grand 4x4s, the original opulent off-roader. It's the flagship of the Land Rover marque, just as much at home in Death Valley as it is on Manhattan's Upper West Side.</p><p>Also see:The 25 bestselling SUVs</p><p>The all-new 2022 Range Rover ups its game with a svelte, all-new design, available 3-row seating, new engines, and forthcoming EV versions.</p><p>Land Rover&#xa0;is reinforcing the Range Rover's position as the king of the hill luxury SUV, with wide-ranging improvements that include major engineering changes and new, upscale interior features.</p><p>Among the numerous refinements are an executive seating option, mosaic patterned wood console veneers, and even an enhanced air purification system that can keep out viruses, including COVID-19.</p><p>Land Rover wants to fend off challenges to its luxury SUV supremacy from a growing band of fresher rivals, including the Bentley Bentayga,&#xa0;Mercedes-Benz Maybach GLS 600, and even the much more costly Rolls-Royce Cullinan. A little lower down the premium SUV pecking order, full-size models like the&#xa0;BMW X7,&#xa0;Cadillac Escalade, and&#xa0;Lexus LX&#xa0;are all challenging the Range Rover.</p><p>The outgoing 2022 Range Rover is the fourth generation, which made its debut for the 2013 model year. However, a new generation has also arrived for 2022. Meanwhile, Range Rover is still doing its high-class SUV thing of providing lavish cabins and highly capable hardware, with a whole lot of prestige added to the proceedings.</p><p>You might like:How to use telematics to monitor your teen's driving</p><p>2022 Land Rover Range Rover pricing</p><p>The least expensive of the all-new-for-2022 Range Rover lineup is the 5-seat $104,000 SE model, which comes with a turbocharged 395-horsepower 6-cylinder engine with mild-hybrid assist.</p><p>If three rows of seats are on your agenda, then the long-wheelbase (LWB) SE is available with 7 seats and the same mild-hybrid engine, for $110,000. The 3-row option is a first for Range Rover, and broadens its appeal considerably in a market segment where 3-row seating is becoming the norm.</p><p>The mild-hybrid engine produces decent performance and surprisingly good fuel economy for such a large, hefty vehicle.</p><p>For Range Rover buyers who care more about performance than fuel economy (and we suspect they are in the majority), the SE and SE LWB can both be optioned with a new, twin-turbo, 523-horsepower V-8 engine.</p><p>Prices for the V8-powered SE and SE LWB are $118,700 and $124,700 respectively.</p><p>From this point on, pricing shoots skyward as the rest of the 2022 Range Rover models head into full-blown luxury territory. All of these higher trims are powered by the V-8 engine.</p><p>The 5-seat Autobiography model checks in at $152,000, the 7-seat LWB Autobiography costs $154,000, and for $156,000 you can select the 5-seat LWB Autobiography, which gives second-row passengers extra legroom and other perks.</p><p>For the rest of the 2022 model year, two special First Edition models are on offer. Replete with even more frills than the Autobiography model, the First Edition trims are priced at $158,200 and $163,500 for the LWB version.</p><p>Don't miss:The 2022 Audi R8 is packed with power and exotic performance</p><p>While the plethora of bells and whistles provided on the Autobiography and First Edition models are nice to have, you could save yourself the price of a decent family car by sticking with the SE trims.</p><p>On the other hand, if money is no object, and it seems to be that way for many buyers in this category, the more extravagantly equipped Range Rover SV trims are on the way.</p><p>Available in standard and LWB form, the SV trims will feature exclusive interior design themes and even a 4-seat “Signature Suite” configuration, with two ultra-luxurious second-row seats. We expect SV pricing to head firmly to and beyond the $200,000 mark.</p><p>Another addition to the new Range Rover lineup arrives late in 2022 as a plug-in hybrid (PHEV). This version uses the same inline 6-cylinder engine as the mild-hybrid Range Rover, but will be paired with a much larger 38-kWh battery. With an output of 434 horsepower, Range Rover says the PHEV will be able to cover up to 62 miles on battery alone, at speeds up 87 mph.</p><p>Further down the road, an all-electric version of the new Range Rover is on tap for 2024. No details as yet, but we expect the battery pack to be very sizable to provide enough energy for such a weighty SUV.</p><p>As is the case with other premium, electrified vehicles, we predict prices on the PHEV and EV Range Rovers to be lofty, probably in the $130,000 to $160,000 range.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch:No more ‘good' vs. ‘bad' foods: 10 healthy eating ‘patterns' to prevent heart disease and death</p><p>In its least opulent form, the outgoing 2022 Range Rover has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of $92,000, plus a destination charge. After that, it's a steep and demanding climb (bring oxygen) to the long-wheelbase Range Rover SV Autobiography at $211,000.</p><p>Options are extensive and expensive. It's still possible to add another $25,000 in extras to the top SV Autobiography model.</p><p>In the context of rivals from Porsche POAHY, BMW XE:BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, the Range Rover is pricey. The&#xa0;Cayenne&#xa0;starts at around $69k and the&#xa0;X5&#xa0;about $60k. The&#xa0;GLS-Class, although a 3-row SUV, has a similar mix of indulgence and off-road talent, beginning at approximately $77k.</p><p>Looking in the other direction, the Range Rover fits right in. The&#xa0;Mercedes-Benz G-Class, for example, is about $133k. The 2-row Mercedes-Maybach GLS is around $162k, and the Bentley Bentayga starts in the region of $166k.</p><p>Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to find out how much others in your area paid for their new Range Rover.

However, we expect the new model to mitigate the problem of excessive body roll. The all-new 2022 Range Rover is based on a stiff new body platform and features a powerful, electrically controlled anti-roll system, which reacts faster to manage body motions.</p><p>What's more, the Range Rover now includes an all-wheel steering (AWS) system for the first time. This system turns the rear wheels to improve steering response at higher speeds and to provide a tighter turning circle at low speeds.</p><p>We expect AWS to transform parking the 2022 Range Rover—especially the long-wheelbase (LWB) versions — in a crowded garage, from a white-knuckle experience into a relative doddle.</p><p>Even though we doubt that few owners of $100,000-plus Range Rovers venture far from paved roads, our experience with serious off-road adventures in the vehicle show it is more than capable.</p><p>For 2022, the Range Rover continues to use Land Rover's proven terrain response system, which lets the driver select one of six driving modes to handle a variety of road and trail conditions. In a sense, it is a “set it and forget it” kind of system, which does most of the thinking for the driver when the going gets tough.</p><p>There is one big engineering change we are uncertain about until we have more experience with the 2022 Range Rover. For the new-generation Range Rover, Land Rover switches from a permanent all-wheel-drive (AWD) system to one that normally sends power to the rear axle, but feeds the front wheels when grip levels and driver input call for it.</p><p>The advantage of part-time AWD is better fuel economy, but it remains to be seen how this change affects the Range Rover's capabilities.</p><p>The outgoing 2022 Range Rover epitomizes the full-size luxury SUV. Its main mission is to be comfortable. Not even a standard adaptive air suspension could ever transform it into a corner carver. It's majestic, not frenetic.</p><p>This approach has special benefits should a Range Rover driver turn away from the tarmac and head into the wild. There's plenty of ground clearance and suspension travel, while occupants are cushioned by sumptuous seats and forgiving springs.</p><p>Much of the expertise Land Rover has gained from decades of subjecting its vehicles to the most challenging conditions on the planet is distilled into the Terrain Response system. All the driver has to do is select the appropriate mode from Mud &amp; Ruts, Grass/Gravel/Snow, Rock Crawl, or Sand, and the system adjusts responses from the engine and transmission to suit. We've been off-roading in a Range Rover — this stuff works.</p><p>All Terrain Progress Control (standard in Autobiography versions) is cruise control for adventurers, applying power or braking for whatever the moment requires. The driver only has to concentrate on steering.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>We're relieved that the all-new 2022 Range Rover corrects one of its predecessor's flaws, a subpar infotainment system, with the introduction of a large 13.1-inch curved center touchscreen and a new management system.</p><p>Called Pivi Pro, the enhanced system oversees most vehicle functions and gives haptic feedback to users when touching the screen. Land Rover claims that more than 90% of tasks are only two taps away from the home screen.</p><p>Given the complexity of the new Range Rover, it is pleasing to have an infotainment system that is better equipped to oversee its many capabilities.</p><p>As well as the Pivi Pro main screen, the driver has a separate 13.7-inch display that can be configured with digital or analog-style gauges.</p><p>Nor are rear passengers shortchanged in the 2022 Range Rover, which offers an optional rear entertainment system consisting of two 11.4-inch touchscreens mounted on the back of the front seats.</p><p>If you step up to the opulent executive-class rear seats in the forthcoming SV model, there is an 8-inch touchscreen seat controller mounted in the center armrest to control the various functions, which include seat massage. There is a refrigerator and even a powered table that rises from the center console to provide a work surface, (although we wonder how much work will be accomplished back there).</p><p>Speaking of opulence, the SV goes for broke, with exotic available materials such as inlaid micro-metals, ceramic control knobs, mosaic marquetry, and ultrasoft leathers with intricate patterns in the seats.</p><p>Moving to the rear of the new Range Rover brings us to another novel feature. Dubbed the “tailgate event suite,” this option creates a rear-facing seat in the cargo area with leather cushions, lighting, and audio, allowing one-upmanship in the pregame parking area.</p><p>The new Range Rover SE, which has a white ceramic gear shifter and volume controller, is available with three interior designer themes: Signature, Intrepid, and Serenity. In respective order, they are designed to evoke comfort, stealth, and exclusivity.</p><p>Check out: The 2022 GMC Hummer EV reviewed: The all-electric, full-size luxury pickup has real truck abilities, but a steep learning curve</p><p>Although the cabin of the outgoing 2022 Range Rover is undoubtedly upscale, plush, and fashioned from high-quality materials, there's still an understatement about the design, a tasteful restraint that makes it all the more classy.</p><p>A dual-screen arrangement is at the heart of the Range Rover's infotainment setup. It works well enough, but Land Rover has been installing a newer, faster system into some of its other vehicles.</p><p>Two seating rows in a full-size SUV bring plenty of occupant space, as well as 32 cubic feet of luggage space behind them. The long-wheelbase versions provide even more rear legroom, making the Range Rover an all-wheel-drive limousine that doesn't need roads.</p><p>The top SV Autobiography model offers tailgate event seating, where the lower half of the 2-piece tailgate flips down to form the base for a couple of seats.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>We are fans of the outgoing Range Rover's elegant and distinctive appearance, but the all-new generation goes for an even simpler, cleaner, and smoother look. The effect is stunning and unlike the busy lines of some rivals, notably Lexus, the 2022 Range is all about understatement; all the glass surfaces, and even the door handles, are flush to the body.</p><p>One benefit of the sleek body design is its low aerodynamic drag, which Land Rover claims is the lowest of any full-size SUV.</p><p>If there is a visual element that jars, it is the shark fin antennas on the roof. We are used to seeing one fin on today's electronics-laden vehicles, but the 2022 Range Rover has two!</p><p>The new Range Rover is available with no less than four different wheel sizes, from 20-inches on the base version, 21-inches on the V8 SE models, to 22-inch or 23-inch rims on the Autobiography and SV trims.</p><p>Notable: The 2022 Range Rover SV is the first vehicle from Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) to carry a new ceramic SV roundel. From now on, all Land Rovers launched by Special Vehicle Operations simply will be called SVs.</p><p>Also notable: All of the new Range Rover SVs have metal-plated trim on their grilles, lower tailgate, and bodyside graphics.</p><p>The current-generation 2022 Range Rover is going out on a stylistic high. It manages to look modern and iconic at the same time.</p><p>The original Range Rover wasn't even created by a designer, but an engineer whose impeccable logic led to lines echoed in today's model. This simple-yet-strong bearing makes the Range Rover come across as arguably more elegant than the Bentley Bentayga and Rolls-Royce Cullinan (which costs upward of $335k).</p><p>It's a bit of a mouthful to pronounce, but the Land Rover Range Rover SV Autobiography Dynamic Black Edition is more stealthy in person. The grille mesh and surround, side vents, side mirror housings, Range Rover lettering, and alloy wheels are all finished in black.</p><p>Many of the exterior paint choices are variations on black, white, gray, or silver, but there are a few more colorful hues as well. The Autobiography models allow the customer to provide their own sample, and Land Rover will create a bespoke finish. And the long-wheelbase SV Autobiography is available with a 2-tone color scheme.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Pivi Pro touchscreenThe new-for-2022 Range Rover finally gets the infotainment system it deserves in the new generation. We like the design of the screen, its responsiveness, and the way it manages the many systems in the 2022 model.</p><p>Third-row seatThe long-wheelbase version of the all-new 2022 Range Rover makes room for a proper 3rd-row seat for the first time. Unlike some rivals, the rearmost seat is not just fit for children. A 6-foot adult can climb back there with relative ease and be reasonably comfortable.</p><p>EnginesEvery luxury vehicle should have authority to its acceleration. The 2022 Range Rover certainly does. Even the 355-horsepower 6-cylinder engine develops a useful amount of torque at low revs and gets this SUV from standstill to 60 mph in 6.6 seconds. The supercharged V8 engines do the job in a whisker over five seconds. That's really impressive for something weighing about 2.5 tons.</p><p>Executive rear seatingIn the long-wheelbase SV Autobiography, the small center-rear seat folds down to become an expansive armrest between two aircraft-style executive seats. The longer wheelbase creates another 7.6 inches of rear legroom, allowing those seats to recline by 40 degrees as footrests rise up to provide even more comfort.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>Naturally, even the base version of the new 2022 Range Rover — the SE — is remarkably well-equipped.</p><p>Standard features include the 6-cylinder engine, an 8-speed automatic transmission, electronic air suspension, 21-inch wheels, and a highly capable 2-range 4-wheel drive system that includes several drive modes and an active rear differential with torque vectoring. Other standard hardware includes LED headlights, a Meridian sound system, wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto, a gesture-controlled power tailgate, and adaptive cruise control with steering assist. The base Range Rover also comes with a 13.1-inch touchscreen, a wood-trimmed leather interior, and a sliding panoramic roof.</p><p>The Autobiography model uses the twin-turbo V8 and adds heated and cooled 24-way seats covered in a finer grade of leather. This opulent English SUV also has illuminated seat belt buckles, a heated steering wheel, 4-zone climate control, a head-up display, and satellite radio.</p><p>A long-wheelbase 7-seat version of the new Range Rover is available as an Autobiography or a First Edition. In addition to the Autobiography exterior package (and badges), this Range Rover gets the V-8 engine, 22-inch wheels, heated and cooled 24-way seats (with hot stone massage), black brake calipers, heated and power-folding mirrors, soft-close doors, the 11.4-inch rear-seat entertainment, electric rear sunblinds, and what Land Rover calls Executive Class Comfort rear seats.</p><p>The First Edition builds on the Autobiography with 23-inch wheels, a higher grade of interior leather and walnut trim, plus Executive Class Comfort Plus rear seats.</p><p>You can also order a long-wheelbase 5-seater as an Autobiography or a First Edition.</p><p>Some of the standard equipment on the new Range Rover SV includes a monotone semi-aniline leather interior with uniquely shaped seats and SV-specific embroidery patterns.</p><p>The SV Bespoke Match to Sample paint service, which can replicate any exterior color a customer requests, provides virtually limitless scope for individuality.</p><p>As anyone spending the best part of $100k on the outgoing Range Rover would hope, there's a lot of standard equipment in the base model. It comes with an adaptive air suspension, Terrain Response system, 19-inch alloy wheels, panoramic sunroof, full LED exterior lighting, heated/self-dimming side mirrors with memory, hands-free tailgate operation, and rain-sensing wipers. And that's just the outside and underneath.</p><p>Inside, there's tri-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry/ignition, leather upholstery, 10-way power-adjustable front seats, power-adjustable steering column, 12.3-inch digital driver information display, reclining rear seats, and ambient LED lighting.</p><p>The infotainment setup has Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, navigation, satellite radio, Wi-Fi, two touchscreens, and a 13-speaker/380-watt Meridian sound system. Safety features include automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and parking sensors at both ends.</p><p>The Westminster versions (standard and long-wheelbase) offer many items that were popular options into a relatively value-packed standard bundle. These include 21-inch alloy wheels, soft-closing doors, heated steering wheel, heated/ventilated/20-way power-adjustable front seats, heated/power-reclining rear seats, quad-zone climate control, chiller compartment, cabin air ionization, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, high-speed emergency braking, 360-degree camera system, head-up display, and a 19-speaker/825-watt Meridian surround-sound system.</p><p>Read next:The 2022 Ford Bronco Sport is loaded with personality and rugged capability</p><p>Factory options</p><p>Many of the option choices on the new 2022 Range Rover are paints. Premium metallic paint, in four hues, adds $1,950 to the price of a base 2023 Range Rover.</p><p>At $4,550, the 12 available gloss-finish colors of SV Bespoke Ultra Metallic paint (British Racing Green, Ligurian Black, Flux Silver, Ethereal Frost, Velocity Blue, Constellation Blue, Ionian Silver, Sunset Gold, or Amethyst Grey gloss finish) are considerably more expensive but much brighter. Additionally, there are seven satin-finish versions of this SV Bespoke Ultra Metallic paint, which start at $7,450. The priciest paint of all is a special-effect satin-finish Icy White, which costs $12,050.</p><p>Notable option packages on the base 2022 Range Rover include the $2,000 Technology Pack, which includes a video rearview mirror and a head-up display, and the $2,000 Premium Upgrade Interior Pack, which features laminated front and rear side glass, illuminated tread plates, and the SV Bespoke Full Extended Leather Upgrade.</p><p>Also significant: The long-wheelbase 7-seat Range Rover Autobiography is available with deployable side steps ($4,600) and the Tailgate Event Suite with leather cushions. This $1,200 option lets you use the Range Rover's rear cargo space floor as an outward-facing seat for two, complemented by leather cushions, tailgate speakers, and lights.</p><p>The new SV also can be ordered with softer furniture-grade leather or, for the first time, a sustainable leather alternative that has the tactile qualities of leather but is 30% lighter and generates only a quarter of the CO2 in its production.</p><p>For $10,000, you can order the Westminster version of the outgoing Range Rover with the 518-horsepower V8. Next in the pecking order are the Autobiography models that build on the Westminster inventory with a more sophisticated version of the Terrain Response system, complemented by All Terrain Progress Control.</p><p>The SV Autobiography models all have the 557-horsepower V8 — that's the SV Autobiography Dynamic variants and the long-wheelbase SV Autobiography that tops the range. This ultimate Range Rover comes standard with 24-way power-adjustable front seats that are heated and ventilated, and have a “hot stone” massage function. A 1,700-watt Meridian audio system is also included, along with a couple of Executive Comfort Plus seats in the back.</p><p>Even at this heady level, there are more ways to plump up an SV Autobiography LWB. Such as with the fine Poltrona Frau quilted leather upholstery, 2-tone paint job ($14,300), power-retractable side steps, and the tailgate event seating.</p><p>Among the many other extra features that apply to several 2022 Range Rover models are things like perforated leather upholstery, different types of wood veneer, Activity Key, automatic high beams, fog lights, 22-inch alloy wheels, and a self-parking system.</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>For 2022, the all-new Range Rover engine lineup starts with a 395-horsepower turbocharged mild-hybrid inline-6 engine carried over from the current SUV. This combines a 3.0-liter 6-cylinder gasoline engine and an electric motor, which reclaims braking energy. The transmission is an 8-speed automatic.</p><p>Next up is a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine, also paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Supplied by BMW, the V8 kicks out 523 horsepower, sufficient for a sprightly 0-60 mph time of 4.4 seconds. It is the standard engine in the new Range Rover SE.</p><p>3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 mild-hybrid395 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm406 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-5,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/23 mpg</p><p>4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8523 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm553 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy (estimated): 15/21 mpg</p><p>There are essentially two drivetrains for the outgoing 2022 Range Rover. But each one splits into a couple of variations.</p><p>In the base version, a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 is augmented by a mild-hybrid system (MHEV). That extra hardware energizes the engine's fuel-conserving stop/restart function. In this form, it makes 355 horsepower.</p><p>The next-up Westminster has the same setup, but boosted to 395 horsepower. However, this trim is also offered with a 518-horsepower supercharged V8, which is standard in the Autobiography versions — both standard and long-wheelbase.</p><p>A supercharged V8 is amplified to 557 horsepower for the SV Autobiography Dynamic and long-wheelbase (LWB) models.</p><p>In every instance, an 8-speed automatic handles the transmission duties. All-wheel drive is standard, premium gasoline is recommended, and maximum towing capacity is 7,716 pounds.</p><p>Land Rover has discontinued the diesel and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) options this year. So the diesel is probably consigned to history. But the reason for the PHEV's nonappearance is apparently because of a shortage of components caused by the pandemic. So there's a chance it might become available again at some point.</p><p>3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 MHEV (base)355 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm365 lb-ft of torque @ 2,00-5,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/23 mpg</p><p>3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 MHEV (Westminster)395 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm406 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-5,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/23 mpg</p><p>5.0-liter supercharged V8 (Autobiography &amp; Westminster LWB)518 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm461 lb-ft of torque @ 2,500-5,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/21 mpg</p><p>5.0-liter supercharged V8 (Autobiography Dynamic &amp; SV Autobiography LWB)557 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm516 lb-ft of torque @ 3,500-5,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/19 mpg (SWB), 13/19 mpg (LWB)</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
