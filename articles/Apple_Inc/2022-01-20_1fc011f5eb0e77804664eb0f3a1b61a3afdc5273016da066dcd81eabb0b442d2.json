You're either aggressive or you're not aggressive,” Kuleba said. “We should not give Putin the slightest chance to play with quasi-aggression or small-incursion operations. This aggression was there since 2014. This is the fact.”</p><p>Ukraine, already unnerved by the presence of&#xa0;almost 100,000 Russian troops&#xa0;near its borders, was shaken by the comments from Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron Wednesday that raised questions about the West's&#xa0;unity and conviction in helping the country.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went on Twitter Thursday to “remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones.”</p><p>Biden, speaking at a White House event Thursday, didn't directly address the Ukrainian criticism but said he has been very clear with Putin about an invasion.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.</p><p>Trending at WSJ.com:</p><p>Beijing Winter Olympics: China's extreme COVID-19 rules to stop omicron</p><p>3G is shutting down.
