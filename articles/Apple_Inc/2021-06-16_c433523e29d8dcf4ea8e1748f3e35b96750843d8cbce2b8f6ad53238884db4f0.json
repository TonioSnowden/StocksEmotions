  "text": "<p>(Liveright, 399 pages, $28.95)</p><p>Hours before Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, SS leader Heinrich Himmler convened a perplexing meeting. He and his minions put aside preparations for the offensive to chitchat about a gay biochemist of Jewish descent in Berlin. Not to rage about the man, or plot his downfall -- to the contrary, the Nazis believed this scientist could save the Reich, by ridding it of a threat they feared every bit as much as Jews, homosexuals and communists -- the scourge of cancer.</p><p>That scientist, Otto Warburg, is the subject of \"Ravenous: Otto Warburg, the Nazis, and the Search for the Cancer-Diet Connection,\" an eye-opening work by journalist Sam Apple. Warburg (1883-1970) came from an aristocratic line of bankers, scholars and artists, and his physicist father knew Albert Einstein intimately. In fact, when Warburg insisted on joining a cavalry unit during World War I, Einstein coaxed him into resigning, by arguing that Warburg was far too brilliant to risk getting killed. Let some mediocre fellow die instead.</p><p>Einstein's appeal was shrewd, given Warburg's legendary vanity. \"Ravenous\" is filled with the outrageous and entertaining stories about Warburg's self-conceit. When he won the Nobel Prize in 1931, for work on how cells metabolize food and oxygen, his first response was, \"It's about time.\" On one occasion, Warburg summoned a scientist to Berlin to discuss his latest theory. \"I do not want your opinion,\" Warburg prefaced the invitation. \"I want an audience.\" When another colleague was asked to rank Warburg's arrogance from 1 to 10, the colleague paused for a moment before settling on 20.</p><p>There's no doubt Warburg was brilliant -- the greatest biochemist of his day -- and in the 1930s he focused on cancer, a major concern of the Nazis. Cancer deaths skyrocketed 287% in Germany between 1876 and 1910, \"making a quiet mockery of the extraordinary march of German science,\" Mr. Apple notes. From the Fuhrer down, Nazi leaders trembled at the disease, and they enacted surprisingly modern measures to fight cancer. They railed against cigarettes, encouraged women to examine their breasts for lumps and worked to eliminate pesticides and artificial preservatives in food.</p><p>In his lab, Warburg made seemingly fundamental discoveries about how cancer worked. The Nazis thus left him alone, and he thrived during the Third Reich. \"As the Nazis goose-stepped their way across Europe,\" Mr. Apple writes, \"rounding up and murdering Jews, Otto Warburg woke up every morning in an elegant, antique-filled home and rode horses with his male partner,\" while also summering near the Baltic Sea. Warburg even got away with insulting Nazi flunkies who visited his institute, kicking them out for \"spread[ing] unpleasant odors.\"</p><p>However defiant to individual Nazis he may have been, Warburg let himself be used as Nazi propaganda, when Nazi leaders began holding Warburg up as a shield against charges of human-rights abuse -- evidence, they claimed, that \"good\" Jews had it fine in the Reich. This is one of many cases documented in \"Ravenous\" in which Warburg's character suddenly flips from intriguing to repellent. The stress of living in Nazi Germany did take its toil on Warburg; one observer described him as teetering \"near the edge of mental instability.\" But however much he debated leaving, he never did. As Warburg once put it: it's \"easy to find a place for an ordinary person, but it is hard for a king to find a kingdom.\"</p><p>The second half of \"Ravenous\" shifts into the (somewhat tenuous) links between Warburg's research and our modern understanding of cancer. The biochemical complexities get a bit gnarly -- there's a dizzying amount of detail, making it hard to follow the main thread on occasion. Among other things, Warburg discovered that cancer cells gobble up far more glucose (a sugar) than their nonmalignant neighbors -- \"eating like shipwrecked sailors,\" Mr. Apple writes. Oddly, cancer cells also metabolize sugars through fermentation, in a manner analogous to yeast cells. Biochemically, fermentation is normally a backup power generator for human cells, used only when oxygen runs low. Warburg found that cancer cells were running the backup generator all the time.</p><p>From these discoveries, Warburg decided that the root cause of cancer lay in faulty cell metabolism -- especially problems producing power. Warburg began telling everyone who would listen that he'd solved cancer and, given his brilliance, many people assumed he had. Unfortunately, colleagues quickly discovered that Warburg's theories didn't hold water: There's a lot more to cancer than faulty power generation. Warburg, naturally, dismissed his critics as idiots. But the evidence against him kept piling up. And as genetics and molecular biology revolutionized cancer research in the 1960s, his stubborn focus on metabolism looked outdated.</p><p>As Mr. Apple explains, however, Warburg might get the last laugh, because recent studies have provided strong evidence that cancer thrives when our metabolisms spin out of control. Excess body fat -- caused by metabolic disorders -- contributes to 600,000 cases of cancer in the U.S. alone every year. Spikes of insulin -- caused by eating excess sugar -- are even worse, since insulin revs cancer cells up and causes them to reproduce like mad. To be sure, Mr. Apple notes, body fat and insulin cannot be the sole drivers of cancer. Cancer requires genetic mutations to get going, mutations that can arise from industrial chemicals, sunlight, radiation, viruses and other causes. Not all cancer cells thrive on insulin, either. But for those that do, Mr. Apple writes, \"the genetic transformation cannot be understood separately from the metabolic transformation.\"</p><p>Still, it's not clear how much credit Warburg deserves. I walked away from \"Ravenous\" thinking of Otto Warburg as a sort of Sigmund Freud of cancer research. Freud got One Big Thing right -- that the unconscious drives much of human behavior. But he was wrong on nearly every detail. Similarly, Warburg explicitly rejected good evidence for the insulin-cancer link during his lifetime, among other blunders, making it tricky to uphold him as a pioneer of modern cancer research.</p><p>Nevertheless, history will show that Otto Warburg always insisted that cancer was intimately tied to metabolism. As one latter-day biologist noted, marveling over Warburg's rehabilitation, \"We found out that son of a bitch was right.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Kean's latest book, \"The Icepick Surgeon: Murder, Fraud, Sabotage, Piracy, and Other Dastardly Deeds Perpetrated in the Name of Science,\" will be published in July.</p>",
