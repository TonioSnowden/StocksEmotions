The plan includes markdowns, canceling orders and removing inventory, along with price hikes to offset higher fuel and transportation costs, and supply chain adjustments such as increased holding capacity near U.S. ports.</p><p>Read: Retailers hit with 'double-whammy' as inventories rise, consumer sector stocks punished in May</p><p>Shares of Target were down 3.8% Tuesday afternoon and have dropped more than 40% from their 52-week high. Disappointing results from Target on May 18 sent stock indexes skidding, highlighting fears that surging inflation was beginning to cut into corporate earnings.</p><p>Several large retailers have delivered mixed earnings and outlooks in the latest quarterly reporting period, pressuring stock prices. Investors are trying to determine whether their results suggest the start of a potential recession, or just a shift in consumers spending to services from goods in the economic recovery from the pandemic.</p><p>See: Target's steps to reduce inventory glut are correct but are a few weeks late, analyst says</p><p>Choppy trade in the stock market also comes as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y hovers around 3%, a level that seems to make investors jittery.

Investors will be watching for potential signs that persistently high inflation may be easing.</p><p>\"I think we're on the backside of the pig passing through the python,\" said David Waddell, chief executive officer and chief investment strategist at Waddell &amp; Associates, in a phone interview Tuesday. Some \"price pressures are starting to cool,\" he said, adding that he expects the U.S. economy can achieve a \"soft landing\" as soaring inflation declines.</p><p>In a paper published Monday, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers argued there will be need forVolcker-style aggressiveness at the Federal Reserve to tame inflation. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates sharply to quell surging inflation, with the economy tipping into an early recession in the 1980s.</p><p>\"Many are interpreting this finding as implying that the task facing Powell is almost as severe as the task that faced Volcker, that a similar amount of hawkish restraint — relative to today's neutral policy setting — might be required to do so, and that this would almost certainly end in recession,\" said Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI. Guha said his opinion is that Powell's task is not as difficult as Volcker's in the 1980s.</p><p>Meanwhile, the World Banksharply downgraded its outlook for the global economy, pointing to Russia's war against Ukraine, the prospect of widespread food shortages and concerns about the potential return of \"stagflation\" — a toxic mix of high inflation and sluggish growth unseen for more than four decades.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>* Kohl's Corp.
