  "title": "Elon Musk thanks Apple CEO Tim Cook for campus tour, suggesting possible détente; Musk chafed at Apple's App Store policies earlier in the week",
  "text": "<p>The messaging was a departure from his more heated approach earlier in the week. On Monday, he tweeted that Apple had \"mostly stopped advertising on Twitter,\" and questioned whether those making decisions at Apple \"hate free speech in America.\"</p><p>He also suggested that Apple was censoring content, posted a poll asking whether people wanted Apple to \"publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers,\" said that Apple \"threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store\" without giving a reason, and griped about the cut that Apple takes of in-app purchases made through its devices.</p><p>Musk's public complaints sparked questions at the time about whether Apple would actually yank Twitter from the App Store, and whether Musk planned to dive even deeper into a battle with the largest public company in the U.S.</p><p>Opinion: Elon Musk's battle with Apple puts Twitter at greater risk</p><p>He would hardly be the first to take issue with Apple's take rate on in-app purchases. Epic Games, the maker of \"Fortnite,\" has gone to court arguing that the App Store violates antitrust laws. Match Group Inc. MTCH and Spotify Technology SA SPOT are among others that have voiced complaints.</p><p>See also: Spotify CEO joins Elon Musk in calling out Apple for 'shameless … bullying'</p><p>Given Musk's recent meeting with Cook and his more subdued tone in Wednesday's tweet, it's possible that Twitter's new owner will opt to work out his issues with Apple more privately going forward. But one can never really know with Musk, who isn't shy about waging public spats on a dime.</p><p>Elon Musk thanks Apple CEO Tim Cook for campus tour, suggesting possible détente</p>",
