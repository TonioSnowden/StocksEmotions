  "title": "Elizabeth Holmes Trial: Lab Director Raised Alarms About Faulty Tests; Dr. Adam Rosendorff testifies that company cared more about PR and money than patients",
  "text": "<p>\"I came to believe the company cared more about PR and fundraising than patient care,\" said Dr. Rosendorff.</p><p>His comments capped the third week of witness testimony in the criminal fraud trial of Ms. Holmes. He is the fourth former employee to take the witness stand as federal prosecutors build their case against Ms. Holmes, who is alleged to have defrauded patients and investors with claims that her blood-testing device could diagnose more than 200 health conditions using a few drops of blood from a finger prick.</p><p>Dr. Rosendorff testified that Ms. Holmes was aware the company's devices produced inaccurate results but pushed for Theranos to begin testing real patients. He said he left about a year and a half after joining after determining patient care wasn't the company's priority.</p><p>Ms. Holmes has pleaded not guilty to a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p><p>Upon taking the job, Dr. Rosendorff was inspired by what he called Ms. Holmes's earnest dedication to improve patient care. He said that while he didn't know much about the technology Theranos was building, he believed it would be innovative.</p><p>\"I thought it was going to be the next Apple,\" he said.</p><p>Dr. Rosendorff said his impressions changed soon after joining the startup. On Aug. 29, 2013, a little over a week before Theranos was set to launch its devices for patients to use, Dr. Rosendorff sent an email to Ms. Holmes detailing how even simple tests were returning results that were way off, according to a copy of an email that was displayed in court. He said he asked for more time to address the issues and to hire more staff and improve training. He also visited Ms. Holmes's office, where she had a paper posted to the window noting the number of days until the commercial launch.</p><p>\"She was very nervous,\" said Dr. Rosendorff. \"She was not her usual composed self.\" He described Ms. Holmes as trembling and her voice breaking.</p><p>In an email shown in court and dated Aug. 31, 2013, Ms. Holmes asked members of her staff how many tests had completed validation, a process required by federal regulatory guidelines before a test can be used for patient care. A staff scientist responded that none of the tests had completed validation. It was about nine days before Theranos was supposed to launch its devices for use on real patients, said Dr. Rosendorff.</p><p>Dr. Rosendorff reported to Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, the second-in-command and Ms. Holmes's ex-boyfriend. Dr. Rosendorff said Mr. Balwani often rebuffed his concerns or responded with hostility, so the lab director at times brought his concerns directly to Ms. Holmes because, as CEO, he thought she would be empowered to fix the problems. That didn't happen, he said.</p><p>Theranos's tests continued to provide inaccurate and at times highly implausible results. Dr. Rosendorff gave examples of tests for sodium and HDL, a cholesterol measurement, that were so far below the normal range for healthy individuals that he believed they were erroneous.</p><p>In certain tests, patients whose true results were higher than considered normal or healthy could show up as normal on Theranos's tests, Dr. Rosendorff said. Those patients wouldn't receive the treatment they needed, he said.</p><p>Theranos's hCG test, which measured a key hormone to indicate pregnancy and the normal progression of a pregnancy, also returned erratic results, Dr. Rosendorff said.</p><p>Write to Heather Somerville at Heather.Somerville@wsj.com</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes Trial: Lab Director Raised Alarms About Faulty Tests</p>",
