  "title": "Apple earnings show iPhone sales miss amid questions about smartphone demand; stock dips; Apple beats on earnings thanks to stronger-than-expected sales of Macs in the back-to-school quarter, but shares still decline after iPhone miss",
  "text": "<p>Apple generated $42.6 billion in iPhone sales during its latest quarter, up from $38.9 billion a year before, while analysts were projecting $43.0 billion.</p><p>The stock was down 1% to 4% in after-hours trading immediately following the release of the report Thursday.</p><p>As has been the case throughout the pandemic, Apple declined to offer a financial forecast in its release, so investors will need wait for the company's earnings call to get a sense for how things have fared since the September quarter ended and what expectations are like going into the holiday period.</p><p>A key question coming into Apple's report was how demand for the company's new iPhone 14 line has held up, especially given reports that the company has scaled back earlier production goals. While the company isn't likely to offer a traditional quantitative outlook on the call, executives could give some indication of how consumer behavior has played out recently amid the backdrop of economic pressure and more incremental upgrades within the newest family of iPhones.</p><p>For the latest quarter, Apple recorded net income of $20.7 billion, or $1.29 a share, compared with $20.6 billion, or $1.24 a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $1.27 a share in earnings.</p><p>Revenue performance across Apple's product lines was mixed. The company saw $11.5 billion in Mac revenue, up from $9.2 billion a year prior, along with $7.2 billion in iPad revenue, down from $8.3 billion. Analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling $9.3 billion for the Mac line and $7.8 billion in iPad revenue.</p><p>The company raked in $9.7 billion in revenue across its wearables, home and accessories category, up from $8.8 billion in the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $9.2 billion.</p><p>Services revenue climbed to $19.2 billion from $18.3 billion but fell short of the FactSet consensus, which was for $20.0 billion.</p><p>Shares of Apple have lost 18% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA — which counts Apple as one of its 30 components — has declined 12%.</p><p>Apple earnings show iPhone sales miss amid questions about smartphone demand; stock dips</p>",
