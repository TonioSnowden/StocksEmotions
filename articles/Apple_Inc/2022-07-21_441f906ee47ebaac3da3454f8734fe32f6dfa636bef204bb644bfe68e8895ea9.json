  "text": "<p>Watching the stylised horror movie <em>She Will</em>, you wonder what might have happened had director Charlotte Colbert made the recent adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f33597f7-5f24-465b-acdf-c2025853a356\"><em>Macbeth</em></a> with the millions backer Apple instead gave Joel Coen. Her tale of long pending revenge unfolds to striking effect in a Scotland of eerie pale blue mists and otherworldly forest. The film's star Alice Krige — once of the Royal Shakespeare Company — would make a mighty Lady Macbeth as well. But here in the present, her character Veronica Ghent is the wronged party, met en route to a Highland country house after a double mastectomy. </p> <p>Older wounds still linger too. “Tramadol — breakfast of movie stars,” she archly tells her nurse when handed the painkiller. And one of those she was — a child star from a 1960s cult favourite directed by a puffed-up auteur; now she is appalled when her solo retreat is double-booked by New Age dabblers. (Their number is led by Rupert Everett; the feted director is Malcolm McDowell. Make room for the acting!)</p> <p>The old dark house — in a thunderstorm, no less — is just one of Colbert's loaded visual elements. The heightened aesthetics keep you nicely off balance, even when the results feel outlandish. (A remote pub is done out in luxe purples, synth-pop classic “Goodbye Horses” playing in the bar.) But the heart of the film is the forest — the soil underfoot once holding the ashes of local women burnt after witch trials.</p> <p>If the script can be spotty, the movie excels when the focus falls on Krige and her imperious Veronica, a woman now settling scores with two poisoned histories: one of the Highlands, the other Hollywood.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>In UK cinemas from July 22</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2022 'She Will, film review — star turn from Alice Krige in stylised horror ' FT.com 21 July.
