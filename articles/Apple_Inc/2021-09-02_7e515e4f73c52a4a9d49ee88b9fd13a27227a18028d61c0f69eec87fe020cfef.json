  "title": "Business & Technology: Apple Watch Aims to Mine Health Data --- Blood-pressure measure, wrist thermometer are in works for device",
  "text": "<p>The company is expected to release its seventh version of the Apple Watch in the coming weeks, according to analysts, but most of its more ambitious health-related improvements aren't expected before 2022.</p><p>Beyond next year, Apple wants its smartwatch to be able to detect sleep apnea, provide medical guidance when it senses low blood oxygen levels and, perhaps one day, spot diabetes, according to the documents and some of the people.</p><p>Features, especially those being studied for release in later years, might never be rolled out to consumers or timing could change, cautioned people familiar with the company's plans.</p><p>The plans for the watch underscore Apple's ambitions in health, which Chief Executive Tim Cook has said will be the company's \"greatest contribution to mankind.\" Ads for the watch end with the tagline \"The future of health is on your wrist.\" Last year, the device brought in nearly $13 billion in sales, commanding 65% of the global smartwatch market by revenue, research firm Strategy Analytics estimates.</p><p>An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p>One challenge for Apple and other smartwatch makers is that the wrist is a poor place to measure vital signs like blood-sugar levels. Proving health features are safe and effective often takes years.</p><p>Apple's health division has faced challenges in its attempts to meet the company's big ambitions for disrupting healthcare. The unit's culture has been cited as a concern by some departing employees, The Wall Street Journal reported in June. Apple disputed assertions in that article and defended the accomplishments of its health team, saying the company is still in the early innings of its work in healthcare.</p><p>The watch's potential and its limits are evident in the new hypertension feature, according to people familiar with the feature and the documents. Apple previously set its sights on rolling out the feature next year, according to the people and documents.</p><p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, afflicts as many as 108 million American adults and is a factor in nearly half a million deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many don't know they have it.</p><p>Today, blood pressure is commonly measured with inflatable cuffs wrapped around the upper arm. The sensors in smartwatches and smartphones can't replicate that. So Apple is studying a proxy that measures the speed of the wave a heart beat sends through a person's arteries using sensors in the Apple Watch, according to the documents and the people.</p><p>Samsung Electronics Co. has incorporated a similar feature into smartwatches. Google's Fitbit unit has said it is also studying such a feature.</p><p>The version of the feature under discussion at Apple would try to show users how their blood pressure is trending, but without providing a baseline measure of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, according to people familiar with these plans. .</p><p>Other expected features next year would help the Apple Watch catch up with rivals, including detecting advanced sleep patterns at night, according to people familiar with the plans, similar to a feature available on the Fitbit.</p><p>In the future, Apple is investigating whether it can use the watch's blood-oxygen sensor to detect sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops and starts, lowering blood-oxygen levels and disrupting sleep, the people said. One challenge for Apple is determining when to take readings overnight since running the watch's sensor drains the battery, one of the people familiar with its plans said.</p>",
