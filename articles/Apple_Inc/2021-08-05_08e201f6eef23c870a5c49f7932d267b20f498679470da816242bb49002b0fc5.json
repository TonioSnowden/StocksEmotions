  "title": "Business News: Airlines Temper Their Optimism for Business Travel",
  "text": "<p>\"We're pivoting our capacity to now supplying more business seats,\" said Joe Esposito, Delta's senior vice president of network planning.</p><p>Delta has been polling corporate customers to ensure it gets the timing right. \"We don't want to put the seats in before they fly,\" Mr. Esposito said. \"We want to put the seats in when they're ready to get back in the air.\"</p><p>Vacation travel typically slows when summer ends, while business travelers start to hit the road again. How that shift plays out this year is a major test for airlines that rely heavily on lucrative corporate customers.</p><p>Southwest Airlines Co. and Alaska Air Group Inc. have sought to keep vacation traffic from falling off a cliff in September, with sales aimed at luring leisure travelers with deeply discounted tickets for this fall. Southwest, which is also restoring some business routes, has said its fare sale launched in June resulted in two of the biggest booking days in the company's history.</p><p>Overall, airlines as usual are planning more-muted schedules after summer, while also noting that their bookings haven't waned despite the growing concern about the more contagious Covid-19 variant.</p><p>But in one of the first signs that the new variant is starting to give travelers pause, budget carrier Frontier Airlines said Wednesday that its bookings had started to slow down more than they typically would at this time of year.</p><p>The airline said it believes this is \"directly related to the increased Covid-19 case numbers associated with the Delta variant.\"</p><p>The number of people passing through U.S. airports hit a fresh pandemic-era record on Sunday, with nearly 2.24 million people going through security, according to the Transportation Security Administration. The count was about 17% below 2019 levels.</p><p>Airlines have said that companies have slowly started sending employees on the road again, with domestic business travel climbing to about 40% of 2019 levels.</p><p>Carriers have been anticipating that more corporate customers would return in the coming months, though some airline executives have said a full rebound may still be a ways off.</p><p>The current upswing could end quickly if the pandemic worsens.</p><p>Vasu Raja, American Airlines Group Inc.'s chief revenue officer, said last month that there has been a lag of four to eight weeks between when employees return to offices and when business travel starts to pick up.</p><p>But companies such as Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have decided to postpone calling employees back in.</p><p>American Airlines is shifting service back toward business markets -- adding capacity on routes such as LaGuardia to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport amid signs that corporate travelers are returning.</p>",
