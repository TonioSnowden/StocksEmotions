  "text": "<p>Stocks have snapped back after swooning when the Omicron variant first emerged in late November. Investors have pointed to evidence that Omicron might cause less severe illness than previous variants, though scientists are still assessing its virulence and ability to evade vaccines.</p><p>\"The markets generally—if you look back in 2021—they have looked through any of the episodes of even partial lockdowns or that kind of risk,\" said Willem Sels, chief investment officer for private banking and wealth at HSBC. \"They assume vaccines would be effective or partially effective.\"</p><p>Mr. Sels expects more volatility. \"I think we're going to get a lot of flip-flopping,\" he said, pointing to an uncertain outlook for inflation and the potential for mixed economic data next year.</p><p>One reason some investors expect inflation to persist is the tight labor market. More evidence of hiring difficulties emerged with the Labor Department's latest U.S. job openings and labor-turnover survey, which indicated that job openings rose to 11 million in October. Economists had predicted 10 million unfilled positions. Meanwhile, 4.2 million workers quit their jobs in October.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.526% Wednesday from 1.479% Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve's meeting next week to find out if officials will tighten the pace of paring back asset purchases.</p><p>\"We've had a very, very good year. It's hard for the market to perhaps just keep this surge going given the uncertainty about the Fed next week,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled the potential for at least one interest rate increase in the first half of 2022.</p><p>Mr. Kelly, who believes the Fed will be forced to turn more hawkish in light of strong economic data, forecasts three rate hikes next year. He is recommending investors to hold European and Japanese equities, along with U.S. value stocks relative to a normal portfolio.</p><p>Vaccine makers diverged, with Moderna gaining 0.2% and Pfizer falling 0.9%. Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized Omicron in lab tests, but that a two-dose regimen was much less effective.</p><p>Apple shares are up 1.9%, pushing the company's market value to nearly $3 trillion. Stanley Black &amp; Decker rose 4.3% after the toolmaker said it would sell the bulk of its security-business assets to Securitas for $3.2 billion and buy back $4 billion in stock next year.</p><p>Global markets got a boost this week from Beijing's moves to stimulate the slowing Chinese economy. Investors remain on edge, however, about the Federal Reserve's plans to tighten monetary policy to tap the brakes on inflation in 2022.</p><p>In Hong Kong, China Evergrande Group shares skidded 5.5% to their lowest level since the embattled property company's initial public offering in 2009. Evergrande didn't make the payments due on some U.S. dollar bonds before a final deadline expired Monday, potentially setting the stage for a massive default. Hong Kong's broader Hang Seng Index edged up less than 0.1%.</p><p>Oil prices swung between small gains and losses. A weekly report from the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 241,000 barrels, a smaller decline than analysts estimated. Investors expect the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies could slow the pace of output growth in January. Benchmark U.S. crude futures gained 0.4% to $75.79 a barrel.</p><p>European natural-gas prices rose 5.1% after news reports that Nord Stream 2 could be shut down if Russia invades Ukraine. The controversial pipeline linking Russia and Germany had been expected to start operations in 2022, helping to ease Europe's gas shortage.</p><p>International stock markets were mixed. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index slipped 0.1%, led down by retail stocks. German food-delivery firm HelloFresh fell 7% after issuing earnings guidance for 2022 that fell short of analysts' expectations.</p><p>China's Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.2%, Japan's Nikkei 225 1.4% and India's BSE S&amp;P Sensex 1.8%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at Joe.Wallace@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Mixed as Dow Dips, Nasdaq Rises</p>",
