  "text": "<p>Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its best three-week stretch since November 2020, offering investors a reprieve from the selling pressure that has whipsawed portfolios this year. The rally was kicked off, in part, by a batch of corporate earnings—particularly from banks and airlines—that offered an encouraging outlook on the U.S. economy. Stocks then raced higher on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that Federal Reserve officials are likely to consider the possibility of shifting to smaller interest-rate increases in December.</p><p>Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds declined after the report and continued to slide Monday. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 4.160%, from 4.212% Friday. The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to interest-rate expectations, fell to 4.458%, from 4.489%.</p><p>Rising rates have squeezed stocks this year, and Monday's decline in yields helped give futures a boost and shake off jitters that came after asharp selloffin Hong Kong shares. The Hang Seng Index tumbled 6.4% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since the global financial crisis, after Chinese leader Xi Jinping cemented his control over the ruling Communist Party by securing a third term and appointing a number of loyalists to the party's most powerful decision-making body.</p><p>U.S. stock futures fell earlier in the session as the selloff in Hong Kong weighed on global sentiment, before eventually reversing their losses and turning positive.</p><p>\"There is concern about the direction of U.S.-Chinese relations, and I think that will continue to ripple through the market,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But, she added, \"As far as Wall Street is concerned, it's still fixated on what the Fed is doing.\"</p><p>Investors also remain on edge about what is expected to be a busy week of earnings reports. Despite some early reports that have shown signs of optimism, fewer companies than usual are beating Wall Street's earnings expectations. Traders this week will parse reports from blue-chip companies including Coca-Cola and Boeing, in addition to megacap technology companies including Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>In premarket trading, U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies tumbled, with Alibaba's American depositary receipts losing 12% and those for Baidu losing 13%.</p><p>Tesla's shares lost 2.2% after the company lowered prices for vehicles sold in China, the world's biggest electric-vehicle market. Prices for the Tesla's popular Models Y and 3 sold in China have been cut by as much as 9.4%, according to a social-media post by the company Monday.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.5%. On Monday, a closely watched survey from S&amp;P Global showed that a continuing economic contraction in the eurozone intensified in October, with the rate of decline hitting the fastest since April 2013, excluding Covid-19 lockdowns.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the U.K., stocks rose. The FTSE 250 of more domestically oriented stocks gained 1.2% after Boris Johnson pulled out of the race for prime minister, leaving Rishi Sunak, the U.K.'s former Treasury chief, as the favorite for the job. U.K. government bond prices rallied, sending yields lower. The yield on the U.K.'s 10-year gilt fell to 3.817%, from 4.052% Friday.</p><p>The British pound ticked up slightly to $1.1317 from $1.1304 late Friday. Meanwhile, the dollar climbed, with the WSJ Dollar Index rising 0.4%.</p><p>In Asia, China's CSI 300 dropped 2.9% and the Shanghai Composite fell 2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 bucked the trend, rising 0.3% amid a possible yen-buying intervention by the Japanese government.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise to Kick Off Busy Earnings Week</p>",
