  "text": "<p>It took coronavirus for Uli Jordan to feel at home in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/538e73da-ff33-11e6-8d8e-a5e3738f9ae4\">Whistler</a>. The 60-year-old German entrepreneur has owned a home there since 2003. But stranded at the Canadian ski resort for nearly six months last year — thanks to a combination of illness and Covid-related flight disruptions — he and his wife found themselves getting to know people properly.</p> <p>Many, he discovered, had arrived from Vancouver when the pandemic hit, converting second homes bought for skiing or summer trips into their main homes. On his next visit — arriving from Cologne in January for the ski season — he knew they would be around. “You just grab your phone and you know you will have friends around. [It] made it more of a home.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Whistler has long been a favoured destination for spring skiing. Average March snowfall is 2.7 metres, compared with roughly 1 metre in Vail in the US or Courchevel in France.&#xa0;In a normal year, the resort would be gearing up to host the World Ski and Snowboard Festival, which since 1996 has become a key competition event every April for many of the world's best skiers and snowboarders. </p> <p>While the Whistler Blackcomb resort — which encompasses Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb peak — is open,&#xa0;provincewide guidelines currently advise against all non-essential travel in British Columbia and, this year, a pared down digital version is planned.</p> <p>Although the town will not be welcoming hundreds of thousands of festivalgoers this spring, the local property market has experienced&#xa0;a burst of activity since the pandemic struck.</p> <p>Despite the Whistler Blackcomb resort closing from March to June last year, C$1.1bn (US$866m) worth of homes were sold in the area in 2020, up from C$686m the year before, according to Whistler Listings System. Houses and chalets made up a much larger share than previous years (the total number of flats sold in 2020 actually fell compared with a year earlier), with affluent buyers from Vancouver seeking large homes in which to weather lockdown, according to local agents.&#xa0;</p> <p>In addition to the largely pedestrianised Whistler Village, the wider area comprises a number of spots scattered along Highway 99, including Function Junction, Cheakamus Crossing, Blackcomb Benchlands and Creekside.</p> <p>Many of the area's larger and more expensive homes are to be found a short drive from the lifts in Whistler and Whistler Creek; and new community developments, such as WedgeWoods — a combination of completed homes and vacant plots in landscaped grounds with amenities including tennis courts and a day care centre — are increasingly popular. </p> <p>Whistler buyers tend to place less emphasis on the ski-in-ski-out homes favoured in Europe, with most happy to drive to the slopes, says Maggi Thornhill, a local estate agent with Engel &amp; Völkers. Sales of homes over C$5m increased from 13 in 2019 to 33 in 2020.</p> <p>Prices are competitive by international standards and the snow is reliable. According to Savills, the average cost of a property here is equivalent to €9,300 per sq m, a fraction of the priciest North American resort Aspen, at €22,100 per sq m. Despite being the 29th most expensive resort tracked by Savills, Whistler is the 19th most “resilient”, factoring in snowfall and season length — Whistler's runs from November to May.</p> <p>While Whistler's sales market rode the wave of growing demand created by coronavirus, 2020 was a tougher year for renters facing high rents and falling incomes. Jen Biberdorf, 42, lost her job in a local childcare business after three years last spring, and has been relying on payments from the federal emergency Covid relief plan. </p> <p>She moved from her hard-won C$1,350 studio in Whistler — “so rare, it was like finding a diamond in the rough” — to Pemberton, 20 miles north, where for C$1,000 a month she rents a room in a two-bedroom apartment.</p> <p>Housing affordability has long been a challenge for local workers like Biberdorf, more than half of whom rent, according to local government figures. With three out of four local homes owned by second homers, rising sale prices have had a knock-on effect on rents (there is no central rental price database in Whistler). </p> <p>Despite a 2017 bylaw designed to clamp down on illegal short-term rentals, locals say it still occurred before the pandemic hit.</p> <p>For Jordan and his wife, meanwhile, the experience of last year has cemented their connection with Whistler. “[In 2020] we were all of us stuck here. Nobody was able or willing to move back home. Our relationship with Whistler has changed and become deeper. The use [of our house] didn't change but it has made it more of a home.”</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
