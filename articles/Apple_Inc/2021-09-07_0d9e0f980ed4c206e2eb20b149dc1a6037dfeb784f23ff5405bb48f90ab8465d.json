  "text": "<p>Any list of the most outstanding British business leaders of all time would have to place Josiah Wedgwood at or close to the top. A scientist and a restless innovator, he was the driving force behind the global success of the country's ceramics industry in the second half of the 18th century. He developed new and vastly more sophisticated manufacturing techniques, and he was the first to understand the power of consumer advertising and marketing.</p> <p>He was active in the public realm — a leader in the development of England's road and canal systems, and a champion of the abolitionist movement at a time when many of his peers still regarded slavery as a necessary part of the economy. And he was a member of the Lunar Society, an extraordinary group of brilliant and practical Midlands men who met near the full moon, so that they could ride home safely after dark, and performed experiments, read papers and debated new ideas about science.</p> <p>Above all, he was endlessly curious and hugely ambitious. Even at the height of his success, he continued to spend hour after hour in his laboratory, working with kilns, glazes and clays in the search for new materials. And his dreams were bold. Writing to his business partner about jasperware, the stoneware rival to porcelain that was one of his many innovations, he said his goal was nothing less than to “astonish the world all at once, for I hate piddling you know”.</p> <p>Wedgwood's remarkable story has been told in many biographies over the years. The great contribution of <em>The Radical Potter</em>, Tristram Hunt's new book, is to place him in the context of the rapid economic and social changes during his lifetime that helped make his success possible. His genius emerged at a time when an increasing population and expanding economy meant growing numbers of households were generating incomes that catered for more than their immediate needs. For the first time they could start to think about wider ranges of consumer goods and services. As the craze for tea drinking spread, so did the wish for something better than cheap earthenware to serve it in.</p> <p>Expanding consumer demand, new sources of energy, the growth of specialist trades that greatly improved workplace productivity — all this helped to turn North Staffordshire into a great manufacturing centre. Then there was the rise in global trade, with sea lanes protected by the Royal Navy. </p> <p>In return for suitable gifts, British ambassadors and their wives around the world proved more than willing to make a “proper and noble introduction” of Wedgwood products to elite overseas circles. By the 1780s, foreign sales accounted for 80 per cent of the company's production, giving it a dominant position in North America and a strong presence right across continental Europe.</p> <p>Encouraged by the British ambassador to Russia, Empress Catherine the Great placed the largest order the company ever received: a service of 944 pieces, each decorated with a green frog and views of the English countryside. The production costs were cripplingly high, but Wedgwood made sure that the whole of polite society knew about the support of his royal patron. An advertisement on page one of the Public Advertiser in June 1774 invited the public, by ticketed entry only, to see the celebrated Frog Service on display in Greek Street in Soho before it was packed off to St Petersburg: anybody who was anybody duly turned up.</p> <p>Hunt suggests that Wedgwood was a defining figure of his age in a similar way, perhaps, to Steve Jobs in the 21st century digital era. It's true that both men had in common interdisciplinary thinking, aesthetic control, production oversight and a relentlessly experimental frame of mind. But Wedgwood was much more than that. In the words of William Gladstone, the great Liberal prime minister of the 19th century, Wedgwood was “the greatest man who ever, in any age or country, applied himself to the important work of uniting art with industry”.</p> <p>Wedgwood as a business was still flourishing well into the 1980s, but what happened thereafter brings a sad epilogue to the book. Under pressure from the City, the company merged with Waterford Crystal, and Tony O'Reilly, the Irish tycoon, acquired control. Although he sank large amounts of his personal fortune into the enterprise, it failed to adapt to changing consumer tastes and to the new markets for luxury products that were developing in Asia. The final mistake was an attempt to cut costs by shifting production offshore to Indonesia, with damaging consequences for a brand that was in part built on being “Made in England”.</p> <p>Hunt was from 2010 to 2017 the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, the constituency at the heart of the potteries industry, and he blames incompetent management for the collapse of the company in 2009. He argues that the company was not the victim of unexplained market forces, rather “it was destroyed by a sustained disavowal of Josiah Wedgwood's precepts for success”. </p> <p>That judgment may seem harsh. But as the company itself explained in its 1787 catalogue: “A competition for cheapness, and not for excellence of workmanship, is the most frequent and certain cause of the rapid decay and entire destruction of arts and manufactures.”</p> <p>The failure to recognise this basic truth lies behind the disappearance not just of Wedgwood, but also of large swaths of British manufacturing industry over the past 50 years.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241287898/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0241287898&amp;linkId=ad3c00fcd50cf8c487629d3822c93a7b\"><strong>The Radical Potter</strong></a><strong>: Josiah Wedgwood and the Transformation of Britain</strong> by Tristram Hunt, <em>Allen Lane £25, 352 pages</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Richard_Lambert\"><em>Richard Lambert</em></a><em> is chair of the British Museum and a former editor of the FT</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Richard Lambert 2021 'The Radical Potter by Tristram Hunt — creating the mould' FT.com 7 September.
