  "title": "Shanghai Battles Covid-19 Outbreaks in Another Elderly-Care Hospital; The city has yet to acknowledge outbreaks in two major facilities for the elderly. 'The hospital hasn't been forthcoming,' says the granddaughter of a 95-year-old patient",
  "text": "<p>On Thursday, the Journal reported that at least 100 patients had tested positive for Covid-19 and many patients died at Donghai Elderly Care Hospital, the city's biggest elderly-care facility by capacity, according to orderlies brought in recently to fill in for workers sent away to quarantine and other people familiar with the situation.</p><p>Shanghai's government hasn't reported any Covid outbreak at either Donghai Hospital or Tongkang Hospital. Nor has it reported any Covid-related death at any of its hundreds of elderly-care centers.</p><p>The city government didn't respond to a request for comment. Calls to both hospitals weren't returned.</p><p>The outbreaks in a city with 820,000 people aged above 80 occurred as public-health experts have warned about the danger Omicron poses to China's elderly population, with barely half of people in that age group having had two or more doses of vaccine. Low vaccination numbers among the elderly contributed to record death rates in Hong Kong, where outbreaks have plagued nursing homes in recent months.</p><p>Tongkang Hospital, a privately owned facility, is located in the western part of the city, which went into a lockdown on Friday. It can accommodate more than 1,000 patients, it said on an official WeChat account. Donghai, a public hospital, has around 1,800 beds. Both hospitals are generally full. Shanghai also has hundreds of smaller nursing homes.</p><p>A Shanghai woman said after a visitor ban at the Tongkang hospital since February, she had been keeping in touch with her 95-year-old grandmother, a patient at the hospital, via an iPad she had given her. She said her grandmother wasn't vaccinated against Covid.</p><p>This weekend, the woman said, she noticed in video chats that hospital orderlies had started to wear full protection gear. She didn't think too much of it but then by midweek, she learned from medical workers that both patients and workers had begun being transferred to a separate building, one after the other.</p><p>By Friday, her grandmother had become one of the patients quarantined with a heavy cough after she tested positive. Medical workers told her that five women of similar age, who had been in the same room had a fever, although their Covid tests came back negative.</p><p>She said she had tried to get an explanation for why parts of the hospital were sealed off. \"The hospital has not been forthcoming,\" she said.</p><p>At least one patient died in the past week at Tongkang Hospital, according to a messenger-app chat record among relatives of patients reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. In the exchanges, relatives urged nurses to take video of the patients under quarantine, and begged for phone numbers of newly assigned orderlies so that they could talk to their relatives.</p><p>It couldn't be determined whether the death was related to Covid.</p><p>Zhang Aizhen, an orderly who has worked in Donghai Hospital for more than a decade, said dozens of orderlies, nurses and doctors had been infected, including herself, and transferred to a makeshift quarantine center in a stadium.</p><p>On Wednesday, after relatives looked for help in locating Donghai Hospital patients who had been transferred to other hospitals for quarantine, the hospital set up a hotline for family members to inquire about patients' status.</p><p>The next day, as replacement orderlies went on strike, fearful of their exposure to the virus, the officials sent out an emergency request asking all available employees to return, according to a notice verified by the Journal. A doctor at Donghai Hospital said the remaining medical workers were overloaded, with some assistance from experts sent in by the local health authorities.</p><p>At a press conference on Friday, a National Health Commission official said the government would arrange more vaccinations for its senior citizens. In Beijing, one neighborhood is offering an amount equivalent to $63 for those aged above 60 as an incentive to take the first shot.</p><p>Donghai Hospital said on its official WeChat account that all of its more than 700 employees were fully vaccinated, with booster shots given five months ago. The post didn't mention vaccination rates of patients. Donghai hasn't arranged vaccination for all patients, said relatives of two patients.</p><p>Tongkang was already on alert for an outbreak. Visits became restricted last summer and were totally banned in February, when Omicron started to spread in other Chinese cities. Meanwhile, medical workers from the hospital aided the city's Covid prevention campaign in mid-March, conducting PCR tests at 120 sites.</p><p>Shanghai Battles Covid-19 Outbreaks in Another Elderly-Care Hospital</p>",
