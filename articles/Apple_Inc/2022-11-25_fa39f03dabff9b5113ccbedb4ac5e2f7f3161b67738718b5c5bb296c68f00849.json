The outlook has improved thanks to government support, lower gas prices and a mild autumn. Business confidence has also rebounded after fears receded of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eede120-9b49-4225-86c5-5f3ac5b56546#post-5019ad2b-cefb-416a-ab9a-bf513f963710\">winter energy shortages</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>The UK has limited use of Chinese-made <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abdc8265-7188-4d59-ab62-596416bc76cb\">surveillance systems</a> on government sites, citing security risks. Our latest Big Read examines America's ban on Chinese semiconductors, the move will hurt China's chipmakers but add <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3935b9a-a203-435d-b1a9-a22bcc9d79e7\">inflationary pressures</a> on many products.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Good evening,</p> <p>It's Black Friday, which means Cyber Monday, Christmas gift buying and the January sales are all around the corner. Today, the US holiday shopping season gets under way at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cf176bf-2d15-4d38-b46a-27a5260c1f0c\">a pivotal time for consumers</a> faced with the steepest rise in prices since the early 1980s.</p> <p>Big names such as Macy's and Walmart are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02ab11d2-707f-4c49-930d-1a362ad05345\">hiring far fewer holiday workers</a> than last year, as is FedEx, which expects to handle fewer packages. The National Retail Federation has forecast a spending slowdown, in contrast with 2021 when consumers were flush with savings accumulated during the pandemic lockdowns. </p> <p>However, most retailers remain cautiously optimistic, even as they face their first <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce51ac1b-c694-4460-8aae-3ae4dc87ad49\">real-terms fall in revenues</a> since the global financial crisis, once inflation is stripped from calculations.</p> <p>Recent earnings statements offered mixed messages. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5a08960-7af5-4759-a714-d6bb98bd9f4e\">Target</a> cut its holiday forecast after a big drop in third-quarter profits as “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5a08960-7af5-4759-a714-d6bb98bd9f4e\">spending patterns changed dramatically</a>”.&#xa0; Chief executive Brian Cornell said: “[Customers] are feeling increasing levels of stress, driven by persistently high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and an elevated sense of uncertainty about their economic prospects.”</p> <p>Rival Walmart, on the other hand, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/602c768e-bf8f-4f9c-bd00-ff0d91bf9491\">much more bullish</a>. The world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, known for its appeal to cash-strapped families, raised its full-year forecast, citing richer customers trading down as one of the reasons for a successful third quarter. </p> <p>Bargain hunting is likely to play an even more important role than usual this year, with online discounts forecast to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ba55444-f616-4722-9808-954de7c6dc03#post-97cfab82-06c6-41cc-bc25-fe84b41ef76b\">hit a record level</a>. At the other end of the market, New York has now overtaken Hong Kong as home to the most expensive spot for<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1b600fa-fe0a-466d-9ec4-59ad62eea59a\"> luxury shopping</a>.</p> <p>Designer label goods are normally a staple fare on China's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4686280-b6a7-4569-848a-b410d0d04cc9\">Singles Day</a>, the world's biggest retail event and a bellwether for the consumer market. But this year's event on November 11 failed to lift the economic gloom from continued pandemic lockdowns and a government crackdown on excess.</p> <p>In the UK, retail analysts are more focused on how the grocery sector will fare over the holiday period and specifically on whether the Big Four supermarket chains — Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Wm Morrison — that have dominated food retail for 15 years can fend off the challenge of Germany's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2bb1e80-8eba-44f4-83a8-e6adae5ded87\">Lidl and Aldi</a>. </p> <p>FT columnist Cat Rutter Pooley draws a parallel with the airline industry. “Ryanair and easyJet once catered to a no-frills niche. Their budget offer is now the norm around which the likes of British Airways have had to reorient, fundamentally altering their profitability and prospects,” she argues.</p> <p>The discounters are hoping to pick up market share as the squeeze on consumer budgets tightens. Kantar last month calculated <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a91a3c9-edc9-4241-aa07-cf55712057c7\">UK grocery inflation</a> had hit almost 14 per cent or an extra £643 a year for shoppers.</p> <p>UK supermarkets and butchers also face a new seasonal problem: the country's worst ever bird flu outbreak has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/840f56af-0ddf-4226-ae38-41ac2a288f8a\">wrecked the supply of turkeys</a>.</p> <h1>Need to know: UK and Europe economy</h1> <p>UK prime minister <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> is under pressure from business, legal, worker and environmental groups to drop plans to automatically <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b894b195-6adc-48eb-80c3-efe7f818d452\">strip EU-derived laws</a> from Britain's statute book by the end of next year.</p> <p>France's energy minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher said the <strong>European energy market</strong> needed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/570446b2-2cd5-4153-9890-29b7caa076b9\">“structural” reform</a> if EU industry was to survive the current crisis. Vitol, the world's largest independent energy trader, said the energy crisis would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c0b645f-2507-4b85-8c15-9b660adad324\">linger for years</a>.</p> <p><strong>Spain</strong> is pushing on with its plan for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6988ef5b-21b6-4443-b603-d4ee4be57048\">€7bn in windfall taxes</a> on banks and energy companies.</p> <p>Household net wealth <strong>in Ireland</strong> is at a record high, thanks to house prices.

A <strong>Bank of England</strong> deputy governor said tax rises and spending cuts were unlikely to persuade the BoE to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8981df2f-f723-4a1a-8044-0e7a3e4856a0\">moderate future rate rises</a>, while a <strong>European Central Bank</strong> policymaker said it would be difficult to raise rates <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d97c6016-c6a0-443b-a08d-5bdcc448bd73\">in smaller increments</a> because government help on energy prices would keep inflation higher for longer. </p> <p>Brad DeLong from the University of California, Berkeley argues in our latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c06f107-d026-425f-92ff-4c9a89249662\">Economists Exchange</a> that the US is now an “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/791fe484-595f-44f9-86e7-55bdbbbd22e8\">anti-globalisation outlier</a>” and no longer seen as a place where the future is forged.</p> <p>China's <strong>zero-Covid</strong> exit plans unravelled as new infections multiplied across the country, with <a href=\"https://spark.ft.com/editor/929b69b4-7826-429d-9e1f-f178845fac8b\">vaccination rates still low</a> among the elderly and a vulnerable healthcare system.

US private equity firm Silver Lake has consolidated its position as the second-largest shareholder in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d07d4408-a448-4ed8-9083-2aeb0396d2ba\">Manchester City's</a> parent company, while David Beckham is reportedly “open to talks” about becoming involved in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f13c52f6-57c1-4bf8-9dd9-289beec901b1\">buying Manchester United</a>.</p> <p><strong>Twitter </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9fdace4-5eb2-4db2-929b-e34861fa0521\">disbanded its entire Brussels office</a>, raising more concerns about its adherence to EU rules on disinformation and hate speech.
