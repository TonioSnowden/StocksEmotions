  "text": "<p>   Apple Inc. is forging a partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to offer high-yield savings accounts to users of Apple's credit card, the Apple Card, marking the tech company's latest move into the financial-services space. </p><p>   Apple Card users would be able to set up and manage the savings accounts directly in the Wallet app on their iPhones, Apple said. The savings accounts are expected to roll out in the coming months, the company said. </p><p>   Once users set up their savings account through the Apple Card, future rewards from the card, called Daily Cash, can be deposited automatically into the savings account, Apple said. Users also can add their Daily Cash rewards to an Apple Cash card, which is a digital card in the wallet app that lets users send and receive money, the company said. Users can change the destination for their Daily Cash rewards at any time. </p><p>   Users would also be able to deposit funds into the savings accounts through a linked bank account, Apple said, and funds can be withdrawn at any time. </p><p></p>",
