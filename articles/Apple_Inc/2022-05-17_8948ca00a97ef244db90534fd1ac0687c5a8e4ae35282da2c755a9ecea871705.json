  "title": "Cash-Rich Companies Urged to Push Banks to Act on Climate; Advocacy groups say tech giants and other companies with big cash reserves should use leverage with lenders to raise their environmental ambitions",
  "text": "<p>The Climate Safe Lending Network, the Outdoor Policy Outfit and BankFWD argued that the cash and investments on companies' balance sheets enable the banks looking after that money to lend moreâ€”including financing for fossil-fuel production.</p><p>The report focused on technology companies with sizable cash reserves that have publicized efforts to cut emissions. Working with climate services company South Pole, the advocacy groups estimated that cash and investments would be the biggest source of emissions for Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. if they included them in their latest carbon accounts. Apple Inc.'s emissions would be 64% higher with these emissions included, while Amazon.com Inc., which with its delivery business generates more greenhouse gases directly, would have had an 11% larger carbon footprint, according to the researchers' estimates.</p><p>Between them, those companies had nearly $120 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of this year, not including other investments.</p><p>\"Companies' climate accomplishments are being undermined by a misaligned financial system that is channeling hundreds of billions of corporate U.S. dollars into the carbon-intensive sectors driving the climate crisis,\" the report says. \"Companies have the power to significantly shift this trajectory and proactively engage with the financial sector to help steer the world toward a path of rapid climate progress.\"</p><p>A representative of Alphabet's Google said the company would scrutinize the report's methodology as part of efforts to determine how it could bring down emissions from its value chain. Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple didn't comment.</p><p>The researchers laid out ways in which cash-rich companies could put pressure on banks, such as helping them develop climate-benefiting financial products or even committing to move their business to rivals that are phasing out fossil-fuel lending.</p><p>The risk of losing an important source of business would be a spur to action for financial institutions, said James Vaccaro, executive director of the Climate Safe Lending Network. For a bank, \"you're going to have to listen to those customers,\" he said. At the same time, he argued that banks that move quickly to cater to climate-conscious companies could profit. \"There's a huge bonus for them if they can align with these companies,\" he said.</p><p>Many companies are already nudging suppliers and customers to shrink their carbon footprints. Expanding that to their financial arrangements could leave banks facing choices about which sectors to serve at a time when energy companies are enjoying bumper profits and attracting investor attention.</p><p>Many banks say they want to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, but they are largely maintaining support for oil and gas. The 60 largest global banks provided $741.8 billion of fossil-fuel financing last year, down just over 1% from 2020, according to the nonprofit Rainforest Action Network.</p><p>Mr. Vaccaro said the climate impact of big companies' cash \"has been hiding in plain sight,\" partly because there hasn't been an established way of calculating it.</p><p>Related</p><p>* Climate-Reporting Rules Could Let Companies Look Greener Than They Are</p><p>* Scope 3 Rules Hinder Progress on Emissions, Researchers Say</p><p>Companies don't disclose all the details of their banking relationships, and most banks don't publish comprehensive calculations of the carbon footprint of their financing. Consequently, instead of doing a ground-up calculation based on companies' specific arrangements, the researchers relied on estimates of the carbon intensity of different financial-market activities, looking at how financing breaks down by factors such as sector and geography. They built on a technique used by two other nonprofit groups, the Sierra Club and the Center for American Progress, to estimate U.S. lenders' emissions last year.</p><p>Patrick Flynn, sustainability chief of software company Salesforce Inc., said the reliance on industry-average emissions data is a drawback of this approach. But he added that \"in that shortcoming there's power,\" because a bank that is moving faster than its peers on climate would have an incentive to refine its own data.</p><p>The report estimated that the $10.5 billion of cash and marketable securities on Salesforce's balance sheet as of January 2022 generated emissions equivalent to 993,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or 91% of its reported emissions. Mr. Flynn said Salesforce would review the findings and consider the implications for the way emissions are disclosed.</p><p>The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a coalition of environmental groups and businesses that sets guidelines for emissions accounting, lists investments as a reporting category in its guidance for Scope 3 emissions but says the category is \"primarily for private financial institutions.\" The group, which is reviewing the standard, plans to update that part so it clearly encompasses nonfinancial companies whose cash makes a material emissions impact, according to Pankaj Bhatia, director of GHG Protocol at the World Resources Institute. He said the guidance will lay out how these emissions could be calculated but didn't comment on the methodology of the Climate Safe Lending Network and its partners.</p><p>The guidelines \"should be more explicit,\" Mr. Bhatia said. \"There are many companies that are not in the financial sector that have a huge amount of cash.\"</p><p>Write to Ed Ballard at ed.ballard@wsj.com</p><p>Cash-Rich Companies Urged to Push Banks to Act on Climate</p>",
