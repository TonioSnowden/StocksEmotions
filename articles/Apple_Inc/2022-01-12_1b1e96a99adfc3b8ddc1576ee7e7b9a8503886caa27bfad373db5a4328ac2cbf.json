  "text": "<h2>The market maker aiming to become a hot stock</h2> <p><strong>Ken Griffin</strong> made billions of dollars executing the day trades of Gen Z and millennial speculators during the pandemic. Now he's preparing to make billions more by selling them a piece of his market-making outfit, <strong>Citadel Securities</strong>.</p> <p>The Chicago-based trading billionaire with a taste for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e46b886-1ca2-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65\">trophy real estate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c38b7579-bbba-4a79-b8df-e6dd13c5aa2a\">rare historical documents</a> is priming his market-making outfit to be one of the biggest Wall Street listings since the flotations of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> in 1999 and <strong>Blackstone Group</strong> in 2007.</p> <p>Citadel Securities yesterday announced it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/188afc27-5c08-4b06-b066-d79522ed787e\">sold a $1.2bn stake</a> to venture capital firms <strong>Sequoia </strong>and <strong>Paradigm </strong>— the latter of which specialises in cryptocurrencies and token-based apps (sometimes referred to as Web3) — at a $22bn valuation. Sources say it will pave the way for an initial public offering of the business that could be one of the biggest Wall Street listings on record.</p> <p>If it were to price its offering at a premium to the private funding round, Citadel Securities could approach the $30bn valuations both Goldman and Blackstone fetched during their own IPOs.</p> <p>Griffin's trading outfit has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25e6100d-4cdd-45d0-aaab-6f9b77b14257\">made more money</a> from the retail trading boom than any other firm on Wall Street by paying various brokerages for the right to handle orders and providing the financial muscle behind the controversial “payment for order flow” model that makes trading on platforms such as <strong>Robinhood</strong> and <strong>Charles Schwab</strong> commission-free.</p> <p>Citadel Securities' revenues more than doubled in 2020 to more than $6bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/citadel-securities-reaps-record-6-7-billion-year-on-volatility?sref=OziMsGoK\">report</a> from Bloomberg. The firm's ebitda margins are often above 50 per cent, a source told the FT.</p> <p>And at the start of 2021, Citadel Securities set new record trading volumes as day traders launched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/173efc91-8124-4b06-88ab-66f1d882a707\">meme stocks</a> such as <strong>GameStop</strong> and <strong>AMC Entertainment</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66fa243d-347b-4dd0-bfb9-57097795c34c\">into orbit</a>.</p> <p>The speculative trading bonanza may now be on life support, making it a good time for Griffin to consider his options. </p> <p>Revenues in smaller publicly traded competitor <strong>Virtu Financial</strong>, which has a market cap of nearly $6bn, dropped 17 per cent in the third quarter. A brutal sell-off in technology stocks to start 2022 may deepen the slump.</p> <p>With venture backers Sequoia and Paradigm, Griffin is trying to bolster Citadel's presence in cryptocurrencies, sources said. It's something of an about-face just months after Griffin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9b5189-0b0e-4b83-a2e7-533f3ac85733\">described </a>cryptocurrencies as “a jihadist call that ‘we don't believe in the dollar'”.</p> <p>As shares in GameStop and AMC lose steam, DD can understand why Citadel might now be drawn to crypto, a market often containing even wider spreads and greater speculative activity than meme stonks.</p> <h2>Google heads up the Big Tech crusade in Brussels</h2> <p>Regulators in Brussels are coming up with new tools to tackle the ever growing power of Big Tech.</p> <p>For too long, many in the EU believe, tech behemoths such as <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong> have been operating without a rule book — engaging in anti-competitive behaviour, cornering markets and buying rivals to eliminate competition.</p> <p><strong>Google</strong>, in particular, is worried about the mood changing. After all, the search giant recently lost a major case before the EU court and it has been designated a “gatekeeper” by the German antitrust watchdog, meaning it will have to comply with more stringent rules.</p> <p>The California-based company, along with its tech giant peers, also faces serious potential threats to its business in the upcoming <strong>Digital Markets Act</strong>, a draft policy proposal that seeks to curb the industry's power.</p> <p>EU officials met on Tuesday to discuss a common text, which will probably include tougher scrutiny in so-called killer acquisitions — potentially preventing a repeat of deals such as Facebook's takeover of <strong>WhatsApp </strong>and<strong> Instagram </strong>— which critics argue have allowed tech giants to grow even faster and to buy out potential future competitors. </p> <p>The new rules are set to also ban alleged anti-competitive behaviour whereby Google places preference on its own services over rivals on its platform.</p> <p>No wonder Google is ramping up its efforts in last-minute campaigns to try to influence the final text, which will be the first time the EU sets rules for the digital markets in more than two decades. </p> <p>The tech company has utilised both direct lobbying and the help of several trade associations to campaign for a watering down of the new rules. Some of its techniques include siding with small businesses in Europe by arguing that tougher rules could potentially hit their growth.</p> <p>It's unclear whether Google's efforts will have the intended effect. </p> <p>“They are the bad guys at the moment,” a parliamentary assistant involved in the DMA discussions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c7527bc-7ab4-41cd-ba94-3145208da9c3\">told DD's Javier Espinoza</a>. “Everything coming from them is a bit awkward and hard to justify why we would include it in the legislation.”</p> <h1>The borrowing binge is back</h1> <p>Companies rang in the new year with a bang, raising more than $100bn on the bond market in the first week of January. It makes sense. Bankers say finance chiefs are eager to lock in low borrowing costs before central banks<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f76d5033-ed8f-46fa-9313-e93597cee06f\"> begin raising</a> short-term interest rates.</p> <p>Global corporate bond issuance reached $101bn in the year to January 7, second only to last year's blockbuster $118bn start, which was the highest on<strong> Refinitiv</strong> records going back 19 years, the FT's Joe Rennison<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d72dbda9-0164-4e89-8898-b162538ce605\"> reports</a>.</p> <p><strong>Royal Caribbean Group</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/174afa14-4914-4959-89e8-83c3e3f6a6f7\">hit hard</a> by the pandemic, launched one of the first lower-rated junk bond market deals of the year last Tuesday with a $1bn issue. </p> <p>The deluge of new deals is just the beginning, with a raft of new debt offerings scheduled ahead of what's expected to be a slightly slower earnings season.</p> <p><strong>Adam Aron</strong>, CEO of AMC Entertainment, cited a new year's resolution of his own that could test investor appetite for risky debt. Aron plans to refinance the cinema chain's existing bonds in the hopes of cutting the company's interest costs.</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1477998104624381957\">https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1477998104624381957</a> <p>Volatile markets could pose challenges. Investors pulled some orders for new bond deals last Wednesday after the Fed released<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35766dd4-7da1-4064-9e60-79a714297c5a\"> hawkish minutes</a> from its December meeting, bankers said.</p> <p>Not to mention that the average yield on investment-grade bonds has already risen from 2.36 per cent to 2.55 per cent since the start of the year, according to an index run by <strong>Ice Data Services</strong>.</p> <p>Hence why bankers are encouraging companies to secure funds now, before it gets harder.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Facebook</strong> parent company <strong>Meta </strong>has appointed <strong>DoorDash</strong> co-founder and chief executive <strong>Tony Xu</strong> as a director on its board.</p></li>  <li><p>Japan's<strong> Mizuho Financial Group</strong> is set to appoint senior executive <strong>Masahiro Kihara</strong> as its new president, <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Mizuho-Financial-taps-Masahiro-Kihara-as-next-president\">per Nikkei Asia</a>. He will replace <strong>Tatsufumi Sakai</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e049114c-344b-4230-a682-9c6d6c438663\">resigned in November</a> after the government intervened following IT failures at the financial services conglomerate's banking arm.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Moxie Marlinspike</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/707b5619-f01e-45a1-9300-2c9e46c0b99c\">is stepping down</a> as chief executive of encrypted messaging app <strong>Signal</strong>. He will remain on the company's board, and will be replaced as CEO on an interim basis by <strong>WhatsApp</strong> co-founder <strong>Brian Acton</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Gary Lindsay</strong> and <strong>Tom Mitchell</strong> will become managing partners at <strong>TDR Capital</strong>, taking over management of the firm from its co-founders <strong>Manjit Dale</strong> and <strong>Stephen Robertson</strong>, TDR said in a note to investors. Dale will become chief investment officer. <strong>Thibaut Large</strong> will leave the firm and <strong>Jon Rosen</strong> will scale back his TDR responsibilities in order to spend more time on charitable activities, the note said. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone</strong> has appointed<strong> Jean Rogers</strong>, founder and former CEO of the <strong>Sustainability Accounting Standards Board</strong>, as global head of environmental, social and governance.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Jefferies</strong> has hired <strong>Thomas Blackmore</strong> as head of FIG debt capital markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p></li>  <li><p>Law firm<strong> Cooley</strong> has hired <strong>Tim Pitrelli </strong>as a partner in its capital markets practice, based in Singapore. He was previously an executive director and senior counsel at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Selective admission </strong>Singapore has opened its doors to a new crop of cryptocurrency groups as it strives to become Asia's most innovative financial hub. But not everyone is welcome, including the world's wealthiest crypto mogul.
