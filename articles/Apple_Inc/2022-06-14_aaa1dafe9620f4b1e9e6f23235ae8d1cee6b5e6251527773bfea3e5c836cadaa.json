  "title": "Markets Dive, Fed Eyes Bigger Rise --- Worries about prices send S&P 500 into bear territory, spur bets on aggressive rate moves",
  "text": "<p>Even rare bets that have worked in 2022 stumbled on Monday. The energy segment, the only one of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors in positive territory this year, fell 5.1%, a steeper decline than that of the index. The utilities group, the second-best performer in 2022, lagged behind the market with a drop of 4.6%.</p><p>\"We're definitely seeing a risk-off atmosphere, a flight to quality,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. \"In that environment, people need to raise cash.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 151.23 points, or 3.9%, to 3749.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 876.05 points, or 2.8%, to 30516.74. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 530.80 points, or 4.7%, to 10809.23, off 33% from its November record.</p><p>Stock futures for Tuesday rose, suggesting U.S. markets were poised for a slight recovery. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.6% Tuesday morning in Asia. Those for the Dow and the Nasdaq increased 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively.</p><p>Shares in Asia remained under pressure. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.1%, Japan's Nikkei 225 retreated 2% and South Korea's Kospi Composite shed 1.2%. In mainland China, the blue-chip CSI 300 declined 1.9%.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rout in cryptocurrencies highlighted investors' increasing unwillingness to hang on to their most speculative holdings. The price of bitcoin plunged Monday below $23,000, before paring that loss to trade at 5 p.m. Eastern down 66% from its November high.</p><p>Shares of Coinbase Global fell 11%, while Celsius Network said it was pausing all withdrawals and swaps between cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Markets have swung wildly this year as investors tried to decipher how rapidly the central bank will raise interest rates in an attempt to tame inflation. Rock-bottom rates and other stimulative policies helped keep the economy -- as well as markets -- afloat as the pandemic idled businesses and threw people out of work.</p><p>Now, the Fed is trying to tame surging prices by unwinding that easy-money policy. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday afternoon that the Fed, which is set to begin its latest two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, will likely consider a bigger increase of 0.75 point after a string of troubling inflation reports.</p><p>Friday's data showed U.S. consumer prices rose 8.6% year over year in May, the fastest such increase since 1981. The report jolted markets and intensified fears that the campaign of monetary tightening could tip the economy into a recession.</p><p>\"If inflation is going higher, the Federal Reserve has no choice but to raise interest rates,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \"The higher the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates, and the longer they need to keep raising interest rates, the more likely it is that we go into a recession.\"</p><p>On Monday, futures bets showed traders assigned a roughly 85% probability that the Fed will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate by at least 2.5 percentage points by the end of the year from its current range between 0.75% and 1%, according to CME Group. That would equate to at least a half-percentage-point rate increase at every Fed meeting this year. On Friday, traders placed the chances of that at 50%, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"It seems as though inflation is staying for longer than expected,\" said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS. \"People are now beginning to fear that the Fed will have to go further or faster in terms of interest rates.\"</p><p>Government-bond yields surged on Monday as investors worried that persistent inflation could prompt the Fed to raise rates higher and faster than expected. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 3.371% on Monday, its highest closing level since 2011, from 3.156% Friday. It was its largest one-day yield gain since March 2020.</p><p>U.S. tech stocks, which soared throughout the pandemic, notched big declines. Apple shares fell 3.8%, while Amazon.com shares lost 5.5%. Chip maker Nvidia slid 7.8% and Tesla dropped 7.1%. Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, lost 6.4%.</p><p>\"This is what you call a bear market, where fear is taking place and pushing people out of the market and having people empty up portfolios and capitulate,\" said Todd Morgan, the chairman of Los Angeles-based Bel Air Investment Advisors.</p><p>Still, Mr. Morgan said developments in the next month or two could help damp inflationary pressures, such as lower gasoline demand after the summer and slowing demand for houses due to rising mortgage rates.</p><p>He added: \"China opening up is a big deal, too,\" as that would help ease supply-chain constraints. Figures last week showed Chinese exports to the rest of the world surged in May as Covid-19 restrictions eased, adding to signs of economic recovery there.</p><p>At a conference Monday, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said, \"We're in a brave new world right now. I don't think anyone can accurately predict inflation one year from now.\"</p><p>In currency markets, the dollar gained against a range of its peers, with the WSJ Dollar Index climbing 0.9% to 97.66. Higher U.S. interest rates typically boost the dollar's value.</p><p>Stock markets abroad on Monday were jolted by fears of tighter U.S. policy and a potential slowdown in the world's biggest economy. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 2.4% to its lowest closing value since March 2021, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 1.5%.</p><p>Early Tuesday, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index in Sydney erased 4.8%, putting the benchmark on course for its biggest one-day drop in percentage terms in more than two years.</p><p>---</p><p>Quentin Webb, Dave Sebastian and Megumi Fujikawa contributed to this article.</p><p>(See related article: \"Central bank weighs 0.75 percentage point boost this week as inflation data worsen\" -- WSJ June 14, 2022)</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
