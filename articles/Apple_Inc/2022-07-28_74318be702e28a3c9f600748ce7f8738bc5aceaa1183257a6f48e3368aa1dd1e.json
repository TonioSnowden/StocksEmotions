  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 355 points, or 1.1%, to 32,553.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 index SPX was up 45 points, or 1.1%, at 4,068.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 92.5 points, or 0.8%, to 12,124.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 436 points, or 1.37%, to 32198, the S&amp;P 500 increased 103 points, or 2.62%, to 4024, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 470 points, or 4.06%, to 12032. For the Nasdaq, it was the best one-day percentage gain since April 6, 2020. Stocks rallied sharply following the Fed's latest rate-hike, and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks rallied Thursday following the release of data of second-quarter GDP which showed that the U.S. economy had contracted by 0.9% between the beginning of April and end of June. The data marked a second consecutive quarter of contraction following a minus 1.6% print for the first quarter of 2022. Stocks have recently greeted signs of a slowing economy with gains, as investors bet that weak data might pressure the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes.</p><p>See: U.S. economy shrinks in the second quarter, GDP shows, and invites talk of recession</p><p>Meanwhile, some market strategists argued that the data wasn't bad enough to reflect the economy is already in a recession, or pressure the Federal Reserve to rethink its rate-hike plans.</p><p>\" We are not in recession. Consumer spending was too strong to raise any recession signals,\" Jeffrey Roach, Chief Economist for LPL Financial, wrote in a note. \"However, higher interest rates are weighing heavily on business investment. The decline in total private investment was broad-based and could be an ominous sign. Investors should not be surprised in the decline in commercial and residential real estate, but the decline in general business capital spending reveals a budding weakness in the corporate sector of the economy.\"</p><p>\"The Fed will likely interpret this decline in real growth as confirmation to slow down the pace of rate hikes at the upcoming meetings,\" he said.</p><p>Weekly initial jobless claims fell by 5,000 to 256,000 in the week ended July 23, according to the latest weekly reading on the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. However, the four-week average of new claims rose for the eight straight week.</p><p>The surge in stocks that began Wednesday has been fueled in part by Powell saying that interest rates are now in the range of neutral territory and that the pace of hikes may slow, though he left another 75 basis point hike in September as a possibility.</p><p>See: Was Fed's Powell dovish or not? 4 key takeaways from Wednesday's press conference</p><p>Lydia Boussour, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said they expect inflation readings will remain elevated in coming months and prompt another 75 basis point rate hike in September, and then it will push the Fed to shift to a series of 25 basis point hikes before cutting rates next year.</p><p>Corporate earnings have also been an important driver of markets this week, which is expected to be the busiest week of such reports for the entire quarter. Meta Platforms META, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, released their quarterly report late Wednesday, showing worse than forecast profit and sales and guiding to revenue below estimates in the current quarter.</p><p>See: Facebook revenue declines for first time, and Meta's downfall is expected to get worse</p><p>Looking ahead, earnings are due from Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Mastercard MA after Thursday's market close.</p><p>Nearly 49% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings through Thursday's open. Of those companies 71.5% have beaten estimates, FactSet data shows.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Ford Motor Company F shares were up 5% after the carmaker reported a more than 50% increase in total sales during the second quarter.</p><p>* Shares of Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. SWK slid 14.1% after the tool maker's second-quarter earnings fell far short of estimates.</p><p>* Pfizer Inc. PFE shares dropped 1% even after the pharmaceutical giant reported big second-quarter profit and revenue beats driven primarily by sales of its COVID drugs.</p><p>* Shares of Meta Platforms META slid 6.7% after the Facebook parent company reported its first-ever quarterly sales decline.</p><p>* Spirit Airlines SAVE shares were up 4.5% after JetBlue JBLU agreed to a $3.8 billion deal to buy Spirit.</p><p>* Trading in Bausch Health Companies BHC was briefly halted Thursday morning and was down 50.3% after a Delaware federal court judge issued an oral order on patent litigation over Xifaxan, Bausch's drug that treats irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea.</p><p>Other markets</p><p>* West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery CL.1 CLU22 fell 0.7% to $96.55.</p><p>* Gold GC00 GCQ22 for October delivery gained $27.70, or 1.6%, to trade at $1,736.90 per ounce.</p><p>* The ICE U.S. Dollar Index was up 0.1% as the Japanese yen weakened following the latest Bank of Japan meeting.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD and ethereum prices ETHUSD surged Thursday, with bitcoin trading north of $23,000 and ethereum above $1,600.</p><p>* The STOXX Europe 600 Index XX:SXXP rose 1.09% Thursday and London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX dropped 0.04%.</p><p>* In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index CN:SHCOMP ended 0.21% higher, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI was down 0.23%.</p><p>â€” Steve Goldstein contributed to this article.</p><p>Dow up 350 points, stocks hit 6-week highs as investors shrug off weak GDP number</p>",
