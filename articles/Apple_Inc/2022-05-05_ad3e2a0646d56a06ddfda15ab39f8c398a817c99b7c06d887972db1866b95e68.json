  "title": "Business News:  Meta Hits  The Brakes  On Hiring  Spree  ----  By Salvador Rodriguez",
  "text": "<p>   Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. on Wednesday announced a sharp slowdown in hiring, ending an extended period in which the tech giant added thousands of jobs a year. </p><p>   \"We regularly re-evaluate our talent pipeline according to our business needs and in light of the expense guidance given for this earnings period, we are slowing its growth accordingly,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. \"However, we will continue to grow our workforce to ensure we focus on long term impact.\" </p><p>   Specifically, Meta will be halting, or in some cases slowing, hiring for more mid- to senior-level positions, according to the company. This follows a recent pause on hiring early-career engineers a few weeks back. </p><p>   Like other tech giants, Meta has been a hiring juggernaut in recent years, more than doubling the size of its workforce since 2018. </p><p>   At the end of the first quarter, Meta counted 77,800 full-time employees, up 28% from a year earlier, according to the company's most recent quarterly report. </p><p>   The company doesn't have any plans for layoffs at this time, it said. Meta overshot some of its hiring goals -- it hired more people in the first quarter of 2022 than it did in all of 2021 -- and it is adjusting accordingly, the company said. </p><p>   The shift in hiring strategy comes after a string of disappointing quarters for the social-media company. </p><p>   Last week, the company posted its slowest revenue growth since going public a decade ago as it navigates growing competition from the likes of TikTok and privacy headwinds for its advertising business. In February, the company said it estimated that ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple Inc. last year would cost it some $10 billion this year. </p><p>   The company also cited the Ukraine conflict and broader macroeconomic conditions as factors for the slowdown. </p><p>   The hiring strategy shift was earlier reported by Business Insider. </p><p>   Meta shares climbed on the news, gaining more than 5% Wednesday. </p><p>   Since February, the company's shares have dropped more than 30%. That is equivalent to a loss of $274.6 billion in market value. </p><p></p>",
