But amid safer plays, such as CBS's brand extensions \"NCIS: Hawai'i\" (Sept. 20), \"FBI: International\" (Sept. 21) and \"CSI: Vegas\" (Oct. 6), there are some more outlandish swings, such as NBC's \"La Brea\" (Sept. 28), in which a giant sinkhole dumps Los Angelenos into a parallel, primeval world.</p><p>Big Album Comebacks.
