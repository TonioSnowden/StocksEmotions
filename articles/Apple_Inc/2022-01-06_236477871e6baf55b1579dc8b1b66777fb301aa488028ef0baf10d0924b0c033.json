  "title": "Are Foldable Smartphones Finally Cool? After years of slow sales, there are early signs that the flexible-screen technology pioneered by Samsung is gaining wider consumer acceptance",
  "text": "<p>A lower price point has likely attracted consumers: Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 3 goes for around $1,000, in line with other high-end smartphones like the iPhone 13 Pro. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 costs around $1,800, but that is cheaper than its predecessors. The original Galaxy Fold sold for around $2,000 in 2019. Samsung has also ironed out some of the earlier problems, making sturdier screens and better hinges.</p><p>Foldable smartphones represented just 8.6 million of last year's total smartphone shipments of around 1.4 billion, Counterpoint estimates. But the flip side of being small is that the market could grow fast: Last year's foldable shipments were nearly three times those of the year before, and Counterpoint expects them to triple again to 25.7 million in 2023.</p><p>Their higher prices mean foldables also contribute more to profits. Credit Suisse estimates that last year their share of Samsung's operating profit from smartphones was 8%, which could rise to 16% in 2023. As it grows harder to persuade consumers to pay up for a new phone, a foldable version—with its bigger screen than would otherwise fit in a pocket—could be a way.</p><p>In the near future, supply constraints could hold back the growth in foldables. Further out, the challenge will come from other smartphone manufacturers: Chinese brands like Oppo and Honor are getting into the market. That will eat into Samsung's market share—Credit Suisse expects it to fall to 65% by 2025—but also drive wider adoption, likely lowering costs. Samsung also benefits from supplying other phone makers with the flexible screens, called organic light-emitting diodes or OLEDs, a market it is likely to continue to dominate.</p><p>Samsung will surely hope it is finally the year to flip the flop in foldables.</p><p>Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com</p><p>Are Foldable Smartphones Finally Cool?</p>",
