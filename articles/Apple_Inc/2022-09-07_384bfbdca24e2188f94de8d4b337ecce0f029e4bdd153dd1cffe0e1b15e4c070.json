  "title": "Apple's iPhone 14 Lineup Headlines Wednesday Product Event; The tech giant revealed its most expensive 5G-capable smartphones",
  "text": "<p>The tech giant focused on safety features for the iPhone 14 lineup and newest smartwatches, adding sensors that can detect car crashes and alert authorities. The new smartphones will get satellite connectivity for sending emergency messages to use in areas not touched by cellular towers.</p><p>Apple Event Live Updates</p><p>Apple unveiled new Apple Watch models at its annual September event.</p><p>Many analysts had expected to see Apple increase prices for some iPhones, but the company kept starting prices the same compared with a year ago for both base and high-end models. It dropped the cheapest iPhone Mini version.</p><p>Demand for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups helped Apple post record profits and sales in the past two years. IPhone revenue rose 39% in fiscal 2021 and is expected to rise another 6.7% to a record $205 billion this fiscal year, which ends later this month.</p><p>\"The iPhone's sales performance year to date has been impressive, and is the biggest reason why the company has largely bucked the economic downturn,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. \"Keeping that segment's momentum going this holiday in the face of a stressed consumer will be top of mind for investors when the new models are unveiled.\"</p><p>Apple has defied an industrywide decline in smartphone shipments, which slipped almost 9% in the past quarter compared with a year earlier, according to researcher International Data Corp. During the first half, the bright spot in the market was smartphones priced above $900, according to Counterpoint Research.</p><p>The biggest changes on Wednesday were in the higher-end iPhone Pro models that cost more and have helped drive more revenue for the company. Apple revealed 6.1- and 6.7-inch display versions of the Pro models and added a 6.7-inch offering—called iPhone 14 Plus—to the iPhone 14 base version along with the 6.1-inch display.</p><p>The Pro versions got a new faster A16 chip and screen that is brighter and allows for always-on display. The high-end phones come with a new design that houses the front camera in a pill-shaped hole in the screen replacing the iPhone 13's notch. It surfaces alerts in what Apple is calling the dynamic island that expands across the top of the screen. The high-end devices have a bigger camera system with more-advanced zooming among other capabilities.</p><p>The base iPhone 14 with the 6.1-inch display will start at the same price as last year's iPhone 13. The new larger-size 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus starts at $899 while the same-sized Pro version with a better camera system and other upgrades starts at $999. The bigger iPhone Pro Max starts at $1,099.</p><p>Some analysts were predicting Apple would increase prices with the iPhone 14 as the company faces increased cost pressures.</p><p>\"It is impressive that Apple has maintained year-on-year pricing parity on the new iPhone 14 devices in the U.S.,\" Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said in an email. \"We had anticipated that inflation, increased production and component costs, and other expenses such as more expensive shipping would have led Apple to increase its retail pricing.\"</p><p>The company also announced a new high-end version dubbed Apple Watch Ultra, starting at $799 and including a larger screen, more battery life and improved GPS precision. The Ultra, aimed at adventure users from backcountry hikers to scuba divers, has a new look with rounded edges along with an added button for custom actions and a crown that is designed to be used wearing gloves.</p><p>Additionally, Apple introduced the Series 8 model that measures temperature—helping estimate ovulation—and detects if a car crash has occurred. The Series 8 begins at $399 while an updated cheaper Apple Watch model, starting at $249 dubbed the SE, includes the crash detection feature.</p><p>Healthcare, wellness and fitness uses continue to be in focus for the gadget that first went on sale in 2015.</p><p>After the watches, the company showed updated AirPods Pro headphones that the company said would have improved the noise-canceling capabilities by blocking double the amount of sound and customizable spatial audio. The gadgets will start at $249.</p><p>One of the biggest technological changes announced Wednesday was the arrival of satellite connectivity for smartphones. The new service, called Emergency SOS via satellite, will allow iPhone 14 users to send special low-bandwidth text messages to emergency responders through space-based relays. Apple said the service will launch in November in the U.S. and Canada. The company plans to offer the service for free for two years.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What new Apple products are you most excited for? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Smartphones have long been used the U.S. Global Positioning System's existing network of satellites for wayfinding, but technical limitations have typically kept consumer-grade devices from reaching space-borne communications networks. The power needed to send a strong signal skyward has restricted the market to heavy, expensive satellite phones from specialists including Iridium Communications Inc. and Globalstar Inc.</p><p>New constellations of satellites with Earth-hugging orbits have brought the technology within reach, though smartphones still need microchips and antennas capable of reaching them. Apple said it spent years working on the technology, which uses an app to tell users where in the sky to point the device.</p><p>Globalstar confirmed in a regulatory filing Wednesday that it will supply the new Apple service using spectrum licenses it already holds. The Covington, La., company has international licenses to send space-to-ground signals over 11.5 megahertz of wireless spectrum.</p><p>Using a one-stop shop for regulatory licenses could allow Apple to eventually offer its satellite service outside of North America. Other companies pursuing satellite-phone services could face the need for individual government approvals in each country where they plan to offer service.</p><p>Space Exploration Technologies Inc., better known as SpaceX, reached a deal with T-Mobile US Inc. to develop satellite-based phone service over the coming years. That agreement could eventually allow the cellphone carrier to offer its own satellite-based services, but it would be restricted to U.S. territories where T-Mobile holds the needed spectrum licenses.</p><p>Drew Fitzgerald contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com</p><p>Apple's iPhone 14 Lineup Headlines Wednesday Product Event</p>",
