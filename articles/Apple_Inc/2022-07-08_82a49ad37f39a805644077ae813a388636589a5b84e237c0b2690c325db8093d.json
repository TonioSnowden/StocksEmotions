  "text": "<p>\"Families ready to go on vacation are running into a problem: They can't find anyone to watch their dogs.\"</p><p>â€”The Wall Street Journal, \"The Hardest Part of Summer Vacation Is Finding Someone to Watch the Dog,\" by Allison Pohle, July 4.</p><p>Hi. Hi! It is I, the dog, Ralph. Hi! Hi!</p><p>I understand that family is going on another family trip. Ralph is sad. I am sad because I am going to miss you. It is not same for Ralph when you are not here. House too quiet. Dark. Sometimes there's thunder and lightning. Ralph gets scared and chews fur.</p><p>Usually you find someone to look after me. In the past Ralph got watched by the college kid from down the street. He was nice. He threw ball and threw ball again. Then there was the 15-year-old who would come over and play with her iPad but not so much Ralph.</p><p>Now the college kid has graduated and the 15-year-old decided to become a babysitter. Babysitters get, like, $30 an hour now, which is much more than what they get paid for Ralph.</p><p>I would like to propose something, to save my family hassle:</p><p>Ralph can watch Ralphself. I will be my own dog sitter.</p><p>I can be trusted. Ralph is now 4 years old, which is, like, human 28, old enough to drive and vote and think about going back to graduate school for another degree. You can leave Ralph alone for a week. Or maybe even two weeks.</p><p>OK just one week.</p><p>Ralph would prefer to go to lake house rental with everyone. I like to swim for ball and then swim for ball again. But Ralph knows he is not invited to lake house after Ralph ate needlepoint pillow and a whole candle at the other lake house rental.</p><p>Ralph did not feel great after that. He did not like going to that vet near the lake house.</p><p>You don't need anyone to watch me. Ralph knows where everything is. Ralph knows where dog food is, and also the cat's food, which is tastier. He knows where you keep the good bourbon and also the old Halloween candy in the closet.</p><p>If Ralph run out of food and Halloween candy Ralph knows to shop at the corner market, not the fancy market where an apple costs $6.</p><p>Ralph knows where TV remote is and also how to close windows if it rains. Ralph will bark, bark, bark at any intruder until neighbors come to check. Ralph will also bark at fireworks, car alarms, police sirens, owls, moths, the air conditioner, the fridge, the ceiling fan, mirrors, all trucks and sometimes for absolutely no reason.</p><p>Ralph will be lonely but he knows how to play Minecraft on iPad.</p><p>All you need to do is keep dog door open for Ralph so Ralph can go outside and do his business. Also chase bunny.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Would you leave Ralph alone in the house? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Ralph keeps counter clean, fridge stocked, beds made, and sleeps only in Ralph bed with RALPH name.</p><p>Eat no candle, promise.</p><p>What do you think? I think it's time to do this. Let Ralph grow up a little bit, treat Ralph good boy because is good boy.</p><p>What's the word? Responsibility? Ralph is responsibility.</p><p>I think you can go to lake house rental no problems and you will save money, and then buy something nice for Ralph, like a new can of balls, or a candle.</p><p>Just kidding no candles. Ralph already promise. Enjoy lake.</p><p>As told to Jason Gay</p><p>Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com</p><p>A Dog Writes: It's OK You Can't Find Pet Sitter, Let Me Take Care of Myself</p>",
