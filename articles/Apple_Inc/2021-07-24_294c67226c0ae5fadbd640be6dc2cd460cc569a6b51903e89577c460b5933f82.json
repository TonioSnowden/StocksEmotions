  "title": "World News:  For Big Tech, the U.K. Is the New Copper on the Beat  ----  By Parmy Olson",
  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- The U.K.'s competition authority is stepping out of the shadow of the European Union, launching a flurry of new cases against big tech companies and becoming a new source of global scrutiny. </p><p>   Earlier this month, the British government said it would bolster the Competition and Markets Authority, the country's longtime competition watchdog, granting it new powers to move more quickly to probe and fix anticompetitive behavior. The move would strengthen its ability to fine companies and prevent takeovers that might stymie competition. </p><p>   After the U.K. split from the bloc at the end of 2020, the CMA began exerting its powers aggressively in a series of high-profile cases. It has targeted Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. </p><p>   The CMA's chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said  the agency wants to take a leading role in shaping the behavior of powerful tech firms world-wide. \"In a way we're coming out of the shadows of the European Commission,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Coscelli said he is now free to move independently, speeding up investigations, and that the agency can act within weeks of getting a complaint. \"Before we had to be part of a discussion,\" he said. </p><p>   The CMA's case work has increased by 30% to 50% since Brexit, Mr. Coscelli said. To cope with that influx, he is close to nearly doubling the agency's workforce to 1,000. That means competing for talent with large technology companies themselves, which have hundreds of well-paying vacancies in their legal and policy teams globally. </p><p>   Thomas Vinje, chairman of antitrust practice at Clifford Chance LLP in Brussels, said the CMA is \"moving faster than most antitrust authorities seem able to do . . . . If I'm sitting in the headquarters of one of the big four technology companies, I definitely have one eye on the CMA.\" </p><p>   EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said she welcomed the regulation competition. \"I find it really natural that they now assert themselves,\" she said. </p><p>   Mr. Coscelli said his priorities include more scrutiny of acquisitions that could bolster a tech giant's market position. He also aims to push large tech companies to make their data and systems more accessible to smaller rivals. </p><p>   The agency is investigating whether Apple's App Store sets out unfair terms for app developers and whether Facebook is gaining illegal advantages for its own services, such as dating and classified ads, from data it gathers from Facebook's advertisers. </p><p>   Apple said it would work with the CMA, and defended the requirements it places on app developers, saying they are applied \"fairly and equally.\" Facebook said it operates in a competitive environment and would \"continue to cooperate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.\" </p><p>   The CMA's new assertiveness comes as Brussels continues regulatory probes against big tech firms and has teed up legislation to curb their influence. </p><p></p>",
