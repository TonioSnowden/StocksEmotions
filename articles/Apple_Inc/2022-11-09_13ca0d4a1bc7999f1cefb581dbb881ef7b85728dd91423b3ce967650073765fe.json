  "text": "<p>    Meta Platforms Inc. will begin laying off employees on Wednesday morning, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told hundreds of executives at a meeting on Tuesday. </p><p>   The coming cuts are expected to total many thousands of employees and will likely be the largest of the year to date in the technology sector. </p><p>   Mr. Zuckerberg appeared downcast in Tuesday's meeting and said he was accountable for the company's missteps, and that his over-optimism about growth had led to overstaffing, according to people familiar with the meeting. </p><p>   Meta's head of human resources, Lori Goler, told the group that employees who lose their jobs will be provided with at least four months of salary as severance, according to people familiar with the meeting. </p><p>   Mr. Zuckerberg described broad cuts and specifically mentioned the recruiting and business teams as among those facing layoffs. </p><p>   A general internal announcement of the company's layoff plans is expected around 6 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, with the specific employees losing their jobs informed over the course of the morning. </p><p>   Inside Meta, employees have been seeking specifics about the coming layoffs for days and planning for the worst by forming external groups with current colleagues. </p><p>   Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September. Company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week. </p><p>   The planned layoffs would be the first broad head-count reductions to occur in the company's 18-year history. </p><p>    Meta's stock has fallen more than 70% this year. </p><p>   The company has highlighted deteriorating macroeconomic trends, but investors have been spooked by its spending and threats to the company's core social-media business. Growth for that business in many markets has stalled amid stiff competition from TikTok, and Apple Inc.'s requirement that users opt in to the tracking of their devices has curtailed the ability of social-media platforms to target ads. </p><p>   After hiring aggressively through the pandemic, the tech industry is facing its biggest retrenchment in years. Twitter Inc. is laying off thousands of employees under new owner Elon Musk, as he tries to restructure the company. </p><p>    Snap Inc. said in August it would cut roughly 20% of staff, or more than 1,000 employees. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Salvador Rodriguez contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
