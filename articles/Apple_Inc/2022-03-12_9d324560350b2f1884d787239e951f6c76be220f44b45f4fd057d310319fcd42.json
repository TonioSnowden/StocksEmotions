  "text": "<p>Mr. Allsbrook was a fishmonger at the specialty market Balducci's in McLean, Va., and moved on to learn butchery at the Organic Butcher when it opened in McLean in 2005. \"That's when I knew I found my niche,\" he said. Over 15 years there, he cultivated a following and a reputation that propelled him to open his own shop in March 2020 -- just as the pandemic set in. Mr. Allsbrook persevered, and thanks to shifts in his business plan and a loyal clientele, Georgetown Butcher celebrated its second anniversary this month. Mr. Allsbrook signed a lease on a second location, in the National Landing section of Northern Virginia, to open in 2024.</p><p>His ultimate goal is to educate consumers on why they should patronize local, independent butchers. In his view, it comes down to quality products and specialty cuts they won't find at the supermarket. His signature \"Georgetown cut\" (aka butcher's cut or bavette) is popular with his own customers. Another ambition of his, to establish a butchering mentorship program, stems from a wish to give back to his community. \"If I can help train people, I can help build a stronger workforce,\" he promised.</p><p>It's hardly surprising, given his commitment to quality and DIY ethos, that Mr. Allsbrook enjoys making his own bacon and strongly encourages others to do the same. He likes the fresh, porky flavor and the fact it doesn't contain nitrates or other additives. He's also happy to control the salt content.</p><p>Mr. Allsbrook's method, laid out below, is simple. He wet-brines the pork belly in apple cider, dry-brines it in salt, then cooks it low and slow in the oven, ultimately producing what he calls an \"applewood-smoked essence.\" Cut into strips, this bacon is terrific pan-fried or oven-baked. Mr. Allsbrook loves it caramelized with brown sugar and butter. But he encourages you to do it your own way.</p><p>---</p><p>Homemade Apple-Cider-Brined Bacon</p><p>Wendell Allsbrook's method requires some planning ahead to account for brining time, but the execution is simple, resulting in intensely porky strips with slightly sweet undertones.</p><p>What You'll Need:</p><p>6-quart stock pot</p><p>Whisk</p><p>9-by-13-inch roasting pan</p><p>Flat rack, about 15 by 12 inches (larger than pan so rack can sit on top)</p><p>1/2 gallon apple cider</p><p>1/2 cup sea salt for apple cider brine plus 1 cup sea salt for salt brine</p><p>1/2 cup honey</p><p>3 pounds pork belly, skin on and scored</p><p>Aluminum foil, plastic wrap or butcher paper</p><p>Chef's knife</p><p>Skillet</p><p>Step 1: Pour apple cider into stock pot. Add 1/2 cup sea salt and honey. Whisk until salt dissolves. Place pork in pot, submerged in brine. Cover pot and refrigerate for 24 hours.</p><p>Step 2: Remove pork from brine, pat dry and place on foil, plastic wrap or butcher paper. Cover pork on all sides with 1 cup sea salt. Wrap and refrigerate 24 hours.</p><p>Step 3: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cover roasting pan with rack. Remove pork from refrigerator, rinse off salt and pat dry. Place pork on rack. When oven reaches 400 degrees, immediately reduce heat to 250 degrees and transfer pork to oven.</p><p>Step 4: Cook pork until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center reads 140 degrees, 4 1/2- 5 hours. Check pork after 3 hours. If it is browning too quickly, reduce heat to 175 and continue cooking until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees.</p><p>Step 5: Once pork is out of oven, let sit on rack until cooled slightly, 10 minutes. Slice off skin and reserve for another use (like pork rinds). Wrap pork in foil, plastic wrap or butcher paper, and refrigerate overnight.</p><p>Step 6: Remove pork from refrigerator. Slice chilled pork crosswise into strips about 1/8 inch thick. To serve, pan-fry strips in a skillet over medium heat or bake in the oven at 400 until desired doneness.</p><p>Pro-tips:</p><p>-- Buy pork belly with the skin on: It will add flavor and help the cut retain its shape. A quality piece of pork belly should have a lot of fat and marbling.</p><p>-- Ask your butcher to score the skin so that the brine will penetrate more easily.</p><p>-- If the bacon is chilled when you cut it, it will be easier to slice into strips.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
