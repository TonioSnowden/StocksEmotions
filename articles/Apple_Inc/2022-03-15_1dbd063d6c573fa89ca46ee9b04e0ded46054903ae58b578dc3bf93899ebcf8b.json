  "title": "Ford's electric Mustang Mach-E is hot, and it's becoming scarce",
  "text": "<p>It's still possible to buy a Mustang Mach-E Select or GT model. But the rest of the lineup appears to be sold out.</p><p>The start of Ford's new EV lineup</p><p>The Mustang Mach-E is Ford's first mass-market electric vehicle (EV) after several small-scale electrification experiments over the past two decades. It's a midsize SUV that shares some design language with the iconic Mustang and gets up to 314 miles on a charge. It's the first EV to mount a serious challenge to Tesla's dominance,&#xa0;quickly becoming the third best-selling EV in the U.S. and the first non-Tesla TSLA product to crack the top four.</p><p>Those numbers are expected to change as most automakers introduce new electric cars this year, challenging Tesla's dominance with new competition.</p><p>The Mustang Mach-E kicked off a stable of new EVs from Ford.&#xa0;The company plans to split into two units â€” one that builds EVs and one that builds gasoline-powered cars. The next Ford EV to appear in your neighborhood will likely be the&#xa0;F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford has sold hundreds of thousands of reservations for the electric truck, which should begin reaching buyers late this year.</p><p>Read:What is EV, BEV, HEV, PHEV? Here's your guide to types of electric cars</p><p>About the Mach-E</p><p>A sharp-looking crossover, the Mach-E is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety &#xa0;(IIHS) Top Safety Pick. It missed that organization's Top Safety Pick Plus designation only because the Select model comes with a lesser grade of headlights. The IIHS awards its highest honor only to vehicles that offer their best headlights at every trim level.</p><p>The Mach-E has been a sales success. Few of them appear on dealership lots because Ford has sold many through a pre-order system, so intense is demand.</p><p>Don't miss: Carpooling, waiting in line for Costco gas, and no more driving grandkids. Reluctantly, Americans adapt to rising gas prices.</p><p>Two of five trims left</p><p>At launch, there were five trim levels: Select, GT, GT Performance, Premium, and California Route 1. But visit the car's online configurator this morning, and you'll find just two of those models still offered. Buyers looking to place an order today can choose from the Select and GT models.</p><p>The Mustang Mach-E Select is a rear-wheel-drive edition with an MSRP of $43,895, plus a $1,100 destination fee. It uses a single motor attached to the rear axle, good for 266 horsepower. Its 68 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack has a range of up to 247 miles. Standard features include dual-zone climate control, synthetic leather upholstery, a power driver's seat, and wireless Android Auto and Apple AAPL CarPlay.</p><p>Related:&#xa0;Does driving an electric car really save you money? A cheapskate runs the numbers</p><p>The GT model has a pricier sticker at $61,995 plus the same $1,100 destination charge. It uses two motors, one per axle, for all-wheel-drive and 480 horsepower. Its larger, 88 kWh battery pack gives it 270 miles of range despite the added power. Standard features include sport seats with grippy Miko inserts, perforated power seats, ambient interior lighting, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen 10-speaker premium audio system.</p><p>Months-long wait</p><p>Interested shoppers should know there's another wrinkle beyond limited selection. The Mach-E online configurator says that, should you order a Mach-E Select today, you can expect delivery in August at the earliest. The GT model will deliver in October.</p><p>See:&#xa0;All the companies that are making or planning electric vehicles</p><p>Ford is scaling up Mach-E production and should be able to build the cars faster in 2023.</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
