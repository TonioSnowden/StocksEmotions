  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's highest court denied bail to pro-democracy newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai, the most prominent figure facing prosecution under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing to silence opposition after a year of unrest. </p><p>   The businessman and longtime critic of China's Communist Party is charged with foreign collusion, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The decision signals that courts will set a high standard for granting bail to anyone charged under the national security law. </p><p>   Mr. Lai, who is in his early 70s, is among a handful of defendants heading to trial under a law imposed last year -- and was the only one so far that a judge had released on bail pending trial. His case is being watched closely in mainland China and in Hong Kong as a test of how the law will be enforced in the former British colony, which has largely governed itself and retained its U.K.-style legal system since its return to China in 1997. </p><p>   China's state-backed media reacted with outrage in December after a lower-court judge granted bail to Mr. Lai shortly after his arrest. Mr. Lai, who also faces a fraud count, denies the charges. </p><p>   Hong Kong prosecutors appealed the bail decision to Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal and Mr. Lai was returned to jail on New Year's Eve awaiting a ruling. On Tuesday, a panel of five judges ruled that the lower-court judge had acted \"erroneously\" in granting bail and ordered Mr. Lai to remain in custody. </p><p>   Mr. Lai was one of several Hong Kong activists who traveled to Washington in 2019 to seek U.S. support for ongoing democracy protests in Hong Kong, and met with then-Vice President Mike Pence and other officials. The meetings enraged Beijing. Mr. Lai was first arrested on suspicion of foreign collusion in August 2020. About 200 police officers also raided the newsroom of his paper, Apple Daily. </p><p></p>",
