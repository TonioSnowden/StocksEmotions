  "title": "Putin steps in as energy crisis intensifies",
  "text": "<p>Good evening from London,</p> <p>There was some late afternoon drama today as Russian president Vladimir Putin said his country was prepared to step in and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e06c3b5d-153d-4c86-8c49-0d5447d58e76\">stabilise soaring energy prices</a>, which have rocked <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacb8ad4-ac88-403e-a7e4-ae99eab73473\">financial markets</a> and fuelled fears that the global economic recovery could be knocked off course.</p> <p>UK gas contracts for November delivery surged nearly 40 per cent as trading opened this morning to hit £4 per therm, having begun 2021 below 50p. But Putin's offer — aimed at fending off criticism from Europe that Russia was holding back supplies — saw markets dramatically change course, sending the price down to £2.87.</p> <p>Aside from the demand caused by economies emerging from the pandemic, traders have pointed to multiple reasons for the spike in prices, including the sharp fall in domestic production in Europe. The UK, which has very limited storage capacity, is especially vulnerable to higher energy costs.</p> <p>Investors meanwhile have been increasingly worried that the increases will feed through into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacb8ad4-ac88-403e-a7e4-ae99eab73473\">broader price rises</a> across the economy, with UK inflation expectations at their highest level since 2008. This has resulted in government bond prices falling as well as hurting equities because of the effect on company profits.</p> <p>In the EU, member states are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f2e46b3-ff05-4d31-b75c-7e77b6bde83c\">urging Brussels to take action</a> to halt the price rises, with some arguing that the Green Deal to make the bloc climate neutral by 2050 would only push up energy costs further and could lead to social unrest. One senior EU politician has warned that the Green Deal could become “the symbol of high energy prices and we will have instead of <em>gilets jaunes</em>, <em>gilets</em> [protesting over] energy poverty everywhere”.</p> <p>Putin also hit out at EU policy, blaming “poorly thought through decisions” by Brussels officials for creating “serious imbalances” in European energy markets. </p> <p>But the gas price rises in Europe are just one sign of a wider energy crunch that is playing out across the world, as consumer countries battle to secure fuel supplies. US oil prices this week hit their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccd6f6d6-6045-4f0c-8638-9b0e01fee1c5\">highest level in seven years</a> after Opec+ decided to maintain current production levels, while the price of coal topped its previous all-time peak set in 2008. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b790d504-b77f-4370-81e5-5ba0d16008bc\">China and India</a>, seen by the IMF as the two biggest drivers of global growth and both heavily reliant on coal, have been hit by severe power shortages. China has suffered a “triple whammy” of emissions restrictions on power generation, a shortage of coal and price caps on electricity that mean demand is unaffected as input costs go up. India, which relies heavily on coal for its thermal power plants, has just four days of stocks left.</p> <p>Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, has highlighted the global implications of the power shortages in China. “Global markets will feel the pinch of a shortage of supply from textiles [and] toys to machine parts . . . [and this will] very likely result in a shortage of goods for Thanksgiving and Christmas”, he said.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Poland raised interest rates <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/925b0c2c-c414-4b57-860c-5f75b8f18287#post-74c718d9-e6a1-4159-89c9-1e36c3cd2761\">for the first time in nine years</a> by 40 basis points to 0.5 per cent</p></li>  <li><p>Hiring by the US private sector added a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/925b0c2c-c414-4b57-860c-5f75b8f18287#post-aae4a43e-e5a3-4474-bc74-c2955afef93f\">higher than expected 568,000 jobs</a> in September, the biggest rise in three months</p></li>  <li><p>Only 37 per cent of people in Latin America and the Caribbean have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the Pan American Health Organization (Reuters)</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/925b0c2c-c414-4b57-860c-5f75b8f18287\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has outlined his plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e372f1b-1d7f-446e-82d1-6ead791ac181\">restructure the UK economy</a> in his keynote speech at the Tory party conference. The prime minister denied the country faced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/254587fc-2302-4154-adfc-1152a0b8e5ec\">supply chain crisis</a>, as his government pivoted from saying labour shortages had nothing to do with Brexit to saying they were a sign of Brexit success that signalled an end to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45863c4d-f08f-4dd4-a400-59e9a5dd903b\">cheap, foreign labour</a>. Meanwhile, pig farmers have started to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8f66162-c6bc-442f-baf5-ae98f7515dce\">cull healthy animals</a> as the government refuses to help with shortages at abattoirs.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>“Ouch, this one hurts” was the reaction of one analyst to this morning's data showing a sharp fall in <strong>German industrial orders</strong> in August thanks to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/925b0c2c-c414-4b57-860c-5f75b8f18287#post-b6005758-f4eb-4e94-b0fc-2160f3350be5\">supply chain problems</a> and surging inflation. Orders fell by 7.7 per cent, rather than the 2.1 per cent expected by economists. The German automotive sector was hit particularly hard — a problem echoed in the UK — as <strong>car sales</strong> fell to their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1df642a-dd66-4ce5-9357-7366cdc68078\">lowest level in two decades</a>.</p> <p>Aside from those industries badly hit by labour shortages, economists believe most <strong>British workers</strong> can only look forward to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/940e0ba1-485e-4a70-ba29-a966087b6f3b\">modest wage gains</a> in the near future and that any increases could be totally wiped out by inflation, write economics correspondent Delphine Strauss and chief political correspondent Jim Pickard.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>The US Senate will vote on the <strong>debt ceiling</strong> at 2pm ET (7pm London), with Democrats needing 10 Republicans to vote with them to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78586972-3088-47ad-b340-63a2a65510f8\">raise the country's borrowing limits</a>. Here's our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b5bd5e8-2662-48e4-b40f-f33b7d59ea66\">US debt ceiling explainer</a>.</p> <p>The IMF has said <strong>global growth</strong> this year would be lower than its earlier projection of 6 per cent as the impact of the pandemic continues to “hobble” the recovery, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0df3c871-2368-498c-8063-57d746e7b7f6#post-89778fda-d3f1-4544-ae00-dd4f19cda112\">unequal access to vaccines</a> being the most pressing problem. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said the fund's key message was “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41574d13-8e36-43c7-8dd6-ac3dc9be5a72\">vaccinate, calibrate and accelerate</a>”. </p> <p><strong>New Zealand</strong> became the third developed economy to raise interest rates since the pandemic began, with a 25 basis points <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d41796d-6330-40d8-b67a-34a2e3b31a90\">increase to 0.5 per cent</a>. The decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand follows recent moves to increase rates in South Korea and Norway, as inflationary concerns begin to take hold as growth returns. The fear of <strong>stagflation</strong>, where inflation increases and growth slows, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35b9b640-8b44-4f4b-b03c-40cd2fff2cfd\">haunting central banks</a> across the world. </p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p><strong>Tesco</strong>, the UK's largest food retailer, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/436fb11b-3884-4663-b64c-05be8e4b0201\">raised expectations for full-year profits</a> to £2.5bn-£2.6bn and announced a £500m share buyback, as it reported a 29 per cent rise in first-half operating profits.</p> <p>Ecommerce giant <strong>Amazon</strong> has opened its first “4-star” UK store at the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, selling items that have received favourable customer reviews on its website.</p> <p>Nearly half of UK staff have <strong>returned to the office</strong> at least on a part-time basis, according to a survey carried out for the FT, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0c6e4f7-4d5d-477d-9ac7-fc74e8391075\">growth is plateauing</a> as workers remain worried about coronavirus infection and companies consolidate remote working practices. </p> <p>Manufacturers have warned that the continuing disruption of <strong>energy supplies</strong> in China would severely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbdd0fb0-9ac6-47b5-ad2f-2c23e8245e92\">damage tech supply chains</a>, just as companies such as Apple gear up for peak production season. US plans to combat the global <strong>semiconductor shortage</strong> are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36192845-2f17-46ed-b273-3c5c5ff4e4b9\">unlikely to have much impact</a>, writes Greater China correspondent Kathrin Hille.</p> <p><strong>Tui</strong>, the world's largest package holiday operator, plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4f4a87c-d185-4301-934a-d49ce77cd94b\">raise €1.1bn</a> by selling new shares, in a sign of confidence in the travel industry as it emerges from pandemic disruption. The Anglo-German group said it had taken 5.2m bookings this summer, about 1.1m more than it had expected just two months ago. </p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>The pandemic boom in dealmaking has taken its toll on staff at law firms, which are now launching wellbeing programmes and even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9477e38a-a1e2-48b9-b2c8-6689465a77ec\">hiring “burnout advisers”</a> in response. Mental health charity LawCare said wellness programmes would not succeed without radical changes in an office culture with long hours, a lack of management support and poor boundaries between work and home life.</p> <p>Why do we always feel so short of time even though we work fewer hours than previous generations? <strong>Sarah O' Connor</strong> examines the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9df289b9-d425-49e6-899f-c963b458625f\">mysterious decline of leisure time</a> and the decades-long trend of “time poverty”.</p> <p>Forget the brown-nosing and humblebragging. Newly blurred boundaries between work and home life during the pandemic have helped drive a new trend towards <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d910754-3568-412c-8a10-9e4806a83b11\">more “honest” posts</a> on networking site <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, writes Emma Jacobs.</p> <p><em>Sign up to watch the </em><a href=\"https://digitalfutureofwork.live.ft.com/page/1735671/register-to-watch-vod\"><em>video on demand</em></a><em> of all sessions of FT Live's Future of Work event, which featured company leaders ranging from LinkedIn and AstraZeneca to Nasa and the Bank of America.
