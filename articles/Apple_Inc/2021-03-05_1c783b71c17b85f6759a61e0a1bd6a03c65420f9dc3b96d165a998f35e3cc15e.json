  "text": "<p>Margrethe Vestager had a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a36847-c846-4666-b8b9-65943f5361ee\">turbulent 2020</a>. </p> <p>The Dane, who is in charge of the EU's competition and digital policy, lost some of her shine last year when Brussels was defeated in a bruising tax battle against Ireland and Apple before the EU's General Court.&#xa0;</p> <p>EU judges ruled against Vestager and told Brussels it hadn't done its homework to show that Ireland had given the tech giant unfair tax advantages to the tune of €14.3bn.</p> <p>It was a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cc18c26-04e0-410d-9c0a-3f1baf1a1685\">blow for Vestager</a>, who has been the architect of Brussels' use of powerful competition tools to crack down on tax arrangements for Big Tech companies that it considers illegal state aid.</p> <p>But there was a glimmer of hope for the EU's competition supremo after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b6aa26f-f2ac-426f-b218-612f4c21695c\">Brussels scored</a> a welcome legal victory in a state aid case involving Spain on Thursday.</p> <p>The European Court of Justice ruled in favour of the commission, saying that tax deals provided to some of the richest football clubs in the world, including FC Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain, were illegal after all.</p> <p>The win was a boon for EU regulators who want to stop some of the world's most lucrative football clubs from free riding at the expense of EU taxpayers.</p> <p>As in the Apple case, the commission lost on the information it provided to make its argument about football clubs benefiting from tax schemes, but the court ultimately upheld the principle that the arrangements could qualify as illegal state aid. It is this that has led some state aid experts to suggest that playing the long game might vindicate Vestager.</p> <p>“When Brussels loses these cases it is important to look behind the headlines and to see whether the principle has been accepted and whether they just lost on the quality of the evidence that they were able to provide,” says James Webber, a partner at the law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling.</p> <p>“The commission might lose on a few details but they are increasingly winning on the principles. This may happen on the Apple case too,” he added.</p> <p>There are more reasons to believe that all is not lost for the star commissioner. The ECJ operates as an independent court and often gives rulings that permanently override those of the lower General Court — as was the case with the state aid decisions on Spanish football clubs.</p> <p>“The ECJ has shown itself willing to take an independent view. It's very far from a rubber stamp of the lower court,” says Alec Burnside, a Brussels-based partner at law firm Dechert.</p> <p>Vestager has stayed defiant and is opening renewed competition battles with Big Tech. The EU is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d37c476c-b4cd-4b47-9ed2-d19ad2341ea8\">set to charge Apple</a> for the first time over concerns of anti-competitive behaviour related to its App Store.</p> <p>It is too early to say what may come of the antitrust case or the war of attrition against Apple. But they are unlikely to be Vestager's last salvos against Big Tech.</p> <h1>Chart du jour: gold loses its sparkle</h1> <p>Gold is losing its shine for investors, with its price dropping to its lowest level in a year. The fall in the fortunes of gold and a rally in global stocks suggest investors are encouraged by strong stimulus measures from central banks. A lower price in gold might not be all bad news. The price fall could mean a pick-up in demand for physical gold in India and China, the largest consumers of the metal.
