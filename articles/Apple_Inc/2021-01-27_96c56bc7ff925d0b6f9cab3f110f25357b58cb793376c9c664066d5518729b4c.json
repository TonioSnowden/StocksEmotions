  "text": "<p>Stanley Tollman's instructions were clear. Build a safari lodge in Botswana's Okavango Delta and make it the finest of its kind in the world. </p> <p>“The brief was simple,” says Anton De Kock, the architect engaged for the task. “Mr Tollman said, ‘I want an extraordinary camp. I want an extraordinary experience.' That was the word: ‘extraordinary'. And knowing Mr T, it had to be the best of the best.” </p> <p>Tollman, a South African hospitality magnate whose Travel Corporation employs 10,000 people in 70 countries, mused a little more. Each of the 12 suites must have air-conditioning and constant hot water. The lodge must not be decorated in the drab khaki and beige typical of African safari camps. It should be colourful and titillate the eye, with at least a splash of red in every room. There must be a fountain. There should be no black. It should look like a safari lodge, but not too much. There should be an air-conditioned library. And a fabulous bar. And an orientation map of the camp. And, oh yes, some sort of nod to Africa's “big five” animals. Apart from that, he hardly said a word. </p> <p>The mammoth endeavour, a Versailles in the African bush, was to mark Tollman's 90th birthday. Over his lifetime, together with his wife Beatrice, he had built a vast travel empire from the small family business begun in 1920 when his father, a Lithuanian refugee, opened a hotel in Paternoster, a fishing village on South Africa's west coast. Today the group comprises 40 brands, including Uniworld, Contiki, Trafalgar and Red Carnation Hotels, the latter named after the flower Tollman wears habitually in his lapel. The lodge was to be his legacy, a monument to a life in travel. </p> <p>Money was no object. The budget for the 12-room camp, which will accommodate a maximum of 24 guests, was $30m. </p> <p>The task of fulfilling the patriarch's vision fell principally to Antoinette (“Toni”) Tollman, his elder daughter, who oversees design at the family's luxury brands. As well as building the grandest lodge in Africa, she wanted to fill it with contemporary artwork and design. Four years after embarking on the mission, she describes the experience as “like giving birth to a rhinoceros”. Xigera, as the lodge is called, finally opened last month.</p>  <p><strong>You get to Xigera </strong>by bush plane from Maun in the north of Botswana, landing at a warthog-patrolled airstrip a short distance from the camp. I was one of the very first to see it. The moment I caught my first glimpse of the lodge on the empty floodplains, I thought of the Werner Herzog film <em>Fitzcarraldo</em>. </p> <p>In the 1980s epic, starring an insane-looking Klaus Kinski, an Irish would-be rubber-baron sets about the task of hauling a 320-tonne, three-deck steamer over a steep and steamy Peruvian mountain. The film's recreation of the madcap endeavour was so realistic it provoked revolts among the actors and clashes with the local population. A Peruvian logger hired to help in the production was bitten by a venomous snake and sawed his leg off with a chainsaw to stop the spreading poison. In taking on the challenge, Herzog declared himself “Conquistador of the Useless”. </p> <p>Building Xigera lodge, a palace of wood, steel and glass two days by barge from the nearest town, did not rise to that level of insanity. Still, it came pretty close. Everything, from the charred <em>shou sugi ban</em> Japanese cladding to the solar power station on which the camp would run, had to be brought to the middle of the delta, a process made marginally easier by a drought that turned river beds into bumpy roads. </p> <p>Toni Tollman had a plan for Xigera, pronounced roughly “Kee-jera”, unless you can do the click sound common to many southern African languages. But she had to adapt to her father's flights of inspiration. Take the time when, attending his granddaughter's wedding in Marrakesh, Tollman's eye alighted on a gargantuan chandelier, a blaze of light and brass suspended like a deadweight from a restaurant ceiling. You can almost see his daughter's face as he mouthed the words: “That would look good at Xigera.” </p> <p>Toni commissioned three and threw a Moroccan carpet from a nearby souk into the bargain. “There were certain things he wanted and I had to see how we could work it in,” she says. </p> <p>A Marrakechi craftsman took 18 months to make the mammoth lanterns. Moving them to Xigera in the midst of Covid-19 took another year. First they were flown to London in a specially designed crate — a logistical detail the craftsman had overlooked — then to Amsterdam and then to Johannesburg, before being trucked to Maun. Too delicate for the final stretch of road, they were floated up by barge. Now one hangs in the lounge, above two curvaceous blood-red leather sofas, and two in the dining room from a reinforced ceiling. </p> <p>De Kock had previously redesigned Durban's The Oyster Box Hotel, another Tollman family property, bought to celebrate a dinner date. (Not that long ago, Stanley Tollman bought Ashford castle in Ireland to commemorate the time his son first caught a trout.) But De Kock had never done a safari camp. “Tents make me nervous,” he says. For inspiration, he took a trip by dug-out canoe, known locally as <em>mekoro</em>, along the waterways — an experience now offered to guests. </p> <p>“The first thing I saw were these amazing water lilies,” he says of the white-and-yellow flowers that open with daisy-like abundance in the waterlogged floodplains. “When you look at a lily quite close up it becomes an incredible object, an experience of nature in its absolute beauty and perfection.” The flower became a central motif of Xigera, from the massive copper fireplace to the candleholders in the dining room and the decorative finials on the uprights of the four-poster beds. </p> <p>“Then there were all these birds: pelicans, marabou storks, kingfishers,” says De Kock, who decided to incorporate the idea of flight into his design. Xigera, in the language of the Bayei river people, refers to the action of the pied kingfisher as it hovers like a helicopter before diving for fish. He had originally wanted to cover the roofs in very un-safari copper, but relented when the Tollmans insisted on traditional canvas. The tent roofs, he says, enhance the concept of a bird on the wing. </p> <p>After all the building materials had been flown, trucked or barged in, they had to be assembled. Three hundred workers and craftsmen lived on site, their movements strictly regulated once Covid-19 struck. </p> <p>Inevitably, there were setbacks. Suite Two was a story on its own. One night, it caught a spark from a welder's torch and workmen returned the next morning to find its smouldering embers. It was resurrected, but only months before the scheduled finish a leopard moved in. Work was halted while she nursed her two cubs in what is now the mirrored dressing room. Philip Fourie, the project manager, silently cursed the spotted show-stopper until one day when mother and offspring slipped into the bush. The cubs, sometimes spied on game drives, are informally named “Suite Two One” and “Suite Two Two”. </p> <p>Fire and fur defeated, Toni had to decorate Suite Two — and all the other suites besides, not to mention the lobby, dining areas and decks. She collaborated with Southern Guild, a Cape Town gallery of contemporary design, to assemble a roster of 80 mainly African artists and designers. Their pieces, many commissioned specifically for Xigera, were to form a sort of living art gallery where guests, instead of admiring the exhibits, sit on them, drink from them, dine on them, sleep on them and, in the case of the copper-plated bathtub, wallow in them. My favourite was the decadently comfortable human-sized nest woven from cane by South African artist Porky Hefer, an act of bio-mimicry he gleaned (I'd say stole) from weaver birds. </p> <p>The lodge's 12 apartment-sized suites are secreted beneath the canopy of a riverine forest, connected by 1.8km of raised wooden walkways in light garapa hardwood. The gentle lines of the wood lend a Japanese simplicity to a lodge otherwise jammed with objets d'art, and a walk on the decking is one of Xigera's great pleasures. At night, the walkway is discreetly lit with LEDs, affording glimpses of nature including, on one thrilling post-prandial stroll, a spotted genet nestled in a tree. </p> <p>Much of the design nods to the surrounding landscape, though you hardly need reminding given the constant chatter of birds, the trampolining of baboons on the tarpaulin roof and, at night, the thunderous thrum of frogs and toads. In my room, antelopes bounded from the bedside lamps, giant cheetah nestled in the chair fabric and fan palms were etched into the drinks cabinet. Even the shower floor had a lily-pad design cast in bronze. </p>  <p><strong>All this luxury might</strong> seem excessive, but to be fair, it is in line with the Botswana government's own strategy of attracting a very small number of very high-spending tourists. It will take 106 employees — almost all local, according to government regulations — to keep Xigera running, and the camp is committed to sourcing much of its food and other supplies from local farmers and businesses. </p> <p>For staff, there's the constant task of keeping nature at bay: cleaning up after the baboons, removing the bright-orange jackalberry stains from the lightwood decking, and battening down the defences when storms blow in.</p> <p>The guests may turn out to be more demanding still. In the morning there are juices to press, bread to bake and eggs to poach. There's a three-course lunch to serve and an afternoon tea — cucumber sandwiches, scones and all — to prepare. There are cocktails from the bar, with its punkah-style rattan fans and selection of botanical gins. And in the evening there is Botswana's grass-fed beef to barbecue, weather permitting in the open-air boma whose most striking feature are the two-and-a-half metre firepit sculptures by South African blacksmith-artist Conrad Hicks. </p> <p>With so much visual and epicurean distraction, guests might struggle to move outside the camp, situated in a pristine spot on the Moremi Game Reserve. That would be an error. Xigera affords the chance to see the wildlife of the delta both from the water and the land. The landscape is dotted with fan palms, which lends it a hint of south-east Asia. Herds of red-coated lechwe antelope, adapted to the wetlands, splash in lovely motion through the water. Even the hyenas have learnt to catch giant catfish. On land, termite mounds silhouette the horizon like cathedrals of the floodplain, forming little island ecosystems and lookout posts for baboons and leopards. </p> <p>On one afternoon game drive in a cream-coloured safari vehicle — “no beige, no khaki” — we followed the handsomest of lions as he stalked through the long grass. Later we came upon a leopard halfway through a meal of vervet monkey, a sight both riveting and horrifying. </p> <p>If you've not had enough of nature, guests can choose to sleep out one night in a baobab treehouse, an extraordinary three-tiered construction of steel and mesh. It is not exactly hardship. The lighthouse-like interior, with its lantern-lit winding staircase, is fitted with a hot shower, twin-basin bathroom and a large double bed. Dinner and bottles of wine from the Tollmans' South African estate are laid out in welcome. Glass in hand, you can lie on the rooftop deck, watching the blaze of stars and listening to the delta's night-time cacophony. </p> <p>As Botswana cautiously reopened its borders in November and the lodge's inauguration approached, Toni took stock. She had, she felt, fulfilled her father's every wish, even if she had at times bent his preferences to her own predilections. (In the cladding and flooring, she had even smuggled in a little black.)</p> <p>The fountain was there, though the modernist, bubbling black pillars might not have been exactly what papa had intended. The big five were hardly traditional, rendered as mask-like busts in patinated bronze by Otto du Plessis. Even the guide's map of the concession became a work of art: a wenge-wood table with rivers, pools and animals marked out in inlaid metal. </p> <p>By December 13, there was nothing else to do. Mr and Mrs Tollman arrived. They occupied the Xigera Family Suite. In their lounge hung a woodblock of a nude by Cecil Skotnes, the late South African artist, bought at auction by Tollman himself. </p> <p>“He's a hard taskmaster,” says Toni of her father. “He doesn't hand out compliments easily.” Yet in the end, the patriarch was rendered almost speechless. He pronounced Xigera “perfect”, though he only stayed one night.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/david-pilling\"><em>David Pilling</em></a><em> is the FT's Africa Editor </em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
