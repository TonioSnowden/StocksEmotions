  "text": "<p>Consolidation in the delivery sector right now is as much about amassing every kind of service as merging with a rival.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b961f11-5228-4d59-ae1e-14e819677325\">Uber's earnings last week</a> showed that as well as delivering more people to their destinations, its Uber Eats and fast-groceries services were also doing well. DoorDash, the leading meal courier service in the US, reports after the market close and is now aiming to compete with Amazon on logistics, expanding into delivering in other verticals such as flowers, home goods, convenience store items and groceries, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/newsletters/fully-charged/latest\">says Bloomberg</a>.</p> <p>On the merger front, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/doordash-recently-held-talks-to-buy-instacart\">DoorDash held talks recently</a> to buy grocery delivery service Instacart for between $40bn and $50bn, according to The Information. They collapsed partly due to fears about an antitrust investigation, given the amount of consolidation that has been taking place.</p> <p>Geographic expansion gets around competition concerns and DoorDash is preparing to make its first investment in Europe by<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cccd541-0a44-4002-af6e-35fe7ef46445\"> taking a stake </a>in Berlin's grocery delivery app Gorillas. The US's Gopuff has been actually buying companies in Europe. The rapid grocery delivery company entered the continent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0db992c6-acb1-437f-bd5b-7d73c81b4a04\">by buying Fancy </a>of the UK in May. Today it said it had<a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/london-grocery-delivery-app-dija-snapped-up-by-rival-gopuff/\"> acquired&#xa0;Dija </a>to establish an immediate presence in France and Spain and provide further coverage in the UK.&#xa0;</p> <p>Dija is run by executives formerly with Deliveroo, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d91c37d-ad9a-4c8d-9998-6826441ac7e4\">reported yesterday </a>that food orders doubled in its latest quarter. Today its German rival Delivery Hero reported its quarterly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/delivery-hero-hikes-2021-outlook-strong-q2-2021-08-12/\">revenues more than doubled</a> on continued strong demand for its food and rapid delivery services. It has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90f5ef42-fe8b-4b09-a388-477cb1918d18\">built a 5 per cent stake </a>in Deliveroo since April, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/niklasoestberg/status/1425738201482858497\">CEO Niklas Oestberg tweeted</a> about his counterpart today: “Tremendous respect for Will Shu and Deliveroo but at this point in time we have no intention or wish to acquire the company. Simply a happy shareholder.” The subtext there seems to be that too much consolidation too soon in the fast-moving food delivery sector is likely to cause indigestion.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Turkey's tech star rises</strong><br>The idea for rapid grocery delivery services <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87cd997e-534a-4b9c-94ce-8ee419efe184\">began in Turkey with Getir</a>. And that's not all the tech start-up innovation and investment happening there. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1010e729-a33f-4fd8-acd6-e5391bca45e0\">Tim Bradshaw has been surveying the scene.</a></p> <p><strong>2. UK tells Facebook to unwind Giphy deal</strong><br>The UK competition regulator has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a39f3734-651e-40da-a3af-1ffe441e296d\">called for Facebook to sell </a>online image platform Giphy, which it&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27af7fff-8d44-4378-b90f-d0f83c66b00e\">bought for $400m</a>&#xa0;last year, after provisionally finding competition concerns following an in-depth investigation.</p> <p><strong>3. Reddit reaches $10bn in latest round</strong><br>Reddit, the online discussion forum whose users roiled US stock markets earlier this year with their ‘meme stock' investment tips, is experiencing its own valuation spike with a new financing round<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0029521a-0cb1-400b-9723-a248b4d3ff2d\"> putting its worth at $10bn.</a> Led by Fidelity Investments, the up to $700m tranche lifts Reddit's valuation by 67 per cent since its last round in February. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>4. Foxconn reports record revenues</strong><br>Apple supplier Foxconn reported a 30 per cent year-on-year jump in net profit for the second quarter on the back of strong demand for smartphones and computing products. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95572017-1622-4bff-8be6-d219f116e80f\">Revenues were up 20 per cent</a> to a new high for the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer.</p> <p><strong>5. Workers' code of misconduct</strong><br>Employees are taking sensitive computer code from their own companies at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7a2b5c4-1653-4364-84c1-c322c5b56745\">three times the rate</a> they were a year ago, according to new research into so-called insider threats, as record numbers of disgruntled workers quit their jobs with pandemic restrictions easing. An analysis of data of 700,000 company devices by the cyber security group Code42 found that there were about 65m attempts made by staff to exfiltrate source code from their corporate network in the three months to the end of June, up from about 20m in each of the previous three quarters.</p> <h2>Forwarded from&#xa0;Sifted&#xa0;—&#xa0;the European start-up week</h2> <p>In European start-up news this week, Sifted looks at the people who have the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/n26-power-players/\">real power at Berlin-based digital bank N26</a>; the rise of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/fintechs-target-influencers/\">fintech companies specifically aimed at influencers</a>; and how&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/data-war-china/\">militaries around the world</a>&#xa0;are looking to work with tech start-ups.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Tech tools — Honor Magic3</h2> <p>Honor has followed Xiaomi and Samsung with major smartphone announcements this week. The Chinese company gave details today of its first flagship devices since being&#xa0;sold off by former parent company Huawei. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621367/honor-magic-3-pro-plus-price-specs-features-cameras?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4\">The Verge reports </a>the line-up consists of the <a href=\"https://www.hihonor.com/global/products/smartphone/honor-magic3-pro-plus/\">Magic3, Magic3 Pro, and Magic3 Pro+, </a>available in China first with a global release later.</p> <p>Separating from Huawei means Honor can include regular Google apps and services that had been denied its parent due to US sanctions. The cameras look impressive, particularly on the Pro+ (pictured), which features a 64MP periscopic telephoto camera. The phones will start at around $1,000.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Delivery services take new order' FT.com 12 August.
