  "title": "OFF DUTY --- The Grand Outdoors Issue: Eating & Drinking: Picnic Passionately --- One of the world's great boxed-lunch traditions, Korean doshirak is the kind of meal we crave now: practical, portable and pleasing to all the senses",
  "text": "<p>A popular vegan option, Temple Tangsu, consists of fried pyogo mushrooms with a dusting of savory dried doenjang (fermented soybean paste). Inspired by Korean temple food, the dish has special significance for the couple, who met at a Buddhist temple. A banchan of spicy tuna nods to a canned version popular in Korea that both Mr. Uh and Ms. Park ate as children. \"[Kwang] and his father would go on weekly hikes, and his dad would whip out this can of tuna in the forest,\" said Ms. Park. \"My family and I would be on a boat and bust them out. It evokes memories of outdoor excursions for us.\"</p><p>With the pandemic pushing restaurants to rethink to-go containers for outdoor dining as well as take-out, many Korean chefs stateside have seized on the boxed lunch. \"Doshirak is so naturally fitting for takeaway,\" said Peter Cho of Han Oak and Toki restaurants in Portland, Ore. \"Korean dining is communal and sharing, which is hard to have these days.\" Mr. Cho added that doshiraks allow each guest to try different parts of the menu at once.</p><p>\"It just lends itself to the times,\" Mr. Cho said. \"Because you get this compartmentalized container, it's nice to be able to pair the different kimchi, kakduki, baechu kimchi and pickles. For me, all the food that we've done is closely tied to my personal experience.\"</p><p>Doshiraks are trending in Korea, too. A variety of boxed meals can be found at major convenience stores including 7-Eleven and GS25, and Korean celebrity chefs such Baek Jong-won have lent their famous faces to the labels of mass-market boxes. Yet for many, doshirak remains a taste of home.</p><p>\"For me, it's this comforting feeling or language,\" said New York chef Susan Kim, who launched a pop-up called Doshi (short for doshirak) last year. \"There's a history of doshirak in Korea that people are still returning to. I think, at the root of it, there's a comforting nostalgia.\"</p><p>While Ms. Kim had been developing her business concept for a couple years, the coronavirus lockdown provided new impetus and opportunities. Local restaurants were in flux, opening and closing with revised regulations. The owners of Brooklyn's Hunky Dory, for example, were able to make their kitchen available for one of the pop-ups last fall.</p><p>The Doshi menu and the recipes Ms. Kim shares here reflect her wide-ranging experience as a Korean immigrant growing up in Southern California and working in notable Bay Area kitchens. Her sesame-oil pickles speak equally to her Korean heritage and her love for Italian giardiniera. Her time at Berkeley's legendary Chez Panisse shows in her market-driven spring salad of asparagus, sugar snap peas and fava beans with a pine nut tofu dressing.</p><p>For family and friends meeting up again after an extended hibernation, doshiraks offer a beautiful way to share a meal, packed up elegantly in individual servings, portable to any outdoor activity. \"You do see the jeong,\" said Ms. Kim, using the Korean word for a profound feeling of shared warmth and connection. \"You see the love in the way doshiraks have been crafted.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Doenjang Steak</p><p>Total Time: 40 minutes</p><p>Serves: 4</p><p>3 tablespoons grapeseed oil</p><p>1/3 cup doenjang</p><p>2 tablespoons maple syrup</p><p>3 tablespoons spicy mustard</p><p>1 tablespoon fish sauce</p><p>1 teaspoon salt</p><p>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</p><p>1/3 cup water</p><p>1 pound skirt steak, cut in 6-inch slabs</p><p>1.
