  "text": "<p>I'm trying hard to figure out what's going on here. Previously, scams from crooks trying to pass themselves off as marketers representing Amazon or Apple or Chase Bank were sleek and professional-looking, with no obvious typos or grammatical errors. Somebody out there in the darkest corners of the evilsphere at least used some form of spell checker before clicking the \"Send\" button. The messages they crafted looked legitimate, making it easy for people to fall for them. As many did. But now all I get is idiotic gibberish from people who can't spell.</p><p>There are two possible explanations for this baffling phenomenon. One is amusing and perhaps even encouraging; the other one is horrifying. Looking on the bright side, the fact that all my spam seems to have been written by illiterates suggests that all the smart, orthographically unchallenged criminals have abandoned the field because no one is falling for their ruses anymore. The public has gradually learned that banks and credit card companies never ask for your password and that nobody, but nobody, will ever send you a Samsung 8 for free just because you responded to a customer survey. Or because you were a nice person.</p><p>An awful lot of people have learned the hard way that the more professional an unsolicited communication seems, the more likely it is to be fake. All of which seems to suggest that all the classy, literate, upmarket crooks have thrown in the towel and moved on to other pursuits. And if it's true that all the scamsters who can spell \"cat\" without any help from Mommy have abandoned the field, that is good news for all of us.</p><p>But then there's the second possible explanation for the Attack of the Killer Cacographers, and this is not good news at all. What if scamsters have figured out through trial and error that an awful lot of Americans think that \"Thank uu\" is actually spelled that way, as is \"Surpriiisee,\" making them much more likely to view these messages as authentic. Because of the dismal state of our educational system, a lot of people are likely to immediately delete a message reading \"Thank you for your support!!\" but will respond to an email reading \"THAANK YOUU, CVVS!!\" because everyone knows that the letters \"TH\" are always followed by two vowels. Aren't theey?</p><p>If this is the case, if American orthography has fallen into such a deep trough, then it means that we as a people need to have a serious national conversation about spelling. If only out of concern for public safety, the powers-that-be should start thinking about re-lettering signs and official communications in spelling arrangements that the public can understand. That means lots and lots of bright red \"STOPP\" signs and warnings that \"WRITE LANE DISAAAAPPPEARS IN 100 YAARDS.\" It means that if the IRS wants anyone to pay attention to its missives, it should start sending out letters under the rubric IRESS. It means signs reading \"NOH TURN ONN READ\" and \"BRIDGET FREEEZES B4 ROWED.\"</p><p>It means that the public should start shopping at Hole Foods and Alple. And it means that from now on, when June rolls around the public will get a chance to watch the MBA Fiinals. In the words of Jack's Son Brown, \"Ddon't tink it can't halpen just becauuse it haasn't halpened yett.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
