  "title": "Mr Corman is a slow-burn story of modern life on Apple TV Plus",
  "text": "<p>Who is Mr Corman? Part of the problem is he doesn't know himself. He's half-Jewish, which makes him half anti-Semitic, according to his mother. He was in the music business but now he teaches fifth grade and only sings in his car. Enmeshed in a routine of gaming, napping on the couch and eating fast food at the kitchen table, he feels incomplete without former girlfriend Megan, and ordinary life in LA fills him with profound dread.&#xa0;</p> <p>Writer-director Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also stars as Josh Corman, takes the slow-burn approach to narrative, with the result that the first two of the 10 episodes (singles follow weekly) give scant indication of where this is headed, or even what type of vehicle this is. The riddling approach matches our confused era with its mish-mash of real and virtual life, its ever-intensifying connection married with ever-increasing loneliness. The pandemic gets a look-in, too. Josh's interiority is signalled by many close-ups of Gordon-Levitt's unsmiling face. When he ventures beyond the bright colours and established facts of the classroom, he dissolves into inconsequence.&#xa0;</p> <p>In episode one he picks up a worrisomely volatile date, though perhaps she's NFLA (Normal For . . .). Even if he were not prone to overthinking, it probably wouldn't have gone well. Emotional support is forthcoming from his sweet-natured flatmate, UPS delivery guy Victor (Arturo Castro), whose eternal cheerfulness is a cover for sadness. Victor deservedly gets his own adorable episode in “Mr Morales”. Stray observations resonate far beyond their immediate context. It's no coincidence that a visiting art teacher leads Josh's pupils in a mask-making workshop. “From dark times comes great art,” Josh tells her glibly, while a caustic Zoom date insists that miracles are fake by definition, when a miracle is exactly what Josh needs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Watchable guest stars include Debra Winger as Ruth Corman, Josh's mother, Juno Temple as Megan and an unhinged turn from Lucy Lawless (<em>Xena: Warrior Princess</em>). Interspersing the bursts of realism are <em>Donnie Darko</em>-like hints of another dimension, such as the burning meteorite in the sky that no one seems to see, the clanging of an invisible bell, and the visual flares that occur whenever Josh glimpses a mysterious vagrant.</p> <p>As director, Gordon-Levitt switches fluently from the macro to the micro, from Instagram to astronomy, a global pandemic to one person's unshakeable unease. He throws in styles and genre sequences — a song and dance routine, a combat video game — then chucks them out again like a toddler tired with a toy. You might not see anything more forlorn all year than Josh dressed as a blue cartoon dog making his way through a crowd of Halloween revellers. It's clever, but much more peculiar than ha ha.&#xa0;</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>Out now on Apple TV Plus</em></p><p>Source: Suzi Feay 2021 'Mr Corman is a slow-burn story of modern life on Apple TV Plus' FT.com 3 August.
