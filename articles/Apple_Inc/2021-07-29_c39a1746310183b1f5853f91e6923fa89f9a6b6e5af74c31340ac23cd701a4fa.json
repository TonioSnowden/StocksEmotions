  "text": "<p>The Archegos fallout poses more questions than it answers (“Credit Suisse hit by fallout from Archegos and Greensill scandals”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef996142-e5dd-45ae-9008-fc4cbd8c291d\">FT.com</a>, July 29).</p> <p>When some of the world's largest investment banks help a controversial fund manager make numerous large leveraged bets less than a decade on from his part in an insider trading scheme, questions were bound to crop up.</p> <p>Archegos wanted to take large secretive positions in media firm Viacom via the use of derivatives called total return swaps. But how many of these swap positions are involved in the trading of larger companies, and just how many funds are left holding cash equity positions that act as misdirection to mask trades that are the exact opposite of the position? Just how many FTSE and S&amp;P companies are underpinned by these swaps? And how can the wider investment community believe what they see on regulatory filings about these companies?</p> <p>After all, there is no small print on an SEC filing that says, “please note, there may well be a much bigger bet on Apple's share price falling sharply.” Carrying out a total return swap for a small cap stock is one thing, but it is unknown as to how many of these swap positions are being placed on blue-chip companies that the wider marker has absolutely no idea about. Is it a case of the bigger the name, the bigger risk? Who knows, but one thing is for certain, it would be a brave firm that decides against carrying out a root and branch review into the context around their swap trades as the post-Archegos analysis continues.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Blower</strong> <br><em>Chief Executive, VoxSmart <br>London EC2, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Archegos fallout puts swap trades in spotlight' FT.com 29 July.
