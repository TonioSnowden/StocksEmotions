  "text": "<p>It's a free, once-a-day word game that has gone viral in the past few weeks. It can be played only on a website.</p><p>Who brought this on us?</p><p>Wordle was created by Josh Wardle, a software engineer from New York. He created a prototype in 2013 and dusted it off during the pandemic for his partner, who likes word games.</p><p>How do I play?</p><p>Go to the game's website on your desktop or mobile browser. The URL is: https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ </p><p>Wordle is simple: You have six chances to guess the secret five-letter word. Type in a word as a guess; the game tells you which letters are or aren't in the word. The aim is to figure out the secret word with the fewest guesses.</p><p>What do the green and yellow squares mean?</p><p>When you make a guess, the letter tiles change color to show how close you are to the secret word. If you guess \"weary,\" and the \"W\" turns green, that means the secret word starts with a \"W.\" If the \"E\" turns yellow, the letter is in the word but not in that spot. Any letters that aren't in the secret word turn gray.</p><p>Is there an app?</p><p>No. It can be played only on the game's website, and the creator said he doesn't plan on turning it into an app.</p><p>But that didn't stop others from making their own copycat games. Bogus Wordle apps filled Apple Inc.'s App Store in the past week, rising to the top of the \"most downloaded\" lists. But Apple said Tuesday night that it removed those apps.</p><p>How big is the viral craze?</p><p>Some 1.8 million people played on Jan. 7, Mr. Wardle said, whereas just 90 played on Nov. 1, 2021.</p><p>Why is it just once a day?</p><p>The once-daily aspect helped the game go viral. Since everyone in the world gets the same Wordle game at midnight in their time zone, it enables players to talk to each other about how they did. \"It becomes a shared experience,\" Mr. Wardle said.</p><p>Can I play more than once daily?</p><p>Some players have figured out a way to do that: They use the Wayback Machine, an online internet archive where you can go to Wordle's website from past days and play old games.</p><p>How did Wordle go viral?</p><p>Mr. Wardle said the game started to take off in mid-November, when technologist Andy Baio put a link to the game in his blog. Mr. Wardle then made it easy to share results by posting the green and yellow squares on Facebook, Twitter and texting apps, and the game went viral from there.</p><p>\"The Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon has tweeted repeatedly about the game, helping fuel its popularity.</p><p>Some tips and tricks?</p><p>There's plenty debate among fans on the best way to play.</p><p>Avid players typically have a favorite first word they think gets them to the answer fastest. Two groups have emerged: those who type in vowel-heavy words first, such as \"adieu\" or \"arose,\" and those who go after common consonants with words such as \"stare.\"</p><p>Some have even created spreadsheets to figure out the most commonly occurring letters in five-letter words. One player determined that those are E, S, A, R and O and opted to use \"arose\" as his first guess.</p><p>Others just wing it and type whatever comes to their mind. If you're looking for strategies, try finding a Wordle Facebook group like WORDLE Friends, where people are sharing tips.</p><p>Mr. Wardle himself said he doesn't know the best strategy. \"You're asking the wrong person,\" he said. \"I'm very bad at it.\"</p>",
