  "text": "<p>   This past Thursday, Sony Music confirmed that it had purchased Bruce Springsteen's recorded music and publishing catalog. The price of the sale -- which transfers ownership of both the Boss's master recordings, i.e. his performances as found on his records, and publishing rights to the songs he has written -- was reported to be about $550 million. It was the most recent -- and, by some measures, most lucrative -- instance of a high-profile, late-career artist selling the rights to his or her songs. Other notable examples from the past 12 months, which were reported to be worth between $50 million and $400 million, include Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Neil Young, ZZ Top and Stevie Nicks (her onetime Fleetwood Mac bandmate Lindsey Buckingham sold his songs too, price unknown). And negotiations for the sale of song catalogs of Sting and David Bowie are rumored to be in the works. </p><p>   The companies buying the songs include music publishers like Primary Wave and Hipgnosis, often working in partnership with investors, along with the publishing arms of major labels including Universal, Warner, and Sony, which owns Mr. Springsteen's longtime label, Columbia. There are basic economic reasons why these transactions are happening now -- low interest rates make borrowing easy for the buyers, potential changes to the capital gains tax make it a good time to sell -- but the value of catalogs also tells us something about the financial worth of music in the streaming era. </p><p>   First, there are annual payouts from songs. If you look at streaming numbers on Spotify -- Apple Music and other major players in the space don't have public-facing play counts -- Mr. Young and Mr. Springsteen have few songs that can match the numbers of a recent hit by Olivia Rodrigo or Doja Cat. But their total catalogs include hundreds of tracks, and the aggregate streaming numbers for the whole are sizable. Research has shown that 66% of streaming on Spotify is of catalog songs, rather than new hits. Those who own the rights to this music have a significant passive income stream. </p><p>   And that doesn't consider how old songs can come back into the conversation through social media. Fleetwood Mac's 1977 song \"Dreams\" hit No. 21 on Billboard's Hot 100 in October 2020 after its use in a popular TikTok meme, which for rights holders is essentially found money for doing nothing. Old songs have re-entered the charts for years -- think of soundtrack tie-ins -- but that usually required label investment and marketing muscle. In the era of physical media, capitalizing on an unexpected trend involved pressing and distributing records, which was a slow process. Even popular albums fell out of print when demand waned and they could no longer justify record-store shelf space. Streaming services are always on and instantly available, able to absorb lightning-fast changes in consumer culture. </p><p>   But the most salient long-term value proposition for catalog music might be traceable to a court case from the past decade. In 2015, a jury found the songwriters behind Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" liable for copyright infringement because of the song's uncredited similarity to Marvin Gaye's 1977 song \"Got to Give It Up,\" and awarded a multimillion-dollar verdict. The case accelerated the use of credited interpolations in songwriting: If a new track has a musical element that could conceivably be traced to an existing work, regardless of whether it was consciously borrowed, rights-holders cut a deal ahead of time, playing it safe by giving credit and a portion of the earnings. When such claims were rarer, minor unintended similarities were often overlooked. </p><p>   We find a prominent example from 2021 on several tracks from Ms. Rodrigo's hit album, \"Sour.\" Two of the record's songs were similar in some ways to songs by Taylor Swift, while another bore a resemblance to a song by pop-punk band Paramore. Songwriting credits were amended to reflect this -- in one case before the album's release; in the other two, after -- and the owners of the original copyrights now profit from Ms. Rodrigo's streaming royalties and radio airplay. Over the long term, three such credits on an LP as massive as Ms. Rodrigo's -- two of the album's tracks already have more than a billion streams -- will add up to a lot of money. </p><p>   In September, Rolling Stone reported on a \"songwriting camp\" sponsored by music publisher Primary Wave, in which the company encouraged professional tunesmiths to write new songs built from elements of the songs whose copyrights were held by the publisher. The idea was to assemble future hits using the DNA of old works that have already been bought and paid for, expanding the reach of Primary Wave's intellectual property and creating additional revenue streams. </p><p>   We hear a great deal about how much new music is uploaded to streaming services -- 60,000 tracks per day is one estimate -- so it's easy to forget that familiar songs from the past embedded in listeners' memories are actually a scarce resource. When you buy a song catalog, you're getting not just rights to the songs as written, but a piece of musical real estate that can be divided into parcels and leased to an infinite number of future renters. Those buying song catalogs are acquiring fragments of proprietary content that are standing by and ready to be repurposed. Whether that's through television commercials, Broadway musicals, or in a chorus hook from a teenage pop singer who may not even have been born yet remains to be seen. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Richardson is the Journal's rock and pop music critic.
