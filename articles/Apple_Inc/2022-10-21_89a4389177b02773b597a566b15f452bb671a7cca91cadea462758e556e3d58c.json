  "title": "Snap Digital Ads Slow  And May Stay Weak  ----  By Meghan Bobrowsky",
  "text": "<p>   Snap Inc. posted a further slowdown in sales growth and signaled the digital-ad market could remain lackluster for some time, sending its shares sharply lower in late trading. </p><p>   Snap, in an investor letter Thursday, said it is operating on an assumption of no revenue growth this quarter from the year-ago period,even though it has seen growth of about 9% so far for the period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet have been expecting almost 7% growth for the fourth quarter. </p><p>   The parent of the Snapchat app is among several social-media companies that have been struggling to respond to the sagging ad market and privacy policy changes Apple Inc. introduced last year that make it more difficult to target ads and track their performance. </p><p>   \"We expect that the operating environment will continue to be challenging in the months ahead,\" Snap said in its third-quarter results Thursday. </p><p>   Snap said it generated $1.13 billion in sales in the most recent quarter, 6% above the year-earlier figure. That was the slowest rate of growth since the company went public and below the 8% figure Snap said in August it was seeing. The sales figure narrowly missed Wall Street expectations, though its $360 million loss for the period was narrower than analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected. </p><p>   Snap shares fell more than 27% in after-hours trading on the results. The company, which has lost more than 85% of its value over the past year, didn't issue detailed financial forecasts for the current quarter, citing market uncertainty. </p><p>    Snap kicks off the quarterly results season for digital-ad-dependent companies, which have been grappling with market disruptions for more than a year. Soaring inflation, recession fears and the war in Ukraine have weighed on digital-ad spending this year, as have Apple's privacy changes. </p><p>   The industry's biggest actors, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., report results next week. Meta is expected to post another revenue decline, after its first-ever such retreat in the prior quarter. </p><p>   Concerns about a weakening economy have intensified in recent weeks. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos said in a tweet Tuesday that \"the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.\" A recent survey of economists by The Wall Street Journal also found that they expect the U.S. to enter a recession in the coming 12 months. </p><p>   \"Our advertising partners across many industries are decreasing their marketing budgets,\" Snap said Thursday. </p><p>   The ad downturn drove Snap in August to announce belt tightening. The company said it would lay off 20% of staff and cut several projects not core to its business. The measures are aimed at saving $500 million in annual costs, Snap said at the time. It also said its chief business officer and another ad executive were leaving. </p><p></p>",
