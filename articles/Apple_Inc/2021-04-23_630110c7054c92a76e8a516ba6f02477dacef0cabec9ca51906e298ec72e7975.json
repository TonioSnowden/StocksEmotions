  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>One of the shortest tournament competitions on record took place this week. The scrap between 12 top European football clubs and just about every other stakeholder in the game played out over the space of a few days following the attempted creation of a breakaway European Super League. Men (and women) of the match? The fans.</p> <p>Moneyed interests and sports fans have always eyed each other warily across the pitch. Even so, the latter have always understood that without capital and cash flow, teams cannot compete. What the broad protests in the UK and elsewhere proved is that, in football at least, club owners fear upsetting the local fan base.</p> <p>In this respect, the reach of social media matters. ESL ringleaders Real Madrid (36m Twitter followers) and Manchester United (25m) have broad followings. When popular players such as Marcus Rashford and coaches such as Pep Guardiola voiced their disagreement, the game was up. </p> <p>Lex first pointed to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73d3c73f-4687-4dcb-8679-8f1178600d9c\">anti-competitive aspects</a> of this new league. That included any retribution threatened upon players. But we also argued, once the ESL had collapsed, that when economic arguments take on political forces <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8199dc2d-9b20-440e-8b1b-861dfc9f1cd4\">the former is often left smarting</a> on the ground. </p> <p>Perhaps the participant in the ESL squad that was most disappointed was financial backer JPMorgan Chase. It had no game time whatsoever, though probably received some appearance fees. </p> <p>For different reasons, another bruised set of bankers sit over at Credit Suisse. Its team has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory over the past year. Most investment banks and fund management groups have had a banner year as markets surged. Not so much this Swiss lender.</p> <p>Since November, the bank has had to take a $450m writedown on its equity investment in hedge fund York Capital, promised to recoup billions to its private clients in funds tied to Greensill Capital and had another $4.7bn write-off on trading losses related to the unwinding of family office Archegos. The last meant that despite strong revenue growth in its first-quarter results, Credit Suisse still reported a hefty after-tax loss.</p> <p>A long list of executives have resigned, including the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fb7605e-f41c-4186-bc9c-07b9c61a7099\">heads of its prime brokerage business</a>, which provided part of the leverage for Archegos. This debt paid for the securities which the family office had to sell off so quickly. </p> <p>Lex wondered about the outlook for prime brokerage. The coaching team looks suspect, we reckoned, as risk assessments taken by senior executives and the board clearly were inadequate. Chief executive Thomas Gottstein decided to raise nearly $2bn in capital with mandatory convertible bonds to remove any doubts about the state of its otherwise decent balance sheet. The nominated new chair, António Horta-Osório, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f3bba0d-ac4b-4f84-819f-b1e75558d964\">plenty of work to do</a>. </p> <p>Volatility in the prices of publicly listed equities, and margin calls on these, provided the red flags on the Archegos debacle last month. Managers of private assets, such as alternative asset specialist Blackstone, had less concern. While last year's short but worrisome collapse in markets did affect the valuations of many of their private equity funds, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5030c7fd-80b1-48a3-b99a-0dc675414491\">Blackstone has bounced back</a>. Its clients continue to be happy to let the firm use their money to earn big fees. </p> <p>Roughly a decade ago, post the global financial crisis, Blackstone took a big bet on the depressed US housing market. It made a fortune, particularly buying up units outside city centres. Today those dwellings are in demand, offering space for those who wish to work from home. In the UK, out-of-town sales are also brisk. How long the allure of city life fades is a moot question, said Lex, but for now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9846b1a3-4c14-4301-a6e2-0a238fbbd43b\">suburbs rule</a>. </p> <p>Work from home-related virtual meeting software, such as Zoom, has, in turn, done very well. And a new social media company, Clubhouse, has an almost retro twist of being audio-only. Yet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f4086ca-43f1-4e3d-aa46-838b52485e4b\">the fad for its app seems to have faded </a>quickly this year. Since late January, the app has gone from 28th most popular among US iPhone users to 410th. Lex thought that the app's real enemy was boredom because it lacked sufficiently interesting chatroom topics. </p> <p>Speaking of fading popularity, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, founder of ecommerce site Alibaba, has fallen afoul with his own government. </p> <p>Government watchdogs worry about his influence and control over commercial lending data of Chinese customers via personal finance company Ant Group. Beijing has clamped down, and delayed his public listing of Ant. That has slashed its potential valuation by half, believed Lex. “Disruption” has long had positive connotations in Silicon Valley but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cbd2bd3-4856-490b-bcc2-d12f166014cf\">Beijing clearly thinks otherwise</a>.</p> <p>Here's hoping that readers find a grassy pitch to frolic upon this weekend,</p> <p><strong>Alan Livsey<br></strong><em>Lex Research Editor</em></p> <h2>Best of Lex articles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73d3c73f-4687-4dcb-8679-8f1178600d9c\">European Super League: breakaway should ring antitrust alarm bells</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8199dc2d-9b20-440e-8b1b-861dfc9f1cd4\">Super League: European politicians give US sports model a good kicking</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fb7605e-f41c-4186-bc9c-07b9c61a7099\">Prime brokers/Credit Suisse: tears before bedtime for the second tier</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f3bba0d-ac4b-4f84-819f-b1e75558d964\">Credit Suisse: a crisis Horta-Osório must not waste</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5030c7fd-80b1-48a3-b99a-0dc675414491\">Blackstone: private equity's third wheel follows own course</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9846b1a3-4c14-4301-a6e2-0a238fbbd43b\">House prices: urban exodus of upsizers shifts property demand</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f4086ca-43f1-4e3d-aa46-838b52485e4b\">Clubhouse: $4bn valuation ignores downloads in freefall</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cbd2bd3-4856-490b-bcc2-d12f166014cf\">Jack Ma/Ant Group: a disrupter who is no longer good for business</a></p><p>Source: Alan Livsey 2021 'Best of Lex: the game's up' FT.com 23 April.
