  "text": "<p>There are few better introductions to Jacob Collier than the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JCollierMusic/videos/happy-2021/141886031070678/\">18-second clip</a> posted on social media by the musician on New Year's Day. In tie-dye tracksuit and headband, he beckons the camera to his computer and starts hammering on a synthesiser: a flurry of lightning-fast chords and scales renders in the software on screen, triumphantly spelling out “Happy 2021”.</p> <p>It is at this intersection of infectious enthusiasm, technical virtuosity and digital wizardry that the 26-year-old has created his own musical universe — one that is playful, unique and wholly in tune with his generation.</p> <p>“I could try as hard as I could not to be 21st century, but at the end of the day I probably would be,” he admits over Zoom. “So I think it's nice to embrace that.”</p> <p>In a year that has forced artists offstage and online, there are far worse things to be than 21st century. It has enabled Collier to keep working remotely, with the latest volume of his quadruple album <em>Djesse,</em> recorded during the pandemic and nominated for Album of the Year at next month's Grammy Awards. All the while his social media and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmY49Zn4l0RMJnTWfV7Wsg\">YouTube</a> channel have been a jamboree of interviews, live performances and musical memes.</p> <p>Online engagement signalled the start of Collier's career as a 17-year-old — his videos were spotted by producer Quincy Jones, who soon signed him to his management — and it has enabled him to thrive in lockdown, too, posting what he wants, when he wants.</p> <p>“I think I was able to fall in love with what it meant to create music just for the sake of creating it again,” he says. He is sitting in the family music room in north London where he recorded his debut album, <em>In My Room</em>, and where four versions of himself played one of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJR6XSSKi-g&amp;feature=share&amp;fbclid=IwAR2b3dNN_dTlGkkJaLE5ec9OFLtDdwX6x6AmXj1XtfXjlukDOIg8S6lrh4c\">NPR's Tiny Desk concerts</a> last summer, each track layered to create a flawless ensemble, the perfect response to the present challenges of musical collaboration.</p> <p>It is also the room where he taught himself the many tools of his trade, growing up. Multi-instrumentalism is one of the striking things about Collier: his proficiency in keyboards, guitars, percussion and vocals (as well as more esoteric acquisitions such as bouzouki or harpejji) seems effortless, but is also a means to an end.</p> <p>“I get a real kick out of chasing something that I want to hear, that I've never heard before, that I know is possible,” he says. It is perhaps also a symptom of a musical family, since his mother, Susie, is a violinist and a professor at the Royal Academy's Junior Academy. But for Jacob, rare lessons took a back seat to self-discovery and learning by listening: Stevie Wonder, Sting, Bobby McFerrin, Björk, Beck and Bartók were just a few of his inspirations.</p> <p>It is an approach that has left surprisingly few gaps in his musical knowledge, and Collier has developed a reputation for compositions that effortlessly weave difficult musical concepts such as polyrhythms and microtonal scales into more familiar sounds and structures.</p> <p>“The most important thing is to be aware of as much as you can and then to do what feels right,” he says. “That might be ‘practise how to play counterpoint fugues' one day, and then the next day it might be ‘listen to Skrillex and have a cup of tea'.”</p> <p>This philosophy is clear throughout his work: an <em>a cappella</em> cover of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPLCk-FTVvw\">Moon River</a>”, for example, viewed more than 2.7m times on YouTube, features over 130 different voices (including those of Herbie Hancock, Chris Martin and Laura Mvula) while somehow retaining the intimacy of the original. <em>Djesse</em>, meanwhile, gleefully reconciles the familiar and the unfamiliar, delighting in a multiplicity of sounds and influences without losing its own identity.</p> <p>All the elements of the album's release — recording, production, live performance, social media — involve and fascinate Collier, and this has allowed him to create not just an album of songs, but an entire experience authentic to him. If <em>In My Room</em> was a solitary voyage of discovery, <em>Djesse</em> is a spiralling universe of connections and collaborations: formed of four volumes, with the third released in August, each is designed to reflect different, though similarly elusive, sides to the artist. The title is a phonetic nod to his initials, JC.</p> <p>“If I had to describe <em>Djesse</em> . . . ” Collier begins, pausing for perhaps the first time in our conversation to find the right words. “I guess it's like multidimensional joy.”</p> <p>His songs do not fit neatly into genres (Collier dismisses the concept as “so 20th century”), but joy might be the closest thing to a catch-all description. Despite jazz, classical, electronic and hip-hop influences, the albums are ultimately a celebration of music-making in all forms.&#xa0;It is a shared joy, too: the project has also involved more than 30 collaborators so far, including T-Pain, Kimbra and Oumou Sangaré. For the self-taught, self-sufficient artist, this has been a learning process in itself.&#xa0;</p> <p>Travelling to the Netherlands in 2018 to record the first volume with Jules Buckley and the Metropole Orkest, he quickly found that his arrangements needed adjusting to suit the range of the instruments or the dynamics of the ensemble. Working with British singer Lianne La Havas introduced him to a collaborative writing style that was then unknown territory to him.</p> <p>“Watching her intuit on the spot about something that I've been making, and watching it become something that we're making together, is a really amazing learning process,” he says. “With collaboration across the <em>Djesse</em> project, the thing that's been so inspiring for me has just been getting out of my own way.”</p> <p>It's a big departure for a musician who started as his own backing band and who continues to experiment with every aspect of performance. Collier and his clones didn't just devise and play the Tiny Desk concert, they edited the video too. Ditto for a “live” performance on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRnNuJaakss\">Tonight Show</a> with Jimmy Fallon last month, where four versions of himself appear on stage alongside the singer Mahalia. Or, in a baffling display of musicianship, adding delay to his playing on an Instagram <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacobcollier/status/1258905373924352002?lang=en\">livestream</a> with Coldplay's Chris Martin in order to compensate for the latency on the platform.</p> <p>This is all part of a self-sufficiency that has guided Collier's musical journey so far and allowed him to keep exploring at a time when the world feels smaller than ever. He hopes to release <em>Djesse Vol. 4</em>, complete with “Bulgarian folk and death metal” influences, at the end of this year or the beginning of the next — whenever touring becomes possible again. Until then, he can always count on his clones.</p> <p><em>The Grammy Awards are on March 15<br></em><a href=\"http://www.jacobcollier.com\"><em>jacobcollier.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
