  "text": "<p>See also: Want a PS5? Walmart, Amazon and Best Buy want you to subscribe first</p><p>The PS5 restock will be in \"limited quantities,\" according to the retailer's listing, and this particular drop is online-only.</p><p>The move from Best Buy continues a trend of major retailers putting some of its most popular products behind a paywall. Other retailers including Walmart WMT and Amazon AMZN have similarly put PS5s and other electronic consoles behind paywalls in the past year. Walmart made these items only available to Walmart+ members ($98 per year) and Amazon put these items behind its signature service Amazon Prime.</p><p>In addition to the possibility of growing its paid subscriber base, this method of product release will help eliminate \"bots\" attempting to buy consoles, since only subscriber accounts can make purchases. Bots are software used to create multiple entries for contests and faster checkout times for exclusive products. Bots are commonly used in limited online releases with products like shoes, concert tickets and other collectibles â€” bot software is typically faster than people at making online purchases.</p><p>Best Buy did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment on this story.</p><p>See also: Apple stock target cut on downbeat hardware revenue outlook</p><p>Sony initially released the PS5 in November 2020, but the product is still not widely available due to supply chain issues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the global chip shortage.</p><p>\"The level of demand by customers is so high for PS5,\" Sony's Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said in 2021. \"We have to look at the global shortage of semiconductors, or we try to increase our capacity. We face difficulties because of this global situation.\"</p><p>When will PS5s become widely available? Sony says the shortage will continue through 2022.</p><p>PS5 restock: Best Buy to have PlayStation 5s in stock this week, but there's a catch</p>",
