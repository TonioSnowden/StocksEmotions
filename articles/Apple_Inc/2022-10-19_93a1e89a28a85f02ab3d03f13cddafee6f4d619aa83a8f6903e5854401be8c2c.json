  "title": "Technology:  First-Edition iPhone Is Auctioned for $39,000  ----  By Alyssa Lukpat",
  "text": "<p>   For the price of dozens of brand new iPhones, a buyer purchased a first edition of Apple Inc.'s game-changing device for more than $39,000. </p><p>   LCG Auctions sold an unopened 2007 iPhone on Sunday, according to the Louisiana-based auction house. LCG didn't name the buyer, but said he lived in Australia. </p><p>   The nearly half-inch-thick iPhone, which was still in the original factory-sealed box, was virtually flawless, according to the auction house. </p><p>   \"Collectors and investors would be hard pressed to find a superior example,\" LCG said. </p><p>    Mark Montero, the founder of LCG Auctions, said Tuesday that he believed $39,339.60 was a record price for a first-edition iPhone. He said the seller, an American man, decided to put the iPhone on the market after seeing that another first-edition iPhone sold for $35,000 at an auction in August. </p><p>   \"An item like this is something everyone can relate to,\" Mr. Montero said, adding, \"It has a lot going for it as a collectible investment.\" </p><p>   The original iPhone was sold in a black box with a picture of the phone on the front. Early iPhone adopters would recognize the old app widgets, including an iPod app and an SMS text button. </p><p>   Apple's first iPhone was a brick by today's standards but a revolution in the aughts. The phone came tricked out with a 3.5-inch display, a sleek interface and as much as 16 gigabytes of storage. It changed the cellphone game at a time when many devices still flipped open. </p><p>   When Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, the company described it in part as a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The company sold its one millionth iPhone in 74 days. </p><p>   Potential buyers bid 28 times online for the iPhone sold on Sunday, according to LCG. The starting price was $2,500. </p><p>   The market for vintage memorabilia has surged during the pandemic. Investors have purchased these items at record prices in recent years as a way to diversify their financial holdings or to own something that can withstand inflation. Other investors bought the items because they had more time to spend by an auction block. </p><p></p>",
