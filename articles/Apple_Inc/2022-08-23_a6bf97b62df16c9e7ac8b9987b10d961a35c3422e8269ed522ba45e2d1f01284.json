  "title": "KPMG to Cut Manhattan Office Space in Move to New U.S. Headquarters at Hudson Yards; Firm shrinking its New York office space by over 40% as it pursues hybrid-work strategy",
  "text": "<p>The firm plans to vacate the roughly 800,000 square feet it currently occupies at three Midtown Manhattan office buildings that were built between the 1960s and '80s. It expects to move in 2025 to Two Manhattan West, an under-construction skyscraper developed by Brookfield Properties. It will serve as KPMG's new U.S. headquarters.</p><p>KPMG's move is the latest sign that even as more workers gradually return to the office, hybrid and remote work appear here to stay. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google also said in recent months they were calling employees back to the workplace but would continue to allow some form of hybrid work.</p><p>The KPMG deal also highlights the harsh new reality for the office sector. Companies are still willing to spend big on modern office space with more amenities, outdoor space and energy efficiency. But they often want far less of it. That leaves landlords with increasingly large holes to fill, especially in older buildings.</p><p>KPMG wasn't planning to significantly reduce its space when it began looking for a new Manhattan office in 2018, said U.S. chief executive Paul Knopp. The pandemic changed that.</p><p>After allowing employees to work remotely for the better part of two years, the company is now pursuing a hybrid-work strategy. Employees are expected to gather at company or client offices on some days, but are otherwise free to work from home, Mr. Knopp said. That means KPMG needs far less office space in New York even as it plans to increase its head count while saving money on its New York City real estate costs.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Has your company made changes to its office footprint recently? If so, what were they? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The spread of hybrid work has helped push up U.S. office vacancy rates to the highest level in decades. Around 19% of U.S. office space was vacant in the second quarter, according to brokerage JLL.</p><p>In Manhattan, new leases haven't kept up with the amount of space being vacated. Since the first quarter of 2020, companies in New York have reduced their office space by a net 30 million square feet, according to data from CoStar Group. That is roughly equivalent to 11 Empire State Buildings.</p><p>Brokers say many new, modern skyscrapers have fared better than older buildings because companies are still willing to pay high rents for high-end space near transportation hubs and other desirable locations. In June, Brookfield said law firm Clifford Chance LLP signed a 144,000-square-foot lease at Two Manhattan West. The 58-story tower, part of Brookfield and the Qatar Investment Authority's Manhattan West megadevelopment near Pennsylvania Station, is scheduled for completion next year.</p><p>Mr. Knopp said KPMG's new office will feature more collaborative space and rooms equipped with technology that will make it easier for people to call into meetings. There will be fewer assigned desks and private offices.</p><p>Before committing to Two Manhattan West, KPMG surveyed its employees' commuting patterns and decided to stay in Midtown Manhattan close to transportation hubs to keep commutes short, said New York office managing partner Yesenia Scheker Izquierdo. The company never seriously considered leaving the New York area, where it employs almost 9,000 people.</p><p>\"It's our largest market, to say the least,\" she said. \"We have extremely important clients here, terrific talent here, and it's just really a great city to work and to live.\"</p><p>Write to Konrad Putzier at konrad.putzier@wsj.com</p><p>KPMG to Cut Manhattan Office Space in Move to New U.S. Headquarters at Hudson Yards</p>",
