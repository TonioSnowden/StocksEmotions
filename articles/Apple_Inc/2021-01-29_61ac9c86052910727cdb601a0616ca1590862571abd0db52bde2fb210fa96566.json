  "title": "The poem: ‘Villette' by Holly Pester",
  "text": "<p>In the novel <em>Villette</em>, either I or Lucy Snowe live and work in a girls'<br>school that either she or I found in a small French town. She has<br>nowhere / I have nowhere and no thing in which to hide any of her few<br>/ my few possessions. Her mattresses / my mattresses and bedding in<br>the dormitory where she sleeps / I sleep are checked over daily, and she<br>suspects / I suspect that her / my desk in the classroom is also looked<br>through.</p> <p>She has nowhere / I have nowhere to hide a letter that was sent to her<br>/ to me by Dr Graham, who she has a heavy and imaginative crush on<br>/ who I have a heavy and imaginative crush on.</p> <p>She invests / I invest in the letter a devotional adoration that<br>mismatches the friendly goodwill it was written with.</p> <p>I / Lucy guess that the schoolmistress has snatched, read and then<br>returned the letter to under her / my bed. Lucy panics over her / my<br>lack of private space and makes the eccentric decision to bury the<br>letter in the garden grounds of the school.</p> <p>She folds the pages tightly / I fold the pages tightly, wrap them in<br>a silk handkerchief dipped in oil, curl them into a glass bottle and<br>hermetically seal the bottle with wax.</p> <p>She buries the bottle / I bury the bottle under the roots of an ivy bush<br>in an area of the garden that is haunted by either me or the ghost of<br>a nun who was buried alive.</p> <p>In this gesture / in my gesture, Lucy Snowe rejects the possibility of<br>possessing the letter. She applies / I apply a fantastical value to the<br>letter. The letter passes into an earthed state of absence. I use / Lucy<br>uses burial as a way to disown the letter and to refuse being privately<br>subjected by the letter. She instead / I instead ecstatically ritualise her<br>poverty / my poverty, and her otherness / my otherness to ownership<br>of objects, and evacuate the self into love.</p> <p><em>From ‘Comic Timing' (Granta Poetry, £10.99)</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
