  "title": "U.S. News:  Bill Would Set Rules for App Stores  ----  By John D. McKinnon",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Senators introduced legislation that would impose new rules for app stores, amid debate over the dominant roles Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google play in the mobile ecosystem. </p><p>   The bipartisan bill by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) and Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) aims to boost competition and consumer protections by placing new restrictions on how the stores operate and what rules they can impose on app developers. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), chair of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, co-sponsored the bill. </p><p>   Apple said in a statement that its app store \"is the cornerstone of our work to connect developers and customers in a way that is safe and trustworthy. The result has been an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation.\" </p><p>   Google declined to comment on the legislation. Google says its Android system provides choice that others don't. Device makers and carriers can preload competing app stores alongside Google Play, for example. </p><p>   Called the Open App Markets Act, the measure is the latest reflection of lawmakers' concerns about the power of major technology companies across a range of markets including search, advertising and social media. It aims to address longstanding concerns among developers such as Epic Games Inc. about in-app payments and other matters. </p><p>   The current Congress already has taken steps on antitrust policy, with a House committee passing a package of changes in June targeting Apple, Google and others. The full House hasn't voted on the bills. </p><p>   The new measure's introduction in the Senate is another warning shot for the tech companies, several of which have faced antitrust litigation. Many of the ideas in the House antitrust bills haven't gained traction in the Senate, but Wednesday's proposal targets some of the same app-store practices that inspired parts of the House legislation. </p><p>   At a Senate hearing focused on app stores in April, familiar critics of Apple and Google -- including music streaming service Spotify Technology SA and online dating service Match Group Inc. -- accused the companies of profiting unfairly, for example from commissions they charge for payment processing. </p><p>   In response, Apple and Google executives said it was critical that they maintain high standards for their app stores, including on security. They have said app stores benefit consumers and create a profitable platform for other businesses, portraying their critics as concerned about profits, not fair competition. </p><p>   The new bill's sponsors said the April hearing showed that Apple and Google act as gatekeepers to the mobile ecosystem and stifle competition in the app store market. </p><p>   \"For years, Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark -- pocketing hefty windfalls while acting as supposedly benevolent gatekeepers of this multibillion-dollar market,\" Mr. Blumenthal said. </p><p>   Ms. Blackburn said that tech giants \"are forcing their own app stores on users at the expense of innovative startups,\" adding that \"their anticompetitive conduct is a direct affront to a free and fair marketplace.\" </p><p>   For example, the lawmakers said, Apple has prevented the creation of third-party app stores on iPhones, required app developers to use Apple's payment system exclusively and penalized developers for telling users about discounted offers. Such moves have reduced competition and increased prices for consumers, the senators said. </p><p>   Their legislation would bar the companies from certain conduct that would tend to force developers to use their app stores or payment systems. It also would obligate the companies to protect app developers' rights to tell consumers about lower prices and offer competitive pricing. It would effectively allow apps to be loaded onto Apple users' devices outside of the company's official app store. </p><p></p>",
