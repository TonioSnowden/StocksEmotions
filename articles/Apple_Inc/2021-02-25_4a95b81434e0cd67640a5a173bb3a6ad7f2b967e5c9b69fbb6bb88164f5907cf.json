  "text": "<p>Amazon's&#xa0;first foray into producing devices&#xa0;in India begins&#xa0;later this year, the US&#xa0;ecommerce company announced this month, saying the move reflects its “commitment” to New Delhi's efforts to build a more independent supply chain.</p> <p>Amazon will produce Fire TV Stick devices in the country. Manufacturing will be handled by a subsidiary of Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry — the iPhone assembler better known as Foxconn — at a plant in Chennai. </p> <p>The facility&#xa0;“will be able to produce hundreds of thousands” of devices a year, according to an Amazon statement.</p> <p>The decision was announced by Ravi Shankar Prasad, India's minister for electronics and information technology, and Amit Agarwal, head of Amazon's India operations, in an online meeting.</p> <p>“We welcome Amazon's decision to set up a manufacturing line in Chennai, as it will enhance domestic production capacities, and create jobs as well,” Prasad said.</p> <p>The move fits India's campaign for greater “self-reliance”&#xa0;following the disruption caused by coronavirus and New Delhi's freezing out of Chinese companies in response to a border clash. </p> <p>The government formed&#xa0;a new subsidy programme, among other measures, to promote local manufacturing and new investment.</p> <p>In Amazon's statement, Agarwal noted the company's pledge to invest $1bn in India to digitise small businesses and help them sell worldwide, enable $10bn in exports and create 1m jobs by 2025.</p> <p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Amazon-partners-with-Foxconn-to-make-Fire-TV-Sticks-in-India\"><em>A version of this article</em></a><em> was first published by Nikkei Asia on February 17 2021. ©2021 Nikkei Inc.
