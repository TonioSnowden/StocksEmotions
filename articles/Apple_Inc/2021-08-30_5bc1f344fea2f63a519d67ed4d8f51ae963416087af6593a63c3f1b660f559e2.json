  "text": "<p>Hurricane Ida wiped out power in New Orleans&#xa0;as winds of up to 150mph and a storm surge battered the US Gulf Coast, leaving more than 1m households in Louisiana without electricity.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center said the Category 4 storm made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, about 60 miles south of New Orleans, yesterday afternoon causing “catastrophic damage”.</p> <p>“This is one of the strongest storms to make landfall here in modern times,” said John Bel Edwards, Louisiana governor. “We can expect devastating impacts to continue for the next 24 hours or so.”</p> <p>Figures from PowerOutage.US, which tracks disruptions to the country's electrical network, showed that <a href=\"https://poweroutage.us/\">50 per cent of Louisiana's 2.2m residents </a>were without power. </p> <p>The storm hit 16 years after Hurricane Katrina overwhelmed the low-lying region's flood defences and killed more than 1,800 people.</p> <p>Officials in the region said a $15bn system of pumps, levees and flood barriers built after Katrina had prepared them for storms such as Ida but warned they would be unable to assess the true extent of the damage until the severe weather cleared.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?start#contents\">downgraded the storm this morning</a>, saying wind speeds had dropped to 60mph. But it warned that as Ida moved inland there was considerable risk of flooding in portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Upper Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians “through Wednesday”.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.

But some partners have warned that the firms could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a47fb4a-4a10-4c05-8c5d-02d83052bee7\">face a backlash</a> if they fail to live up to the standards they promote.</p> <p><strong>How US community banks became ‘irreplaceable' </strong>Local lenders played an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4face0c6-c1fb-47af-972b-8749e92b4baf\">outsized role</a> in dispensing loans to small businesses and the self-employed during the pandemic.
