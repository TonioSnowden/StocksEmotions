(A beta version will be coming sooner for test users.)</p><p>The software update to its mobile operating system would make it so that Facebook or other companies would no longer be able to collect a person's advertising identifier without permission.</p><p>Chief Executive Tim Cook is slated to speak Thursday on the topic of data privacy at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, whose company has been sued by the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states over anticompetitive claims, sought to cast Apple's privacy moves as a means to use its platform to put Facebook at a disadvantage. Apple, too, has faced claims from tech rivals that its practices are anticompetitive. Both tech giants have denied wrongdoing.</p>",
