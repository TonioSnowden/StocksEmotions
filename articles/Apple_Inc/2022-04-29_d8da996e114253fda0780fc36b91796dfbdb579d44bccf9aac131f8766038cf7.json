  "text": "<p>As the health crisis has reshaped the way people think about work and travel, companies are feeling their way to new, postpandemic norms. Some are deciding that having teams working together again in offices is the best way forward. Airbnb is backing a more open view of where people can work, adding fuel to a trend that could benefit its business if it leads to more people working from its rental properties.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. are urging workers to return to the office a few days a week. Twitter Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. are offering greater flexibility. But myriad tax and other rules have generally meant that employees have had to stick to working in countries where they have legal residency. Airbnb is trying to go further than most to help its employees choose their own new normal.</p><p>Under Airbnb's new policy, pay scales for all U.S. and Canadian employees will be standardized at the top-paying tier instead of using location-based tiers. The home-rental company also said that its more than 6,000 employees can work for as long as three months in a year from 170 of the countries and regions in which the company operates.</p><p>Airbnb is creating a 20-person team that works with employees to navigate the payroll and tax complications. \"It's basically a giant paperwork nuisance and no one likes to put up with it,\" Mr. Chesky said. The company is separately lobbying governments around the world to try to make it easier for travelers to work remotely for extended periods.</p><p>How companies compensate relocating workers can be tricky. Tech companies including Facebook said early on in the pandemic that they would adjust pay for people moving to less expensive cities. Others like Reddit Inc. and Zillow Group decided to do away with location-based pay. Cloud-software company Okta Inc. initially cut pay for relocating workers but later reversed its decision.</p><p>The ability to work remotely and travel to places beyond crowded city centers made Airbnb a pandemic winner while hotel chains in big cities suffered. Airbnb's 2021 revenue topped 2019. Chains like Marriott International Inc. and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. haven't bounced back to prepandemic revenue.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
