  "title": "Apple Sues Israeli Firm NSO Over Spyware, Claiming iPhone Hacks; Lawsuit seeks to bar surveillance-software company from using iPhone maker's products",
  "text": "<p>The Israeli company has developed hacking techniques to install its surveillance software, called Pegasus, on Apple's mobile phones without a user's knowledge or consent, according to security researchers. Pegasus, they say, turns the iPhone into a silent spying device by gaining access to the device's files, messages, microphone and camera.</p><p>Apple's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, is another salvo in an emerging strategy against the surveillance techniques. In the past, Apple and other companies would use bug fixes and security enhancements to patch vulnerabilities and render such software unusable. Now, litigation and government pressure is increasingly becoming another tool to curtail its use.</p><p>NSO \"did not breach data contained on Apple's servers, but did abuse Apple's services and servers to perpetrate attacks,\" Apple's complaint states.</p><p>An NSO representative didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In 2019, the WhatsApp messaging service sued NSO, alleging that the company sent malware to 1,400 of its users. WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc.</p><p>NSO has disputed these allegations, saying that its products are used by government-intelligence and law-enforcement agencies to fight terrorism and crime. The company has previously said that it has terminated contracts with governments that have abused its software and took steps to prevent abuse.</p><p>\"Very glad to see Apple join the effort to hold spyware companies accountable,\" Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, said Tuesday in a tweet. \"We've long called for industry action against NSO and today's lawsuit shows that technology providers are united in fighting spyware and ensuring more security for our users.\"</p><p>These two lawsuits show tech giants turning to new methods after years of trying to thwart commercial hacking tools with technical means, said John Scott-Railton, a researcher with Citizen Lab, an organization that has been tracking NSO Group's activities for years. \"Apple has been clearly quietly getting a much better understanding of what's going on with NSO,\" he said.</p><p>Apple employees have spent thousands of hours responding to the NSO Group's attacks, the tech company said in its filing. In 2016, researchers have said, the NSO Group discovered a way to install its spyware on victims' iPhones with just the click of a link. In September, researchers said the NSO Group developed an even more sophisticated \"zero click\" iPhone attack that installed Pegasus spyware on devices without any action by victims. Both incidents prompted Apple to push out security updates for its devices.</p><p>The NSO Group has faced increasing pressure to change its business practices as researchers have linked its products to cyberattacks on journalists, politicians and political dissidents.</p><p>On Monday, ratings firm Moody's Corp. downgraded NSO's debt, saying the company is at an increased risk of default due to trade restrictions and allegations that its surveillance software has been used inappropriately. NSO is \"highly dependent on new license sales which we believe can become increasingly difficult given the actions taken against NSO,\" Moody's said in the report.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Biden administration placed the NSO Group on an export prohibition list to sanction the company for this alleged behavior, restricting it from obtaining some U.S. technology. The move could also make it harder for the company to seek contracts with international customers.</p><p>The administration said the NSO Group \"developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used this tool to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers.\" The State Department said the designation, which was also applied to other technology vendors, reflects the administration's goal to halt \"the proliferation and misuse of digital tools used for repression.\"</p><p>Write to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com</p><p>Apple Sues Israeli Firm NSO Over Spyware, Claiming iPhone Hacks</p>",
