  "title": "Mariah Carey says 'it's time' to start celebrating Christmas — and the world seems to agree; The pop star is promoting her hit song 'All I Want for Christmas' nearly two months before the holiday",
  "text": "<p>The pop star tweeted out that very message early Tuesday morning with a video that showed her dressed in witchy garb before suddenly switching to a Christmas outfit. Naturally, her holiday hit, \"All I Want for Christmas,\" accompanied the conclusion of the video.</p><p>The tweet has already received close to a half-million \"likes.\" Fans are signaling they agree with Carey and can't wait for some holiday cheer, Mariah-style.</p><p>Sending out the tweet was a logical move for Carey, who has aimed to position herself as the \"Queen of Christmas\" (and has even tried to trademark that label). And it's all largely connected to \"All I Want for Christmas,\" a song that debuted in 1994 and appeared on a Carey holiday album, but that has become a bigger and bigger seasonal staple in recent years.</p><p>Consider that in the U.S., the song didn't even crack Billboard's Hot 100 chart until 2000. And it didn't become a No. 1 hit until 2019 — some 25 years after its initial release.</p><p>It has also surged on streaming media in recent years, with one report estimating it has earned Carey at least $60 million in streaming royalties.</p><p>Already, the song is finding its way on streaming charts this year, landing in the 34th spot on today's iTunes chart — almost two months before Christmas.</p><p>Carey is capitalizing on her Christmas fame with a live holiday show this season, with dates scheduled in New York and Toronto. Tickets go as high as $3,000 apiece.</p><p>The eventual success of the song has been a bit of a surprise —- or at least that's what Walter Afanasieff, who co-wrote \"All I Want\" with Carey, once told Billboard. \"To think of it as a single that's going to No. 1, that's going to drive an album…we didn't have an inkling of that,\" he said.</p><p>Carey has also seemingly been surprised by all the fuss. \"I'm just a person who likes Christmas, OK? Who happened to write some songs,\" she said in a 2017 interview with The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>Mariah Carey says 'it's time' to start celebrating Christmas — and the world seems to agree</p>",
