  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Eating & Drinking: No Gluten, All the Joy --- These recipes for thumbprint cookies, an apple-frangipane galette and two easy cakes are gluten-free and fully festive",
  "text": "<p>I called Katarina Cermelj, a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry and the author of \"Baked to Perfection: Delicious Gluten-Free Recipes With a Pinch of Science,\" for advice. The subject of our call quickly became xanthan gum, a binder that gives gluten-free recipes the elasticity and flexibility the gluten in wheat flour would otherwise provide. Dr. Cermelj suggested I add a pinch of the gum -- sold as a powder -- to water. A gel formed instantly, illustrating why it's called gum. This experiment was also her way of warning me that a little goes a long way. That night, xanthan gum saved my galette dough from being dry and crumbly. The flaky crust proved so good, in fact, that I used it the following day for a pissaladiere, the Provencal onion tart.</p><p>With a little further research, I came to understand that xanthan gum is a type of carbohydrate known as a polysaccharide, useful to cooks because it is a uniquely efficient stabilizer that, unlike other starches, requires no heat to hydrate. Browsing the gluten-free-flour selection at my local supermarket was, however, confusing enough to send me to back to Dr. Cermelj for another lesson.</p><p>She explained that no two blends are the same, and she recommended checking the ingredient list. Some gluten-free flours already contain a small amount of xanthan gum, and if that's the case, you should reduce the amount of xanthan you add, generally by half. If you can, buy a blend without any xanthan so you can better control the ratio.</p><p>Dr. Cermelj also urged that flour blends be weighed by scale, not measured by cup -- and there she was preaching to the converted. While it typically works fine to measure conventional flour by fluffing with a fork, spooning lightly into a measuring cup and running the flat-side of a knife across the top to remove excess, I had already found that measuring gluten-free blends this way produces results that vary in weight by as much as 40%. For accuracy, it's worth weighing your gluten-free flour on a scale. (The recipes accompanying this story give flour measurements in both grams and cups.)</p><p>No wonder chemists are drawn to baking. Making a cake rise and producing a tender crumb -- in other words, achieving the right structure -- demands precision when it comes to the flour, eggs, fat and leavener. Armed with my scale and my xanthan gum, I made easy work of Dr. Cermelj's recipe for chocolate marble Bundt cake with a sunny citrus edge. I've added it to my gluten-free holiday-baking repertoire along with that apple galette, plus a classic lemon drizzle cake and some delicious peanut butter and jam thumbprint cookies worth including in any Christmastime tin.</p><p>---</p><p>Gluten-Free Peanut Butter and Jam Thumbprint Cookies</p><p>Total Time: 1 hour</p><p>Makes: 30</p><p>1/2 cup natural, unsweetened, smooth peanut butter</p><p>7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</p><p>1/2 cup light brown soft sugar</p><p>2 eggs, separated into yolks and whites</p><p>2 tablespoons whole milk, at room temperature</p><p>1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste</p><p>200 grams (1 1/2 cups) gluten-free flour blend</p><p>1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum</p><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p><p>1 cup unsalted, raw peanuts, toasted and chopped</p><p>6 tablespoons raspberry or strawberry jam</p><p>1. Set an oven rack in the middle position, and preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</p><p>2. In a bowl, use a wooden spoon or spatula to mix peanut butter with butter and sugar until smooth. Add egg yolks, milk and vanilla paste, and mix until evenly incorporated. Sift in gluten-free flour, xanthan gum and salt. Mix with the spoon or spatula until you get a smooth, soft (but not sticky) dough that can be shaped into balls without cracking or crumbling.</p><p>3. Lightly whisk egg whites in a small bowl. Place chopped peanuts in another small bowl.</p><p>4. Roll 1 tablespoon cookie dough into a ball. Roll dough ball first in egg whites, then in chopped peanuts. Transfer peanut-covered dough ball to prepared baking sheet. Use your thumb or a 1/2-teaspoon measuring spoon to create a well in the center. Repeat with remaining dough to make 30 cookies, spacing them about 1 inch apart on baking sheets.</p><p>5. Bake 1 sheet at a time on center rack of oven until cookies are light golden brown, 16-18 minutes. Remove from oven, and immediately use 1/2-teaspoon measuring spoon to deepen the well at the center of each cookie, which might have closed up during baking.</p><p>6. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool, then fill each cookie with about 1/2 teaspoon raspberry or strawberry jam. These can be stored for 5 days in a closed container at room temperature.</p>",
