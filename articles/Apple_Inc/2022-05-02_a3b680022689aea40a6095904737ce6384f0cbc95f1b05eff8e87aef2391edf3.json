  "text": "<p>While Apple Pay makes use of NFC technology, the EC said Apple has limited the ability of independent mobile-wallet developers to use NFC functions on Apple devices. \"This has an exclusionary effect on competitors and leads to less innovation and less choice for consumers for mobile wallets on iPhones,\" the EC said in its release.</p><p>Apple has the option to provide written replies to the EC's preliminary concerns and ask for an oral hearing. \"Sending a Statement of Objections and opening of a formal antitrust investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigations,\" the commission said.</p><p>It further noted that there are \"no legal deadlines\" for the conclusion of an antitrust investigation. The timing is determined by the complexity of the situation and the extent of cooperation with the investigation, among other factors.</p><p>\"We designed Apple Pay to provide an easy and secure way for users to digitally present their existing payment cards and for banks and other financial institutions to offer contactless payments for their customers,\" an Apple spokesperson said. \"Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security.\"</p><p>The company added that it would \"continue to engage with the Commission to ensure European consumers have access to the payment option of their choice in a safe and secure environment.\"</p><p>See also: It wasn't hard for Apple to cut off Russia, but the precedent could be troublesome â€” 'China is the real test'</p><p>Apple has said that Apple Pay still only makes up a small portion of European transactions and that its rules on NFC technology promote security.</p><p>The EC flagged that Apple has in the past cited security concerns as rationale for limits on NFC access, but the commission did not find evidence indicating that broader NFC access would lead to heightened security risks.</p><p>\"On the contrary, evidence on our file indicates that Apple's conduct cannot be justified by security concerns,\" Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said in a separate release containing her remarks on the preliminary findings.</p><p>Shares of Apple were down 1.7% in Monday morning trading. They've lost about 12% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has slipped roughly 7%.</p><p>Apple hurt competition with its mobile-wallet practices, European regulators say</p>",
