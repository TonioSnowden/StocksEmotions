  "title": "Goldman Sachs plans major reorganisation",
  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs is planning to fold its crown jewel trading and investment banking business into one unit as it shrinks from four to three divisions. The move is part of a sweeping reorganisation by chief executive David Solomon in an attempt to buttress the bank's stock market valuation.</p> <p>Solomon has struggled to close a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30c61d67-8af9-474e-872a-b0c75258a781\">stock market valuation gap</a> with rival banks that has widened since he took over as chief executive in 2018.</p> <p>The Wall Street bank is now looking to merge its asset and wealth management divisions and shift part of its money-losing consumer business into a newly formed unit, said people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The combined asset and wealth division will include its online retail bank Marcus and be led by Marc Nachmann, at present the co-head of Goldman's trading division.</p> <p>Other parts of Goldman's retail banking business, such as its Apple credit card partnership and online loans provider GreenSky, which it acquired last year, will form a new division called Platform Solutions. This will also house Goldman's burgeoning transaction banking business, which helps companies move their money around and had previously been part of Goldman's investment bank.</p> <p>Goldman's push into retail banking started in 2016 and has come under scrutiny from investors and internally following years of losses and escalating costs.</p> <p>The new structure, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, could be announced as soon as Tuesday when <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/980562d6-2db0-4b25-a349-b83d4b86bea7\">Goldman</a> reports third-quarter earnings.</p> <p>The people familiar with the matter said the combined investment banking and trading division will have three co-heads: Dan Dees and Jim Esposito, who currently run the investment bank, and Ashok Varadhan, co-head of the trading division. </p> <p>The unified trading and banking division will bring Goldman in line with peers Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase which have a similar structure.</p> <p>The moves mark a major change for how one of Wall Street's biggest players will operate. They come after years of struggles to persuade investors to assign Goldman's stock a higher valuation. </p> <p>Goldman delivered record profits and its share price hit a record high last year, but its price to book ratio, a metric that compares a company's stock price against the value of its assets to give a sense of its true valuation, has lagged behind peers such as Morgan Stanley. </p> <p>The market has cheered Morgan Stanley's expansion into more stable fee-generating businesses such as wealth management, as opposed to volatile investment banking and trading activities. </p> <p>Solomon has tried to expand into more predictable businesses such as asset management and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01b65b53-f937-4816-9eee-ee4495e77df6\">transaction banking</a>, and offset the volatility of the trading business, but has struggled to change Goldman's revenue mix meaningfully away from investment banking and trading.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Goldman Sachs plans major reorganisation' FT.com 17 October.
