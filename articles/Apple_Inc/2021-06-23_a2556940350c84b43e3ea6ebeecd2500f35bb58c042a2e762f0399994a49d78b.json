  "text": "<p>When I was a child in Britain in the 1970s, I would sometimes creep into my beloved Great Aunt Ruth's kitchen and gawp at her cabinets. Ruth was born in 1905 and lived through two world wars. Her experience of privations and rationing made her into a recycling maestro. And her kitchen testified.</p> <p>Her drawers contained piles of old, brown paper bags, carefully folded, ready for reuse, along with jars, string, rubber bands, wrapping paper and tin foil. She reused tea bags and foraged in the woods, rivers and beaches of her native Devon for food.</p> <p>Some of my happiest memories with her involved scouring beach rocks for periwinkles, collecting blackberries from hedgerows and combing Dartmoor bushes for bilberries, which we stored in old plastic tubs and carried in khaki backpacks that Ruth made for the kids from waste fabric. After meals, uneaten food was carefully stored for later in reusable pots.</p> <p>At the time, this seemed normal. But as I grew up, it began to seem increasingly quaint. By the late 20th century, the consumer goods industry had become so powerful and plastic so cheap to produce that most westerners saw little need to reuse tea bags, tubs or glass jars, let alone string. </p> <p>Mass manufacturing and outsourcing brought costs down, so that the price of everyday products — from clothes to kitchen gadgets — plummeted. It felt normal to toss things away and assume that someone else would clean up the mess. Landfills were out of sight and mind.</p> <p>But now, I am starting to experience a tinge of déjà vu in my own kitchen. One of my teenage daughters has become a passionate eco-warrior, inspired by TikTok videos about <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/zero-waste-families-plastic-culture\">zero-waste lifestyles</a> and sustainability hacks. </p> <p>This has not yet prompted us to hoard string but my daughter is encouraging us to reuse almost everything else. And we have embarked on a war on food waste, scanning social media for ways to cook “discarded” beetroot stalks, apple cores and damaged cabbage leaves. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at a macro scale, the phrase “circular economy” is all the rage. An unexpected twist to 21st-century life, the idea aims to replace the “take, make, waste” model of the past. And as such, it reveals two important points.</p> <p>First, trends in history — including our definition of “progress” — rarely move in straight lines, but rather in loops. Some sustainability champions are aware of this. The British food writer Bee Wilson, for example, recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KitchenBee/status/1403067908113248265\">tweeted an excerpt</a> from a 1951 book <em>Cooking from Scratch</em> that urged readers to save and reuse “scallop shells, butter papers, oiled apple wrappers, liquid from pickled walnuts”. </p> <p>Such is the enthusiasm (or arrogance) of youth that I suspect most young environmentalists today are only vaguely aware of these parallels. Each generation thinks it has remade its world.</p> <p>The second point is that if we are going to combat climate change, we need to reflect not just on our habits, but also our <em>habitus</em>, to cite a concept coined by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69bbdb4e-f4be-11e2-a62e-00144feabdc0\">Pierre Bourdieu</a>, the French social scientist and one of the most brilliant intellectuals of the 20th century. </p> <p>He argued that how we arrange our physical space, goods, calendar and social groups reflects a mental map (a set of inherited assumptions) that we use to organise the world. It also reinforces those assumptions as we live each day. Our physical environment shapes how we think and vice versa.</p> <p>Thus the fact that I grew up seeing empty jam jars stored for the future made it seem natural to reuse them. Harvesting bilberries from moorland bushes prompted me to scan the ground around my feet (and recoil from litter). Later, being surrounded by the constant use and disposal of plastic bags in shops instilled a different mindset. </p> <p>The question we collectively face now is whether we can reshape our habits — and <em>habitus</em> — again. And as Josh Berson, an archaeologist and anthropologist, argues in a fascinating new book <em>The Human Scaffold</em>, the issue is not just about material goods: social, emotional and biological patterns also matter deeply. </p> <p>“Stuff is what's prominent in archaeological assemblages, not to say our own everyday lives,” he writes. “But that's a recent phenomenon. If we look at the deep history of human adaptation to climate change, we see stuff playing a subsidiary role.”</p> <p>Could the pandemic spark a shift? Possibly, given that even some of the elites are being forced to engage in a rethink (check out, for example, a book by Felix Marquardt, <em>The New Nomads</em>, on how he was once addicted to the Davos conference and lifestyle but is now kicking the habit). </p> <p>But for my money, it is the attitudes of the young that could prove truly significant. It is they who will have to live with the mess that we leave behind. No wonder they are fired up. </p> <p>And for those of us with folk memories of wartime rationing, we should celebrate the fact that culture can change when there is a need. All hail those reusable bottles, butter wrappers and discarded carrot stalks, especially on TikTok.</p> <p><em>Follow Gillian on Twitter&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gilliantett\"><em>@gilliantett</em></a><em>&#xa0;and email her at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=gillian.tett@ft.com\"><em>gillian.tett@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this column:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/693876d2-e126-44e9-a46a-de5552115802\"><em>Wartime is a dry run for a non-consumer society</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/693876d2-e126-44e9-a46a-de5552115802\"><em>From Pat Rogers, Riverside, CT, US</em></a></p><p>Source: Gillian Tett 2021 'I'm recruiting troops for the war on waste' FT.com 23 June.
