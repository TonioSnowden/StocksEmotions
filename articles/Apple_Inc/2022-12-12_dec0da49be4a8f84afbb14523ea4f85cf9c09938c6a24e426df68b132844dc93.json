  "text": "<p><em>Where There's a Will, There's a Wake</em> is ostensibly a podcast about death and its aftermath. “If you could plan your perfect death, what would you do?” asks the blurb for the new series, presented by the actor Kathy Burke, which gives you a broad sense of the tone. Guests are asked about how they would like to die, what they want at their funeral and arrangements for their will. It's all very jolly and irreverent.</p> <p>The first episode features comedian Dawn French, who says she wants to die on stage, “Tommy Cooper-style”, to laughter and applause. For her funeral, she would like a horse-drawn hearse, made of glass, and for the service to be conducted by RuPaul. French's comedy partner, Jennifer Saunders, would do the eulogy, though it will be written by the screenwriter Richard Curtis ­— the joke being that Curtis would be unfailingly complimentary, which would drive Saunders up the wall.</p> <p>Burke and French are old pals, which they probably think works in their favour but in fact, as with so many celebrity podcasts, their chumminess can be irksome. Too much time is spent chatting about when they last met and how much they adore one another. Couldn't they have got all that out of the way before pressing record? The second episode features the comedian Joe Lycett, who says he wants to die by being shot in the back of the head while lying in a hammock. He hopes his death will provoke the same level of national grief as David Bowie's in 2016.</p> <p>The death theme is intended to bring focus to what is essentially a celebrity chat show, which it does to an extent. But in both episodes so far, the conversations lack depth. At one stage, French remarks how, for much of her life, she didn't think she would reach old age, in part because her father died in his forties. A more curious host would have pressed the 65-year-old on this. French's father died by suicide when she was 19. How did this affect her? And how does she feel having lived 20-plus years longer than him? But Burke lets it pass.</p> <p>The dominance of the celebrity podcast has been one of the more disappointing developments in podcasting, and <em>Where There's a Will . . . </em>underlines a common flaw, which is that famous people don't make the sharpest interviewers. To sustain a 40-minute conversation, a host needs to prepare, listen, be curious and think about the listener at all times. The funeral scenarios in Burke's series are diverting enough, but even comedy needs light and shade.</p> <p>For real insight into death and grief, the award-winning series <em>Griefcast</em> is still going strong after five years. Hosted by Cariad Lloyd, it features people in the public eye talking candidly about their experiences of death and often laughing at the sheer bleakness it all. The series' ratio of silly to serious is just right.</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/where-theres-a-will-theres-a-wake/id1654059310\"><em>podcasts.apple.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2022 'Where There's a Will, There's a Wake — podcast about death could be livelier' FT.com 12 December.
