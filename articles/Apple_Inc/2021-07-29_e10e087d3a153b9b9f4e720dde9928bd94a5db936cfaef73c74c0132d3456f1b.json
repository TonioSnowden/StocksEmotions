  "text": "<p>Still, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley called the chip-shortage situation fluid. Tesla Inc., Volkswagen and Apple Inc. recently warned that the shortage could continue to disrupt production in the months ahead.</p><p>Ford has been especially hard hit by the computer-chip shortage that has curtailed global auto manufacturing since January. Company executives have pointed to the fallout from a fire at a chip maker in Japan in March, which exacerbated the problem for many of its suppliers.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ford's finance chief, John Lawler, said he sees the chip shortage improving during the third quarter, which should allow Ford to clear a backlog of orders for new vehicles, including the electric Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle and a new Bronco SUV that is just entering production.</p><p>\"We're spring-loaded for growth,\" Mr. Lawler said.</p><p>The brighter outlook comes as the U.S.'s second-largest auto maker by sales posted a $561 million net profit for the second quarter, as the strength of the new-car market helped offset hefty production losses from the continuing computer-chip shortage.</p><p>Ford also raised its full-year pretax profit guidance to between $9 billion and $10 billion, up from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion earlier.</p><p>Ford shares rose about 4% in after-hours trading following the results.</p><p>Auto executives and dealers have been navigating a turbulent market as the U.S. recovers from Covid-19 pandemic. The chip shortage and other supply-chain disruptions have led to bare dealership lots and sporadic factory shutdowns.</p><p>At the same time, new-car demand is booming as American car shoppers, flush with savings, look to take advantage of low interest rates and lofty values for their used-vehicle trade-ins. The pace of vehicle sales hit near-record levels in April and May, before cooling this summer as inventory problems worsened.</p><p>Rival General Motors Co. reports second-quarter financial results next week.</p><p>Ford said in April that it expects the semiconductor shortage to cause production losses of about 1.1 million vehicles this year, for a bottom-line hit of about $2.5 billion. But stronger vehicle demand and pricing, combined with lower-than-expected costs, helped lift results for the quarter.</p>",
