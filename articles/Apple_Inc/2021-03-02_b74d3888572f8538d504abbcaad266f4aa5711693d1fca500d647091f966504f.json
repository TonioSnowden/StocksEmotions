  "text": "<p>\n  Allow me to put this as nicely as possible, Rite Aid: I'd place your Covid-19 vaccine-booking website someplace between Horrible and Totally Horrible. </p><p>\n  First, I had to navigate through a corn maze of menus to find the actual booking page. Then, once I scored an appointment slot by clicking incessantly, and entered all the requested information, it vanished. </p><p>\n  \"The Covid-19 vaccine demand heavily outweighs supply,\" said a Rite Aid spokesman. \"When the appointments are made available they are filled quickly.\" An issue on the website, which didn't hold your appointment slot when you'd start to input your personal information, has since been fixed, he added. </p><p>\n  Congrats! You survived 12 months of pandemic! Now fragmented systems, shoddy websites and limited vaccine supply stand in the way of you and the rest of your life. </p><p>\n  It's one of the most important human-vs.-machine battles of our time. And it's made worse by the fact that most humans currently eligible to enter the fray are over 65 and not necessarily glued to a keyboard all day. </p><p>\n  But these systems are maddeningly broken, no matter your age or technical skill level. From national pharmacy chains to hospitals to local supermarkets, every Covid-19 vaccine-appointment website I've been to has made me feel like I'm bad at computers. And I've been reviewing computers for nearly two decades! </p><p>\n  So I set out to beat these Hunger-Game-like systems -- and help eligible family and friends in the process, much like the generous, tech-savvy volunteers booking appointments for those in need across the country. </p><p>\n  Along the way I met 34-year-old Kris Slevens, an IT guy who has booked over 350 appointments for New Jersey seniors. He let me into his process, which includes setting up a browser tool and adding a couple of browser extensions. In the subsequent week, I booked 11 appointments in five states, including Maryland, New York and New Jersey -- some on the websites of CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens. </p><p>\n  Does this mean you'll be able to score an appointment as soon as you read this? I wish. This whole thing is like a Vegas poker game: You can increase your odds with some skill and good timing, but a lot of it is luck. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Step 1: Find local social-media accounts </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Because the U.S. lacks a centralized sign-up system, everything is localized to the state or county level. What works in one place might not work in another. So Facebook groups have popped up in most states, with members who scout the local websites. </p><p>\n  Many groups, such as the one Kris moderates, help book appointments for in-need seniors. If you plan to ask for help from someone you don't know, be careful. Don't share highly personal information such as passwords or Social Security numbers. Having booked for many, I know that only basic contact info -- name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address -- is usually needed. </p><p>\n  Head to Facebook and search for your state and \"Covid vaccine.\" In the New Jersey, New York and Maryland groups, I found active members providing minute-to-minute updates, links and detailed spreadsheets about locations and appointments. </p><p>\n  People created Twitter accounts to provide updates on appointment openings. To see how other states work, I offered to help a Maryland couple in their 70s. I followed MDVaxAlerts and set up notifications on my iPhone. I was alerted to openings at a CVS and, within five minutes, booked two appointments. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Step 2: Learn the appointment websites </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  When you've picked a vaccine location, click to its website. </p><p>\n  Find the page that tells you whether appointments are available, and the page where you book an appointment. Yes, sometimes those are different. </p><p>\n  Once you have the links you want, bookmark them. I suggest using a laptop or desktop computer for all of this; working on a smartphone or tablet could slow you down. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Step 3: Set up autofill </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  In your browser, locate your autofill settings. This will allow you to store your full name, email address, home address and phone number in the browser. When it comes time to fill in all this, the browser will drop it in. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Step 4: Install browser extensions </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Appointments can disappear minutes after they're released, so in addition to the Twitter and Facebook resources, I've used two tools to try to catch them. </p><p>\n  The first is a browser extension called Page Refresh. It will refresh the page you're on every few seconds or minutes. I keep this open on my second monitor. It's available for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (and similar extensions are available for other browsers). The Page Refresh developer says the extension doesn't collect user data. One key tip: If you see an open appointment, stop the refresher ASAP. If it refreshes while you're inputting information, you could lose your place. </p><p>\n  That solution requires you to keep your eyes on the page. A tool called Visualping can do the watching for you. You tell the service's website or browser extension what website to monitor, then you highlight the part of the site that you expect to change -- in this case something that reads \"no appointments\" or \"appointments booked.\" If it changes, you get a computer notification or an email alert. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Step 5: Book </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  When that appointment pops up, move as fast as you can but not so fast that you don't read the messages and the prompts.Generally, you can skip adding insurance info. If it's needed, you can show it at the appointment. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  For links related to this column, visit WSJ.com/Tech. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Tips to Get a Shot </p><p>\n  At Pharmacy Chain </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  CVS: Start with the vaccine-screening tool, a questionnaire about you and your eligibility. At the end, you land on a page where you input your ZIP Code and search for appointments. Keep clicking the ZIP Code to see whether new appointments were added. If you get a slot, you'll be asked to fill out a questionnaire. Select \"Don't Know\" if you're moving fast and don't have time to read each question. For the East Coast, it seems big chunks of new appointments appear around 6 a.m. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Rite Aid: Start with the vaccine scheduler. After you've input your personal information in the scheduler, you'll get a list of local stores that offer the vaccine. You need to select a location and press \"Next\" to see whether there's availability. There are reports in many states of new appointments appearing around midnight Eastern Time. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Walgreens: Start with the vaccine-availability checker. Walgreens requires that you have an account to book. Make sure you remain logged in on your browser. Walgreens offers phone booking at 1-800-Walgreens. I have heard reports that new appointments appear at midnight. A spokeswoman said timing varies based on inventory and appointment availability. </p><p></p>",
