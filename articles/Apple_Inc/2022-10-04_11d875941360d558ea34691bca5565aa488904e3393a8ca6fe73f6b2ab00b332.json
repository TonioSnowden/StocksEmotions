  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA jumped 726 points, or 2.5%, to 30,216.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 100 points, or 2.7%, at 3,778.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 322 points, or 3%, to 11,138.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow surged rose 765 points, or 2.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 jumped 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%. The S&amp;P 500 enjoyed its biggest daily percentage gain since July 27 but remains down 22.8% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks kicked off Tuesday's session with explosive gains after the open, with the S&amp;P 500 index adding to its 2.6% bounce off 22-month lows that occurred on Monday. The Dow was on track for its strongest two-day point gain since April 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>See: Dow soars toward best 2-day gain in 2 1/2 years</p><p>Market strategists pointed to several factors helping to drive stocks higher. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said that while stocks had certainly reached oversold conditions, \"growing speculation that central banks could soon pivot towards a more dovish stance\" was also helping to boost stocks.</p><p>One factor that helped boost stocks was the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to delivera smaller-than-expected 25 basis point interest rate hike on Tuesday, which helped boost Asian stocks and also drove global bond yields lower.</p><p>After markets opened in North America, stocks extended their gains as data showed U.S. job openings fell sharply to 10.1 million in August, touching the lowest level since last fall.</p><p>The data suggested that the red-hot labor market might be cooling off a bit as interest rates rise and the economy slows, marking the latest example of the \"bad news is good news\" dynamic that has occasionally helped markets in recent sessions.</p><p>However, some cautioned investors not to read too much into this data, with Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, saying that the labor market has moved from \"extremely tight\" to just \"very tight.\"</p><p>Investors will hear more about the labor market on Friday, when the nonfarm payrolls data for September is released. Between now and then, investors will also receive updates from ADP's private payrolls report as well as the weekly update on the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits.</p><p>While the \"Fed pivot\" narrative received a lot of attention on Tuesday, many analysts said the move higher in stocks was more likely the result of stocks falling to oversold levels late last week since nothing has fundamentally changed to warrant a major pivot from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>\"It mainly looked to me like short-covering once again. We seem to see these types of moves pretty often, and maybe it turns into something, but I doubt it,\" said Michael Kramer, founder of Mott Capital Management, in a note.</p><p>Major stock indexes are mired in a bear market, but have seen sharp rallies, including a bounce of more than 17% by the S&amp;P 500 off its mid-June low before its latest leg down.</p><p>See: What does a pivot look like? Here's how Australia's central bank framed a dovish surprise</p><p>Stocks also benefited from lower bond yields, with the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y falling 1.2 basis points to 4.097% in recent trade after ending last week at around 4.28%.</p><p>The U.S. dollar has also continued to soften since reaching a 20-year high late last month, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY falling 1.2% to 110.41.</p><p>Read: A Bear Stearns moment awaits if actions like the Bank of England intervention don't calm markets, BofA analysts say</p><p>On Monday afternoon, New York Fed President John Williams, one of a \"troika\" of key Fed officials that includes Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Fed Vice Chairwoman Lael Brainard, struck a notably dovish note when he said he expected to see inflation recede to 3% next year.</p><p>See: Fed's Williams sees steep decline in inflation ahead</p><p>However, on Tuesday, Philip Jefferson, one of the three newest members of the Federal Reserve board of governors, used his first speech to say that high inflation was his biggest concern.</p><p>See: Fed's Jefferson, in first speech, says elevated inflation is his chief concern</p><p>While Williams' comments, the RBA rate hike and the U.S. JOLTS data could create an opening for any remaining doves on the Fed's policy-setting committee to argue for a slower pace of rate hikes, Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, said that the best bulls could hope for from the Fed would be a 50 basis-point interest-rate hike at the central bank's upcoming meeting in November.</p><p>Presently, Fed funds futures traders are pricing in more than 60% odds of a 75 basis-point hike, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.</p><p>Dutta added that the explosive rally in stocks feels a little like the New York Giants 3-1 record. \"This is great, but in the back of my mind I am thinking, this can't possibly last,\" he wrote.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Online secondhand-fashion marketplace Poshmark Inc. POSH has agreed to be bought by South Korean internet company Naver in a $1.2 billion deal, the companies announced late Monday. Poshmark shares jumped over 13%.</p><p>* Twitter Inc. TWTR shares surged more than 10% before being halted in midday trade on news that Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk was now proposing to purchase the social-media company at his original offer price of $54.20 per share.</p><p>* Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLAremained higher on the day, but erased some of their earlier gains, on news that the Twitter deal might close. Musk has agreed to borrow against his Tesla shares to help finance the Twitter deal. Tesla shares had struggled while the market rallied on Monday after the company reported disappointing deliveries numbers.</p><p>* Megacap tech stocks including Amazon.com Inc. AMZNand Microsoft Corp. MSFTwere up strongly, while Apple Inc. AAPLand Meta Platforms META rose, but lagged the broader market.</p><p>â€”Jamie Chisholm contributed reporting</p><p>Dow jumps over 700 points as stocks build on bounce to kick off 4th quarter</p>",
