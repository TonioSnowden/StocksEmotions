  "title": "Microsoft Faces EU Complaint",
  "text": "<p>The complaint, which OVHcloud filed last summer but hasn't previously been reported, alleges Microsoft's software doesn't work as well on other cloud services, making it harder for them to compete, the people said.</p><p>\"Through abusing its dominant position, Microsoft undermines fair competition and limits consumer choice in the cloud computing services market,\" said a spokeswoman for OVHcloud, whose formal name is OVH Groupe SAS.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesman wouldn't confirm whether the company was notified of the complaint, but said European cloud companies are building successful businesses using Microsoft products.</p><p>\"Cloud providers enjoy many options to provide cloud services to their customers using Microsoft software, whether purchased by the customer or the partner,\" the Microsoft spokesman said. \"We're continuously evaluating how we can best support partners and make Microsoft software available to customers across all environments, including those of other cloud providers.\"</p><p>OVHcloud said the complaint was filed jointly with several companies. It wouldn't name the other companies.</p><p>As governments around the world have gone after big tech companies, Microsoft hasn't been at the center of attention. The company has positioned itself as having learned from its own antitrust battles two decades ago when the Justice Department and the EU sued the company for its business practices.</p><p>Most of the government scrutiny has targeted the other four big U.S. tech companie -- Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc., Google-parent Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. A 2020 report by the U.S. House Antitrust Subcommittee aimed its 16-month inquiry at the market power of those other four companies, not Microsoft.</p><p>European policy makers and lawmakers moved recently to more closely regulate the cloud market. Even though Microsoft doesn't have a dominant cloud market share, there is a concern about the company bundling its strength in areas like business applications with its fast-growing cloud business.</p><p>Two other recent complaints in Europe alleged that Microsoft is bundling cloud products in an anticompetitive manner. In 2020, San Francisco business-messaging app Slack Technologies Inc. complained to the EU about Microsoft's bundling of its Teams workplace-collaboration product with its Office software. Last year, German cloud-storage company Nextcloud made a complaint to the EU about Microsoft's bundling of its OneDrive storage product with its Windows operating system.</p><p>After Nextcloud went public with its complaint, the company created a coalition of other European companies and nonprofits calling Microsoft out.</p><p>The EU is completely legislation that would designate several large U.S. companies, including Microsoft, as gatekeepers that would need to abide by new rules for how they deal with competitors and consumers. A second proposed law seeks to force tech companies to do more to police online content.</p><p>The fresh complaints against Microsoft are coming as it is seeking approval for one of its largest deals ever, with the $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc., which is facing scrutiny from regulators.</p><p>On Thursday, Microsoft President Brad Smith is scheduled to meet with Margrethe Vestager, the EU's digital-policy and antitrust czar. The European Commission said the meeting would take place online and cover \"issues within the digital portfolio.\"</p>",
