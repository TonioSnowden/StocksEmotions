  "text": "<p>British telecoms group Truphone, owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and his associates, is being bought for £1 by two European tech entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Truphone appointed restructuring specialist FRP Advisory to conduct a sale of the assets of the company after sanctions imposed on the Russian billionaire by UK and European authorities threw the group's future into doubt. </p> <p>The company was valued at £410mn in 2020 and has received more than £300mn in investment from Abramovich and his two Russian business partners Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov.</p> <p>Hakan Koç, a German businessman who co-founded the used car company Auto1, and his business associate Pyrros Koussios, a former telecoms executive and private equity investor, will own 90 per cent and 10 per cent of the company, respectively.</p> <p>The fire sale gives an early indication of the fate that is likely to befall companies that have become enmeshed in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Companies across the west that had imposed sanctions on individuals on their board, or among their owners and investors, have battled a litany of problems since the invasion in February, including a loss of customers, difficulty accessing finance and damage to their public reputations.</p> <p>Abramovich has been forced to sell Premier League football club Chelsea after being hit by sanctions, with a £4.25bn deal agreed last month.</p> <p>Truphone, in which Abramovich holds a 23 per cent stake and Abramov and Frolov most of the rest, has recorded 15 consecutive years of losses, including £16mn in 2020. </p> <p>The telecoms group sells contracts to corporate customers including banks that want a secure network and to avoid roaming charges for employees. It also provides embedded sims to a range of technology companies, including Apple. </p> <p>Koç listed Auto1, formerly backed by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, on the public market in Germany last year, raising €1.8bn and valuing the company at €10bn. </p> <p>Though Auto1 previously received funding from Target Global, a venture capital firm formerly run by Frolov's son, Koç says that neither he nor Koussios have a direct relationship with any of Truphone's current owners, and have never met them.</p> <p>As part of the sale, which is expected to complete this month, the current owners have committed to invest more than £10mn into the business, and will take on certain contractual liabilities, according to people familiar with the deal. </p> <p>One-off payments and debts — including a $660,000 fine from the US regulator the Federal Communications Commission linked to a misrepresentation of the company's ownership structure — will be paid by Truphone's existing owners. </p> <p>Under the arrangements of the sale, if the company performs well and crystallises its value through a market listing or capital raise, the current Russian owners will receive up to a third of the original funds that they invested, said people briefed on the deal. If Abramovich remains sanctioned at that time, he will not receive those funds. </p> <p>The proposed sale of Truphone to Koç was first reported by The Times.</p><p>Source: Anna Gross in London 2022 'Roman Abramovich-owned UK telecoms group to be sold for £1 to tech entrepreneurs' FT.com 3 June.
