  "text": "<h2>Spotify wants to meet all your audio needs</h2> <p>Can Spotify repeat the success of its podcast business by expanding into audiobooks? </p> <p>Since 2019, Spotify has gone on an acquisition spree to build out its podcast catalogue and creation tools, buying up podcast companies such as Gimlet Media and Anchor, the podcast advertising platform Megaphone and the live audio developer Betty Labs. </p> <p>The company is now expected to overtake Apple as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/spotify-bolsters-audiobooks-business-with-findaway-buy-2021-11-11/\">the largest podcast provider </a>by the end of this year, with more than 3m titles. Its US podcast audience is also forecast to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/\">surpass Apple Podcasts</a> for the first time this year.</p> <p>With its acquisition of the digital audiobook distributor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/spotify-expands-into-audiobooks-with-acquisition-of-findaway/\">Findaway</a>, it now looks like the streaming platform might follow a similar playbook for audiobooks. </p> <p>The company has already announced a partnership with the audiobooks platform Storytel, allowing existing subscribers to connect their account through Spotify to access their audiobooks within the music streaming app. Then there was that time it got celebrities to narrate classics such as Frankenstein, and had Daniel Radcliffe and others to read aloud <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21247804/harry-potter-daniel-radcliffe-reading-philosophers-stone-spotify-video\">the first Harry Potter book</a> at the start of the pandemic, exclusively for Spotify.</p> <p>Spotify does not currently stream audiobooks (the books above were presented as podcast episodes) but the Findaway deal, as well its partnership with Storytel, suggests that it might have designs on this business.</p> <h2>Does Audible need to watch out?</h2> <p>The global audiobook market is expected to be worth <a href=\"https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2021-jul/global-audiobook-revenues-set-to-eclipse-4bn-in-2021\">$9.3bn by 2026</a> from $4bn in 2020, according to research group Omdia. Amazon's Audible is the largest producer of audiobooks in the world, but there are a number of other platforms Spotify will also find itself competing against. </p> <p>Its partnership with Storytel looks a clever move given that the Swedish company has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/storytel-enters-us-with-acquisition-audiobookscom-2021-11-12/\">just announced its acquisition of audiobooks.com</a>, marking its entry into the US market. Storytel already has 1.7m subscribers in 25 markets with about 700,000 titles globally, and audiobooks.com is one of the leading audiobook services in the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Storytel is still a relatively small fish in a big pond. Kobo, which also sells ebooks and ebook readers, had ​​close to <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/kobo-ereader-news/over-2-million-new-users-have-registered-with-kobo-during-the-pandemic\">30m users globally</a> in 2020 and a presence in over 180 countries. Then there is <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4284165#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20Ximalaya%20had%20470,boasted%2035%20million%20overseas%20users.\">Ximalaya</a>, which has the majority share of China's online audio market with 80m monthly active users tuning in for podcasts and audiobooks (and don't forget that after the US, China's the second biggest country for audiobook revenue). </p> <p>Apple and Google also sell audiobooks, both with deep pockets and millions of people already using their wider services they can market to. These are just a handful of <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/the-best-audio-book-sites\">the audiobook sellers</a> out there.</p> <h2>Spotify's business model for books will be under the spotlight</h2> <p>Ultimately, whether Spotify can take on Audible and other audiobook sellers will depend on what its offering ends up looking like and consumer preference. &#xa0;</p> <p>“The audiobooks landscape is a complicated landscape that's getting more complicated as we see podcasts and audiobooks coming together in the same space,” Michele Cobb, executive director of the Audio Publishers Association, told me. The question at the front of her mind: “How will those with different business models come together?”&#xa0;</p> <p>Audible runs on a credit subscription model, where a user buys one title a month for a set price. Kobo, Apple and Google all sell audiobooks, book by book. These models are preferable for publishers as they guarantee they'll get a certain amount of money per book, she explains.</p> <p>Storytel and Scribd, another audiobook subscription service, offer unlimited subscriptions. These might appeal more to users, but they also dramatically reduce the average revenue per book. </p> <p>It is not clear yet how Spotify will sell audiobooks. Its huge user base (381m active monthly users) in theory should give it a head start. Offering exclusive content might also help. But if it offers audiobooks unlimited on its current subscription plan (as it does for music and podcasts), this could draw listeners away from the competition, even if it means getting used to ads between chapters.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Uber CEO flies into London as driver shortages hit app<br></strong>Dara Khosrowshahi flew into London for 24 hours earlier this week to tackle the company's driver crisis, as it faces <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb36db99-0e06-421e-b69a-71573cec387a\">a shortage of 20,000 drivers </a>ahead of the peak Christmas season. He pledged to raise driver pay 10 per cent. This comes after already promising £500 referral bonuses. We look at why the driver shortage has been caused by the “perfect storm” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d118350-ba42-43bb-9300-b81996227f5c\">here</a>.<strong><br><br>2. How will Facebook keep its metaverse safe for users?<br></strong>The man leading Facebook's push into the metaverse has told employees he wants its virtual worlds to have “almost Disney levels of safety”, but also acknowledged that moderating how users speak and behave “at any meaningful scale is practically impossible”. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d72145b7-5e44-446a-819c-51d67c5471cf\">That doesn't sound good . . .<br><br></a><strong>3. TikTok's also struggling with moderating its vast community</strong><br>A former TikTok moderator said workers were told to leave up videos showing <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/former-tiktok-moderator-asked-to-leave-up-disturbing-violence/13613958\">“disturbing” violence against Palestinians</a>.<br><br><strong>4. Japanese giant Toshiba announces break-up plan<br></strong>Japanese conglomerate Toshiba has confirmed plans to split the company into three separate companies, focused on infrastructure, semiconductors and devices. Toshiba has come under increasing pressure from activist investors to make changes since <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59229996\">an accounting scandal </a>in 2015.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Finally, don't underestimate Kenyan gamers</strong><br>A handful of pro-gamers are putting Kenya on the <a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/2088089/pro-gamers-are-putting-kenya-on-the-global-esports-map/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=daily-brief&amp;utm_content=9165ae6b-433a-11ec-9892-8a3383177167\">global esports map</a>.</p> <h2>Tech tools</h2> <p><br>Is the <strong>Apple Watch Series 7</strong> worth its hefty price tag (£369)? Probably not if you're upgrading from the Series 6 reckons the Guardian's Samuel Gibbs, as the only big differences are a bigger, better screen and faster charging. But “for those with worn-out models or looking for their first smartwatch for the iPhone, the Apple Watch Series 7 is the best you can buy”. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/10/apple-watch-series-7-review-bigger-screen-faster-charging-still-the-best\">five-star review</a> is worth a read.</p><p>Source: Rachel Banning-Lover 2021 'Spotify hints at move into audiobooks' FT.com 12 November.
