  "text": "<p>The apps for streaming services like Netflix and Hulu offer all the features of their TV-size counterparts, including closed captions, plus the ability to download episodes so you can watch on the plane, in the waiting room or in that endless pharmacy line without racking up data fees.</p><p>Gadgets like PopSockets -- sticky backed gizmos that expand and contract -- create a stable base for your phone so you don't have to hold it while you watch. And let us not forget that our phones are able to reproduce more than 16 million colors, offering a vivid escape that is only getting better with each new iPhone model.</p><p>-- Rachel Wolfe</p><p>Any list of Silicon Valley's greatest failures isn't complete without mention of Quibi, a $2 billion gamble by ex-Disney exec Jeffrey Katzenberg that argued humans would want to watch new TV series exclusively on their phones.
