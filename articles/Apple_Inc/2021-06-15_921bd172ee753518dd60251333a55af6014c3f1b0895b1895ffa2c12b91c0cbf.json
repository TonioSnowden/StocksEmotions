  "text": "<p>The move comes days after Democrats on the committee said they had learned that records from members and staff were seized by the Justice Department under former President Donald Trump in an apparent search for the source of leaks of sensitive information to the news media.</p><p>Apple Inc. told committee officials last month that the Justice Department had served grand-jury subpoenas on the tech giant in February 2018, when Mr. Trump had complained about leaks related to contacts between Russia and figures in his 2016 election campaign and then-special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into those ties.</p><p>Senate Democrats have called for Mr. Trump's attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, to testify under oath about the subpoenas, and the Justice Department's inspector general launched a review at Mr. Garland's request into whether the requests were improper.</p><p>\"There are important questions that must be resolved in connection with an effort by the department to obtain records related to members of Congress and congressional staff,\" Mr. Garland said. \"Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separation-of-powers concerns moving forward.\"</p><p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) said Monday that his committee would open a formal probe into the Justice Department's efforts during the Trump administration to obtain records from lawmakers and reporters. \"Congress must make it extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, for the department to spy on the Congress or the news media,\" he said. \"We cannot rely on the department alone to make these changes.\"</p><p>Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, gave the Justice Department a June 28 deadline to provide information about the subpoenas, including how and why they were issued and internal communications about them.</p><p>Messrs. Sessions and Barr have both said they weren't aware of any leak case in which subpoenas were sought for information related to lawmakers' records.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) issued what amounted to a warning to his Republican colleagues not to join Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee who have said they would subpoena the two former officials if they don't testify voluntarily.</p><p>\"There's no need for a partisan circus here in the Senate,\" Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor, adding the Justice Department's inspector general was \"fully equipped\" to determine whether the department's procedures were followed.</p><p>Besides the subpoenas relating to members of Congress, the department notified reporters at the Washington Post, CNN and the New York Times that, under the Trump administration, it sought and obtained their phone records from 2017.</p><p>Mr. Garland and other top officials met Monday with executives of those news organizations.</p><p>---</p><p>Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.</p>",
