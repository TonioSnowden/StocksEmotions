  "text": "<p>It's such a fine line, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15db8f16-a59d-11e3-8070-00144feab7de\"><em>This Is Spinal Tap</em></a> once taught us, between stupidity and cleverness. And it's one that <em>Cunk On Earth</em>, a new mockumentary series on BBC2, treads masterfully. </p> <p>The show is the latest to feature Diane Morgan's fictional, airheaded TV presenter Philomena Cunk — a character who first appeared on Charlie Brooker's satirical current affairs programme <em>Weekly Wipe</em> almost 10 years ago. Brooker has since moved on to bigger (and not necessarily better things) at Netflix, but he returns to co-write this latest Cunk spin-off in which she (mis)guides us through the entire story of human civilisation in five relentlessly funny episodes. If Cunk's vapid, uninformed schtick is something of a one-note gag, then it's one that continues to have perfect pitch.</p> <p>Each half-hour offers a madcap recap of a different age, from the ancient world through to the present day. Amusing alternate histories emerge based on the host's inexhaustible array of malapropisms — from the “cube and missile crisis” to “Vladimir Ilyich John Lennon's” imaginings of a world with no possessions. Momentous events and achievements are undercut by bathetic, irreverent observations. The Berlin Wall is described as a “divorce made of bricks”, the Titanic as “the world's first single-use submarine”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Some of the sharper moments revolve around Cunk's unknowing perspicacity. Often her guileless, reductive simplifications of history effectively illustrate absurdities and uncomfortable truths. The suffragettes, she surmises, fought valiantly for the right to vote “and choose which man would tell them what to do”, while the iPhone is described as such a feat of clean design that “even a child could make 50 an hour”. A throwaway comment about how South America and Asia “kept going in their own funny, foreign little ways” succinctly skewers the overly-western view of global history.</p> <p>Although few, if any, topics are treated as sacrosanct — the question of which of the Bible or the Koran is “better” is raised at one point — <em>Cunk on Earth</em> is less invested in provocation than parody. In fact, the show does such an exquisite job of sending up these kinds of sweeping BBC history documentaries (and the tropes they rely on) that you wonder how many viewers will tune in to what they might mistake for a pretty shoddily researched programme.</p> <p>Morgan's gift for deadpan comedy certainly appears to have wrongfooted various esteemed academics. Watching them scramble to come up with ways of gently correcting Cunk's misapprehensions or humouring her strange analogies is both excruciating and oddly touching. But while the experts generally come off well from their uneasy interviews, there is something about the Cunk character that is a little more sinister now than it once was.</p> <p>Whether she's telling a professor that she's done her own research about the moon not existing, or making a case that Jesus was the first victim of cancel culture, she suddenly seems less like a whimsical caricature than a plausible product of this age of misinformation and sensationalism. In these moments laughter can turn to dread. Fortunately, a great gag is never too far away.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On BBC2 tonight at 10pm; new episodes air weekly on Tuesdays and are on iPlayer. Available on Netflix outside the UK at a later date</em> </p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Cunk on Earth, BBC2 review — Diane Morgan's airhead narrates the history of the world' FT.com 20 September.
