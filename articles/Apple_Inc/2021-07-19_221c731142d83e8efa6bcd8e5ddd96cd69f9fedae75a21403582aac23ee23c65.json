  "title": "World News: Countries Tap Crypto Experts for Help --- Digital trend presents an opportunity to create virtual money for a whole nation",
  "text": "<p>Israeli crypto consultant Barak Ben-Ezer had never visited the Marshall Islands before 2018, when he flew halfway around the world to propose that the Pacific Ocean archipelago adopt a national currency he designed in the likeness of bitcoin.</p><p>The Marshall Islands represented a clean slate for financial innovation: A U.S.-supported nation of 59,000 people spread over more than a thousand islands, with no currency of its own and no central bank. A bank in Honolulu was its only link to the global banking system -- and access to the U.S. dollars used as everyday money on the islands.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Ezer told local officials the country could create and sell a digital currency of its own. It would be like bitcoin. People anywhere could invest in it, but with one important difference: It would be issued by a national government.</p><p>\"We told them bitcoin is amazing, but it's not a sovereign currency,\" he recalls. \"You are sitting on a pile of virtual gold.\"</p><p>David Paul, who was then a Marshall Islands cabinet member, had been studying cryptocurrency technology on his iPad. \"I didn't need much convincing,\" he said.</p><p>The government soon gave Mr. Ben-Ezer responsibilities more typically reserved for treasurers and lawmakers. Within months, the Marshall Islands Parliament overwhelmingly passed a law adopting his creation -- which he dubbed the SOV, for sovereign -- as legal tender, a crucial step toward its actual issuance.</p><p>Demand for digital-currency strategies in other countries has been supercharged by China's signals that it may be close to launching a digital version of the yuan. On Friday, Beijing said its e-CNY has been tested in more than 70 million transactions valued at over $5 billion.</p><p>Major central banks often have teams modeling digitization scenarios, though many are also quietly turning to engineers with experience in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, advisers say. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve has teamed up with such experts -- at Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- for the creation of a possible digital dollar.</p><p>Smaller economies may have more to gain and less to lose by taking a risk on a new type of monetary system, according to a book to be published in the fall by Cornell professor Eswar Prasad, \"The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance.\" Some smaller nations have been more public in tapping expertise from the crypto world.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Ezer's vision for the Marshall Islands was to make it the first nation to issue a tradable cryptocurrency, using it to attract new financial flows, much like tiny Panama used its canal to draw ship traffic, he said.</p><p>Bitcoin had long fascinated him, and he wanted to see a nation adopt something similar. With American degrees in computer science and economics, he had done technology work for the Israeli military and Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Under the approved plan, most of the currency stock would be issued free to the Marshallese government and its investment funds, with 10% of the total to be shared equally by the entire population.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Ezer's team would also get 10% of the issue, as payment for the years of work.</p><p>To make it work, he recruited veterans of the U.S. Treasury and the Bank for International Settlements, plus an expert in digital law from Malta.</p><p>But putting private advisers like Mr. Ben-Ezer into the driver's seat can raise questions about potential conflicts of interest and liability that are less evident when bureaucrats design systems.</p><p>The Marshall Islands plan then hit a snag in the form of First Hawaiian Bank, which threatened to sever its link as correspondent bank to the country if issuance of the currency went ahead.</p><p>Letters from First Hawaiian and between Marshallese officials seen by the Journal show the bank expressed concerns the currency could be used for nefarious purposes. The bank didn't respond to requests to comment.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund echoed the worry, saying in a March report that the currency \"could disrupt external aid and other important financial flows, resulting in a significant drag on the economy.\"</p><p>The currency hasn't been issued yet as a result of the concerns. The Marshallese politician, Mr. Paul, said the worries are misplaced. He said the currency's use of blockchain ledgers will make it secure and transparent. To him, blockchain resembles a monetary system used on the Pacific island of Yap under which massive limestone disks are hauled between households to represent changes in wealth, for all to see.</p><p>It is an ancient principle, Mr. Paul said, and \"the world has woken up to it.\"</p>",
