  "title": "Triago's Matthew Swain Sees Bumper Crop of Family-Owned Company Deals; Recently promoted to co-lead the Paris firm's Americas business out of New York, Mr. Swain says Triago's deal volume is surging",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Swain: Our deal volume will grow by 200% or 300% this fiscal year. Now seems like a great time, especially for family owned businesses, to bring in a private-equity sponsor, and we are taking advantage of that, raising capital, either for sponsors or operating teams that want to run these assets with more of an institutional lens. The volume of these deals is quite literally off the charts. If in the last fiscal year we did two, this year we will do close to 10 [of these direct primary deals].</p><p>WSJ Pro: What forces are driving that pace, at least from the seller's perspective?</p><p>Mr. Swain: [We're] at an interesting point coming out of Covid. A lot of [the principals in] these family-owned businesses say \"I want to take a step back.\" That's not to say they won't take a second bite of the apple, meaning that they won't roll a piece [of their equity] back into a deal. But they really want someone to come in and help them take the company to the next level and take some chips off the table. Aside from just taxes, culturally when Covid happened a lot of people went a bit more introspective on their lives to say \"my life could take a very different turn, very quickly. I'd like to enjoy some of what I've built.\"</p><p>WSJ Pro: What are the biggest concerns you hear most frequently from sellers about these deals?</p><p>Mr. Swain: It's legacy and their care for their own employees. You have to work a lot around getting them comfortable on how the business will change for the better, but at the same time that you're not going to hurt their brand or that you're not going to come in and cut a bunch of employees. These individuals are very emotionally attached to their companies.</p><p>WSJ Pro: How does your firm manage the pressure that this kind of robust market puts on talent retention?</p><p>Mr. Swain : No doubt, right now there is more volume than can be executed by the individuals in the market. We're doing two things. First, we're hiring bigger teams and training more junior folks coming straight out of investment banking into the secondary market. We're growing our internal farm team. The second piece is we're offering deal alignment that the big banks just can't necessarily offer. I came from a banking institution where you got paid [a bonus] once in March, and it was somewhat of a black box. For us, we are able to compensate people [with bonuses] on a deal-by-deal basis, and [also] allow them to build more meaningful equity in the overall business, so they feel vested in the overall firm.</p><p>Write to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
