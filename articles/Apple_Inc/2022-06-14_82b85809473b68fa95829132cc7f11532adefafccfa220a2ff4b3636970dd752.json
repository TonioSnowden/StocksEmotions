  "title": "Stitch Fix's New Look May Bomb; Online styling company embraces traditional e-commerce options as it looks to mend business model",
  "text": "<p>In early 2020, Stitch Fix hired former Bain &amp; Company consultant Elizabeth Spaulding to help expand its legacy \"Fix\" styling business with direct buying and international markets. Now leading the company as chief executive, she says Stitch Fix is in a deep period of transformation, warning it will be a nonlinear, iterative process. Last week, Ms. Spaulding said adding on-demand, personalized shopping has the potential to double or even triple Stitch Fix's market potential.</p><p>For the period ended April 30, Stitch Fix lost money, its revenue declined and, worst of all, some of its clients bailed. Less than nine months after Stitch Fix opened its a la carte shopping option to anyone, that business is growing just 13% year on year.</p><p>Stitch Fix appealed to tech investors by playing up its data and the algorithmic styling that data provided. But the reported $40 million to $60 million in cost savings from planned layoffs and other changes announced Thursday suggest some of Stitch Fix's human styling leaders may have been making generous six figure salaries for their decidedly unautomated work. It doesn't take an executive with two decades of consulting experience to realize that was a costly mistake.</p><p>Even for on-demand purchases, the company's value proposition is that it uses data analysis to offer personalization for customers. But on an earnings call Thursday, Ms. Spaulding said the company's new onboarding process was creating \"friction\" for those new customers eager for a \"Fix,\" or a box of styled items.</p><p>To order a Fix right now, a new customer has to answer a series of what can be upward of 40 questions as the algorithm works to hone their style. Privacy aside, in a world where urgency isn't just valued but expected, taking any kind of requisite quiz is likely a roadblock in and of itself for many potential customers. For a personal stylist, of course, information is key. But in the context of today's consumer who is highly focused on online privacy, Stitch Fix's questions—like weight, bra size, spending habits and birth date—seem overly personal.</p><p>Unfortunately, just as Stitch Fix is making major changes toward more traditional e-commerce, growth in the sector has taken a step back after a tremendous acceleration early in the pandemic. The online share of U.S. retail sales hit 15.7% in the second quarter of 2020, declining to 12.9% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. JPMorgan analysts are expecting the industry to face pressures this year from ongoing supply chain disruptions, a tight labor market, inflation and slowing discretionary spending.</p><p>Many of those consumers who are spending are moving back to bricks and mortar stores. Fewer customers online have meant acquiring those still online is more expensive. And Apple's changes have meant online targeting has become more difficult. It is in part for these reasons that many brands are starting to invest in technology in stores, rather than out.</p><p>Wall Street isn't expecting Stitch Fix to expand its clientele list annually until the April quarter of next year. To grow again, Stitch Fix may need to lower its barriers to entry; but doing so may take away any hope at a unique value proposition the company needs to compete in an e-commerce industry flooded by a sea of different models.</p><p>Stitch Fix may have walked its last runway in the spotlight.</p><p>Write to Laura Forman at laura.forman@wsj.com</p><p>Stitch Fix's New Look May Bomb</p>",
