  "text": "<p>Now, he's changed his mind. \"I no longer think cash is trash,\" said Dalio, in a late Monday tweet. \"At existing interest rates and with the Fed shrinking the balance sheet, it is now about neutralâ€”neither a very good or very bad deal. In other words, the short-term interest rate is now about right.\"</p><p>This is a view that investment bank Morgan Stanley has been espousing for some time. At virtually no risk, the 6-month Treasury bill BX:TMUBMUSD06M on Tuesday morning yielded just under 4%. That compares to the 1.74% dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 SPX, the 3.57% yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Yand the 2% yield on the iShares Core U.S. aggregate bond ETF AGG.</p><p>Granted, if the market turns higher, cash will be left behind. That's the risk/return tradeoff. Stocks rallied on Monday andstock futures were stronger early Tuesday. Dalio typically has a defter touch than, say, Jim Cramer, but perhaps his throwing in the towel on cash is the sign that now is the time to get out of it and put money to work.</p><p>The markets</p><p>After Monday's 765-point outburst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, U.S. stock futures ES00 NQ00 were pointing higher on the second day of the fourth quarter.
