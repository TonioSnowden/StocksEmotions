  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 696 points, or 2.3%, to 31,771.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX jumped 100 points, or 2.6%, to 3,931.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP rose 340 points, or 3%, to trade at 11,700.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 216 points, or 0.7%, erasing an earlier gain of more than 350 points. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each fell 0.8%. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen six of the last seven sessions and has shed 19.6% year-to-date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Deepening pessimism among investors could serve as a contrarian signal, setting the stage for some near-term upside, analysts said. A closely watched monthly survey by Bank of America showed global fund managers at their most pessimistic since 2008.</p><p>\"Stocks have been beaten down. That doesn't mean we won't see more downside for some stock markets around the world, especially given that earnings expectations are likely to be adjusted downward,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, in a note. \"But I believe we are far closer to the bottom than the top â€” and meaningful positive catalysts could present themselves in coming months.\"</p><p>The tone turned more positive Tuesday amid mixed corporate earnings reports after a report Monday suggested Apple AAPL was slowing hiring and spending which revived concerns that higher borrowing costs and rampant inflation were damping corporate confidence.</p><p>However, the rally was mirrored in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, as megacaps Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOG GOOGL bounced back from Monday's losses ahead of Netflix Inc.'s earnings due later today.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors are awaiting earnings from Netflix Inc. Investors will want to see if the company's outlook for subscriber growth has improved following a Wall Street Journal report that the company is engaging with potential advertisers for a planned lower-cost advertising-subsidized tier of content.</p><p>Read: Netflix is pulling out all the stops to reverse a slide in subscribers</p><p>Underpinning sentiment, however, and helping deliver gains on Tuesday, is a mostly positive second-quarter earnings reporting season, where 57% of those companies to have reported so far have beaten earnings per share and revenue expectations, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>IBM IBM results were not well-received, however. The tech company beat expectations, but worries about how a strong dollar may impact future earnings pushed the stock lower by 6.1%.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar retreated against the euro following reports that the European Central Bank is planning to interest rates by 50 basis points later this week, instead of the 25 it had initially signaled. The euro EURUSDwas up 0.5% against the dollar Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Concerns about economic growth are reflected in the U.S. bond market, too. As the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy, investors have pushed 2-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD02Y above 10-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, an inversion of the yield curve that is deemed a harbinger of potential recession. The curve remained inverted Tuesday even as Treasury yields rose by four basis points.</p><p>Data showed U.S. housing starts fell2% in June, while building permits were down 0.6%. Companies in focus</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ traded lower after the pharmaceutical and consumer health products company reported second-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations, offsetting a reduced full-year earnings outlook.</p><p>* Aerospace and defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT on Tuesday reported second-quarter results that missed analysts' profit and sales estimates.Shares edged lower by 0.1%.</p><p>* Shares of Arista Networks Inc. ANET rose 3.9% after a Needham analyst upgraded the stock to buy from hold Tuesday, citing the company's comparatively low international exposure and strong financial position.</p><p>* Hasbro HAS shares climbed 1% after the toymaker's earnings per share beat analyst expectations, though its revenue for the previous quarter were below expectations.</p><p>How are other assets faring</p><p>* U.S. crude futures CL.1 gained 1% to trade near $100 a barrel following reports that Russia's Gazprom hadclaimed force majeure on some buyers highlighted tensions in the energy space.</p><p>* The ICE Dollar index DXY fell 0.8%.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD rose 1.3% to trade near $22,590.</p><p>* Asia markets were mixed following Wall Street's overnight reversal.
