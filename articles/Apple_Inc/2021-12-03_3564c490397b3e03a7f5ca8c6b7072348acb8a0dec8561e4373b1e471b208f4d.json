  "title": "2022 Ford Maverick XLT: A Lo-Fi Hybrid Truck With a Nice Price; Starting under $20K, the Maverick packs a lot of practical utility into a compact pickup, writes Dan Neil",
  "text": "<p>The point is, the 2022 Ford Maverick is my kind of songbird: cheap cheap.</p><p>In the midst of what might fairly be called a crisis in vehicle affordability, the four-door hybrid-powered compact pickup hits the deck this month with an MSRP of $19,995â€”roughly $25,000 less than the average new-car price in the U.S., according to Kelley Blue Book.</p><p>These numbers are lit, brah. The Maverick seats five, gets 42 mpg in the city, carries up to 18 sheets of 4x8 plywood, tows a maximum 2,000 pounds, and wirelessly connects with up to 10 devices. That's so Gucci.</p><p>Ford expects the XLT ($27,695, as tested) will be the most popular trim level. Ours was kitted with oft-ordered options including spray-in bedliner; power eight-way driver's seat; full-size spare; and the Luxury Package with a heated steering wheel. Of such decadence my mother would say, \"That's for other people.\"</p><p>The soaring cost of transportation hits young wage-earners hardest. As part of its pitch to maker millennials, Ford encourages buyers to riff, to improvise custom accessories out of low-cost, home-store tools and materials. The cargo bed is provisioned with a clever assortment of tie downs, sliding/locking rails, pockets and threaded holes that buyers can use to DIY their own bike racks, ski racks, benches, boxes, false bottoms, camper tops and more.</p><p>And, in case you get a wild hair to install dance-party lights, connectors to the 12V system are accessible through small panels in the cargo bed.</p><p>This is cool. More of this please. The kids call it a \"collab,\" like between Dua Lipa and Elton John, except here it's between Ford CEO Jim Farley and the guy who delivers mom's medical marijuana.</p><p>Assembled in Ford's mega-works in Hermosillo, Mexico, la bonita camioneta behaves a bit like a Toyota Prius, for reasons I'll get to. The Maverick pickup uses a taut unibody structure, with the transverse-mounted 2.5-liter engine driving the front wheels through a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The underbits include MacPherson-strut suspension in front with a twist-beam suspension in the rear. Ford isn't reinventing any wheels here.</p><p>At 199.7 inches overall length, the Maverick is 32 and 50.3 inches shorter, respectively, than the comparable Ford F-150 and the heavy-duty F-250. For sure, nobody's towing a backhoe up a grade with the Maverick. Yet it has no trouble carrying a full-size ATV, according to Ford. So the question becomes, do you even have a backhoe?</p><p>Nested with the CVT is a permanent-magnet motor/generator contributing a maximum of 31 hp (system net is 191 hp), feeding and being fed by the small battery under the floor. Go ahead, turn the key (yes, the XLT still has an ignition key). Is it on? Very like a late-model Toyota Prius, the Maverick comports itself at slow speeds around town, from errand to errand, leaning on electrons as much as it can. Lift your foot from the accelerator or step on the brake and you will hear the soft swoosh of regenerative braking. Step on the go button hard enough and the 2.5-liter, 162-hp engine will awaken, joining the electric torques already in progress. All very smooth.</p><p>The Maverick feels light but solid, fun to drive, easy to park, eager to please. A peach. And don't worry too much about the CVT droning under hard throttle. With a 0-60 mph of 7.6 seconds, it doesn't have much opportunity.</p><p>Inside, the Maverick has much of the coziness of a Yeti cooler, with doors and dash encased in tough polycarbonate and seats jacketed in wipe-clean fabrics from the Outdoor Furniture department. I especially approve of the speckled material on the dash, much like the countertops in your better porta potties. The audio control and climate control are simple units with control dials; the eight-inch center touchscreen is small and limited, at least until it's connected to a smartphone via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.</p><p>In any event, the Maverick team's effort to rehabilitate industrial-grade plastic as hip and techy is pretty successful. The utilitarian innards also avoid the absurdity of work-and-play pickups with premium/luxury interiors, such as the recently reviewed Hyundai Santa Cruz. Good luck getting the chicken smell out of that.</p><p>Oh but the irony is killing me. The right-sized Maverick fills in white space created when Ford and other automakers departed for the land of the giants. At the beginning of the last decade, automakers received regulatory relief in the form of the \"footprint rule\" that held larger (and more profitable) vehicles to progressively looser fuel-economy standards. The argument then was that the automakers couldn't possibly meet the higher federal standards being contemplated.</p><p>In fact, Ford had a pretty good idea which way to go. The company spent more than a decade embroiled in a patent lawsuit with Paice LLC, a Baltimore-based pioneer in hybrid technology. In 2018, Ford agreed to settle with Paice for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>P.S.: Ford has said it will constrain production of the hybrid model to 40% of overall Maverick production, no matter how many preorders they have. How is that putting the customer first?</p><p>All-wheel drive is only available in the Maverick paired with the 2.0 liter, 250-hp four-cylinder engine and eight-speed transmission, for a total bump of $3,305. The Maverick's 4,000-pound towing package ($745) requires both. I would advise the target audience to eschew such upsells. That's how the Boomers getcha.</p><p>2022 Ford Maverick XLT</p><p>Base price: $22,280</p><p>Price, as tested: $27,695</p><p>Powertrain: Hybrid-electric gas system, with naturally aspirated 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four cylinder; continuously variable transmission with integrated motor/generator; front wheel drive.</p><p>Power/torque: 191 hp/155 lb-ft at 4,000 rpm</p><p>Length/width/height/wheelbase: 199.7/72.6/68.7/121.1 inches</p><p>Minimum running ground clearance: 8.3 inches</p><p>Curb weight: 3700 pounds</p><p>0-60 mph: 7.6 seconds (Motor Trend)</p><p>EPA fuel economy: 42/33/37, city/highway/combined</p><p>Passenger/cargo volume: 100.3/33.3 cubic feet</p><p>2022 Ford Maverick XLT: A Lo-Fi Hybrid Truck With a Nice Price</p>",
