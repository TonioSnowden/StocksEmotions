  "text": "<p>Booming demand for bourbon and tequila have delivered forecast-beating sales for Diageo. </p> <p>The distiller reported net organic sales up 1 per cent for the six months ended December, well ahead of the consensus forecast for a 4.6 per cent decline, as all regions improved versus the previous period. North America was the star performer, with sales up 12.3 per cent, while the company's high end Reserve portfolio delivered 15 per cent sales growth.</p> <p>Scotch, vodka and rum all saw organic sales declines but brands such as Bulleit and Crown Royal American whiskey compensated, while tequila was a notable outperformer with 61 per cent growth. Organic operating profit for the period fell by a narrower than expected 3.4 per cent.</p> <p>“The performance in the US was extraordinary in our view,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones. “This was an excellent set of results in trying circumstances. However, thinking back to the way Procter &amp; Gamble and Rémy Cointreau reacted to strong results last week, we wouldn't be surprised if the share price reaction is muted.” </p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>EasyJet </strong>said that cost cutting, including proposals to reduce employee numbers by up to 30 per cent, had lowered its cash burn in a fully grounded scenario to around £40m per week.&#xa0;The airline said it expects to fly no more than 10 per cent of last year's capacity in the current quarter and gave no guidance for the rest of the year.&#xa0;Passenger numbers were down 87 per cent to 2.9m last quarter, easyJet said. Total group revenue for the three months ended December fell 88 per cent to £165m. </p> <p><strong>Wizz Air</strong> reported a €116.4m net loss and a 76.5 per cent drop in revenue to €149.9m for the last three months of 2020. </p> <p><strong>De La Rue</strong> said positive trading and good progress with a turnround plan meant full-year results ending March will beat market expectations. The banknote printer targeted adjusted operating profit in the range of £36m to £37m versus market expectations of approximately £34m, largely driven by a strong currency division performance. De La Rue also announced an increased investment into polymer substrate manufacturing. </p> <p><strong>Tate &amp; Lyle</strong> reinstated earnings guidance, saying profit for its year ending March should be “modestly ahead” of the prior year. A lower tax rate meant adjusted earnings per share would be “well ahead” of the previous year, the food ingredients maker said. “Since consensus is currently below last year on both metrics, we expect significant upgrades,” said Investec analysts.</p> <p>Wealth manager <strong>St James's Place </strong>reported gross inflows for the fourth quarter of £4.02bn, up 1 per cent against the same period in 2019.</p> <p><strong>Britvic</strong> said it plans to rebuild investment in brands and routes to market and people during the drinks maker's fiscal second half starting April, but that profit growth will remain subject to the pace of the easing of lockdown restrictions. The soft drink bottler said total revenue was down 5.8 per cent to £328.1m on an underlying basis in the quarter ended December as lockdowns put pressure on sales in both the hospitality sector and on-the-go consumption.</p> <p><strong>Fevertree Drinks</strong> said full-year earnings would be better than previous guidance thanks to strong sales through grocers and its growing ecommerce business. The tonic water maker raised its 2020 revenue target to £252m, in line with expectations. </p> <p>Outsourcer <strong>Mitie</strong> said in a trading update that the national lockdown measures currently in place are likely to result in flat growth in its fourth quarter ending March. Fiscal third-quarter revenue was up 6.7 per cent to £573.9m, it said.</p> <p><strong>Rank</strong>, the casino and bingo hall owner, scrapped its interim dividend after reporting a £52.9m operating loss for the six months ended December. </p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Apple</strong> reported its highest-ever net profit in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39157bd8-12ac-4b54-b4e3-8d6432d8abf6\">the fourth quarter</a> as revenues surpassed forecasts to hit $111.4bn, driven by a 57 per cent rise in sales in greater China. Sales in all five of the company's product categories grew at double-digit percentages, led by a 41 per cent gain in iPad sales and a 30 per cent climb in its wearables unit, which includes AirPods and the Apple Watch.</p> <p><strong>Tesla </strong>is still struggling to generate consistent profit margins from selling its electric cars, leaving it reliant on sales of regulatory credits to lift its profits, according to figures released <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98344e83-086f-426b-97e7-ca8fc0e5033c\">late on Wednesday</a>. The US electric car maker reported results that topped Wall Street's expectations for revenue growth in the final quarter of last year but failed to hit forecasts for earnings, sending its shares lower in after-hours trading.</p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg warned of a growing competitive threat from Apple as <strong>Facebook </strong>posted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d4f14d0-a30e-43e5-a8fc-e680d15e3261\">record quarterly revenues</a>. The Facebook chief executive cited forthcoming privacy changes to the iOS 14 operating system as a threat to its ad business. “Apple may say that they're doing this to help people. But the moves clearly track their competitive interest,” Mr Zuckerberg said on Wednesday on a call with analysts.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Katie Martin</strong> <br>The spectacular melt-up of shares like&#xa0;GameStop demonstrates the power of a new group of stock market newcomers. “The biggest fund in the world now is [Reddit message board] wallstreetbets in terms of its ability to move markets,” one baffled hedge fund manager told <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcfb2252-f752-4177-a860-07dc66b0b9e8\">our markets editor</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/runawaymarkets\"><em>This article is part of the FT's Runaway Markets series</em></a></p> <p><strong>Lombard</strong> <br>It is a measure of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1b0e18b-ba45-4ba0-a31c-a2123a3924e1\">dysfunctional markets</a> that day traders delivered a bigger return for Pearson shareholders within 90 minutes than John Fallon ever managed in seven years as chief executive.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
