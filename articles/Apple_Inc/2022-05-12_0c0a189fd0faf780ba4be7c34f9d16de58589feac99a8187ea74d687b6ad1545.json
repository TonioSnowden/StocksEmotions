  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Personal Technology:  Apple Killed the iPod. Here's Why It Should Live On.  ----  By Joanna Stern",
  "text": "<p>\n  It wasn't an easy phone call, but someone had to break the news to Ann Pfund, a devoted iPod owner from Austin, Texas. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Me: The iPod is dead. Apple is discontinuing it. </p><p>\n  Ann: Yes, it's just awful. It's a very sad day for music lovers like myself. I have had an iPod in some form or another since 2004. </p><p>\n  Me:  What will you do? </p><p>\n  Ann: Probablysearch eBay for used ones. </p><p>\n  Me: I'm here for you. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  On Tuesday, Apple announced it was officially over the iPod. After more than 20 years of click wheels, play buttons and enough color options to fill a Sherwin-Williams store, the company said the current iPod Touch, first introduced nearly three years ago, is only \"available while supplies last.\" </p><p>\n  At this point you likely have one of two reactions: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- \"They still make iPods? I remember my first one. The one with the wheel. I took a 50-page book of CDs and fit them all in there.\" </p><p>\n  -- \"Why, why, why? I love my iPod. It's so much better than the iPhone, Spotify and all that dumb streaming stuff. UGH!\" </p><p>\n  I have heard a lot of the latter over the past few months. </p><p>\n  Every Friday in my Tech Things newsletter, I feature a \"Throwback Thing,\" an old tech product submitted by readers. </p><p>\n  The most common submission? iPods! And it isn't just that people have them sitting in their personal tech museums. They still use these old music players in their cars, in their living rooms and on their runs. </p><p>\n  This lingering devotion makes sense. </p><p>\n  The iPod and the iTunes music store may have given way to all the smartphones and streaming services on which so many of us are now stuck, but that doesn't mean the newer arrivals are better. </p><p>\n  In fact, my new friends have me convinced there's a lot to love about a dedicated music player. </p><p>\n  So it's with their sentiments that we send off this beloved and world-changing product. </p><p>\n  (Cue the Sarah McLachlan. . .) </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  No distractions </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Most who cling to their iPods agree: No internet is pretty great sometimes. </p><p>\n  No notifications interrupting your music, no Twitter or Instagram tempting you just a tap away, no cluttered streaming-service interface with artists and albums begging, \"Listen to me! Listen to me!\" </p><p>\n   Daniel Koenig from Columbia, Mo., who uses a purple 16GB fifth-generation iPod Nano, said he loves music more with the iPod than he ever did when he used Spotify. </p><p>\n  He said buying music and putting it on a separate device means he has a stronger connection to it, like it's his music. </p><p>\n  And listening without incessant notifications pinging away? He and others told me that on their iPhones, even if they turn on Do Not Disturb, they still feel that temptation to jump to other apps. </p><p>\n  \"Music seems more special and important when I listen to it and devote all my attention to it,\" he said. He likes putting on a playlist, gazing out the window \"while my mind spaces out.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Long battery life </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  You know what Ms. Pfund didn't need when she took a 19-hour flight to South Africa for her honeymoon? A charger for her sixth-generation iPod Classic, which she bought in 2007. Its battery life was originally listed as 40 hours for music playback. </p><p>\n  She also didn't have to make sure she had enough music downloaded for offline playback before takeoff. It's all just there on its 160GB hard drive. Yes, it's a spinning drive, and, yes, she said she loves the feel of it gently whirring in her hand. (Nothing makes me more nervous than a spinning hard drive in 2022, now that more dependable solid-state drives are all the rage, but you keep living on the edge, Ann!) </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Lots of space </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Ms. Pfund said she has 40GB of music on there. The iPod is still only a quarter full, but all that music would clog her iPhone. She said she doesn't want to worry about it, or feel compelled to spend more to get an iPhone with the maximum amount of storage. </p><p>\n   Murray Berkowitz of West Palm Beach, Fla., has an iPhone XR with a little under 20GB of remaining storage. Meanwhile, his fifth-generation iPod Classic can hold 30GB. He, too, has decided to keep using his iPod to play music, especially in his car. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Small and durable </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Jim Fantazzia of Horsham, Pa., often takes the original iPod Shuffle on walks. Resembling a white stick of gum with buttons, he said it's lightweight, and there's no screen to break. Yes, he admitted he has dropped it many times over the years. </p><p>\n  Of course, no screen means no interface for selecting songs. That's part of the thrill, Mr. Fantazzia said. \"I like that it takes out a guessing game as far as what I want to listen to, I just hit play and let the Shuffle do its thing.\" </p><p>\n  When I heard the news, I called up Tony Fadell, a former Apple senior vice president who is credited with inventing the iPod. I asked him what he had to say to people who just want something as simple as his 20-year-old invention. </p><p>\n  He said the iPod's demise was inevitable, for business reasons. However, he thinks there's real value in a dedicated audio player without all the distractions of the internet. \"I do believe the iPod should go on,\" he added. </p><p>\n  (OK, now cue the Celine Dion. . .) </p><p>\n  My advice? Follow Ms. Pfund over to eBay. I don't think iPods will ever go out of fashion there. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Cordilia James contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
