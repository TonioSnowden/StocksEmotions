  "text": "<p>   A number of the remarkable gardens featured in Carolyn Mullet's new book \"Adventures in Eden: An Intimate Tour of the Private Gardens of Europe\" were designed by their owners. In 2016, the Russian landscape designer Alexandre Grivko transformed a property on the coast of Normandy into Les Jardins d'Etretat, full of topiary plants and sculptures -- including a statue of Claude Monet, who painted the area's cliffs a century earlier. For gardener Keith Wiley and his late wife Ros, creating Wildside in the English county of Devon involved moving 110,000 tons of material to turn a former apple orchard into mini-valleys with painterly riots of color. </p><p>   Other gardens in the book were wrested from challenging terrain. Carl Wright quit his job to create a garden in the limestone fields of western Ireland, full of daylilies, hazel and 150 varieties of fern species and cultivars. The area is \"wet, windy and virtually soil free\" and \"about as difficult as it gets,\" he says. </p><p>   Sometimes a sense of humor helps. Bryan's Ground in Herefordshire, England, has a walk named after the owner's beloved Labrador retriever, as well as a dog sculpture and a dog-bone-shaped formal pool. According to Helene Lindgens, who with her husband created a garden on the Spanish island of Mallorca, \"Gardens are a school of life. I learned patience, tolerance and humility.\" </p><p></p>",
