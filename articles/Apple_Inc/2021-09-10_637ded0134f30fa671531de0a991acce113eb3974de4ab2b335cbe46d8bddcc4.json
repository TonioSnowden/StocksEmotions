  "text": "<p> I was disappointed to hear of Apple's recent decision to delay the launch of its child sex abuse detection code after a backlash from privacy campaigners (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c17ca8b-da7c-4cd0-8f04-9ef82f608b25\">Report</a>, September 4).</p> <p>While Apple's proposed child safety initiatives were imperfect — and significant room exists across the tech sector to improve detection, disruption and reporting of child sexual abuse — Apple's changes represented a positive step forward. </p> <p>The world should not elevate the hypothetical and unlikely corruption of child safety solutions over the known and rampant misuse of existing technology to harm children. </p> <p>We see first-hand the brutal impact of undetected abuse on children. The voices of survivors must be heard in the debate around privacy as their own privacy rights are grossly violated by systems allowing this crime to flourish.</p> <p><strong>David Westlake</strong><br><em>Chief Executive, International Justice Mission UK, Witham, Essex, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Apple cannot let privacy trump its child safety code' FT.com 10 September.
