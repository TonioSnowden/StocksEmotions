  "title": "As Mississippi River Flooding Gets Worse, 100 Mayors Try a New Fix; River cities partner with hunting group and others to store water in natural areas, potentially reducing by 10% the chances of a levee overtopping",
  "text": "<p>The hunter-supported conservation group this year formalized a partnership with a group representing some 100 mayors along the Mississippi. Their goal is to restore thousands of acres of wetlands at key points along the river to hold floodwaters and reduce by 10% the chances that a future, higher flood will result in levees being overtopped.</p><p>\"This is just one small project, but as you add these up—40 acres at a time, 100 acres at a time—you start to put together a chain of wetlands and we can start to have some positive impacts,\" Mr. Sertle said. </p><p>A new berm near the Big Muddy in Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois.

Academics and environmentalists said the only way to prepare for the future was to find ways to give the rivers more room by turning natural areas into wetlands with work like Mr. Sertle's and by moving back levees, which could eat up farmland.</p><p>Past flooding showed, they said, that the extensive systems of levees, dams and reservoirs that protect cities and towns along the rivers were being pushed beyond their limits by the bigger, more frequent floods arriving with more extreme weather patterns brought on by climate change.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>If you live in an area prone to flooding, what steps are officials taking to address flood control? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Farmers were reluctant to sell productive land and no one knew if there were enough natural areas to soak up the amount of water needed.</p><p>\"In the past, what everybody tried to do was build a Great Wall of China around whatever they owned. That may work slightly for them in the short term, but for other people, it doesn't work at all,\" since it sends more water downstream, said Phil Stang, mayor of Kimmswick, Mo., whose main road in and out of town has been cut off by a temporary levee multiple times during floods in recent years. </p><p>Phil Stang, mayor of Kimmswick, Mo., standing on a new dock for riverboats that was built with flood resilience in mind.

Farmers, frustrated by working lands that flood more and more often, offered up 26,000 acres—more than the USDA could buy.</p><p>\"It's part of our new normal under the climate-change conditions we're facing,\" he said.</p><p>In Atchison County, Mo., the local levee district agreed to rebuild a Missouri River levee about half a mile behind the old one after the area flooded in 1993, 2011 and 2019, adding about 1,000 acres to the floodplain.</p><p>The Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, the group representing riverside mayors, was looking to convert some lands near the confluence of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers into flood storage in 2016, when it realized that Ducks Unlimited was looking at creating wetlands on those very same lands, said Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the mayors' group.</p><p>\"It was like, 'Ding!' A big light turned on. If you're going to flood them for ducks, could you flood them for us?\" he said.</p><p>The two groups began to partner on projects, knowing that creating more areas for the river to spread out would be helpful, but unsure by how much.</p><p>In 2019, Aditya Ranade, a partner in a climate-change-focused environmental consultancy called Two Degrees Adapt, set out to answer that.</p><p>Mr. Ranade recently announced the group's headline conclusion that restoring a total of 60,000 acres of wetlands near Davenport, Iowa, St. Louis and Cairo, Ill., would be enough to reduce by 10% the chances a flood will overtop levees in those cities for a flood that has a 1% chance of hitting in 2030. </p><p>Members of the Illinois National Guard moved sandbags on Main Street in Grafton, Ill., in June 2019, the third time that spring the town was hit by flooding. PHOTO: Whitney Curtis for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>\"Five years ago, this work couldn't be done because the data didn't exist,\" Mr. Ranade said.</p><p>It should take five to seven years and cost $150 million to reach that goal, according to an estimate by Ducks Unlimited.</p><p>Mary Hostetter, owner of the Blue Owl Restaurant in Kimmswick, has had to completely clean out her restaurant twice to prepare for floods. She named her signature item after the flood flight of 1993: The Levee High Caramel Apple Pecan Pie.</p><p>She said the last two years, including the 2019 flood and the coronavirus pandemic, have been hard on the restaurant and the town. She said she would welcome any cut in future flooding. \"It's always in the back of my mind,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Joe Barrett at joseph.barrett@wsj.com</p><p>As Mississippi River Flooding Gets Worse, 100 Mayors Try a New Fix</p>",
