  "title": "Crowds Are Back, so Get Ready  To Share Times Square Again  ---  Release from pandemic seclusion comes  with resurgence of city's annoyances  ----  By Charles Passy",
  "text": "<p>   During New York City's lockdown, Richard Gowan, a 42-year-old resident of Brooklyn, N.Y., took solace in the fact that the streets were blissfully quiet. \"You felt like you could hear the birds singing,\" he recalls. </p><p>   When he was recently on a bus stuck in a traffic jam, he realized those days are gone. Even the 7-year-old New Yorker next to him knew it. \"New York is coming back to New York,\" his daughter, Ivy Barrette-Gowan, remarked. </p><p>   New York City, like most of America, is reopening. That means a joyous release from seclusion back into public spaces -- and all the crowds, noise and annoyances that come with the return. For big city residents -- especially those who stayed put when many of their neighbors left for more space -- that means readjusting to sharing spaces that once felt almost private. </p><p>   Stefani Jackenthal, a 54-year-old New York resident, is a water-sports enthusiast who frequently takes her surf-ski kayak and stand-up paddle board on the Hudson River, the busy waterway that runs along the west side of Manhattan. </p><p>   Usually she has to dodge the ferries, barges and pleasure boats that ply the waters. At the beginning of the pandemic, Ms. Jackenthal says she could make the roughly 7-mile trip from her Manhattan launch point to the Statue of Liberty with barely a care. \"There was nothing in my way. The quietness was insane,\" she says. </p><p>   And now? \"Everything is back,\" says Ms. Jackenthal, referring to the boat traffic. </p><p>   Adrienne Lenhoff, a 53-year-old resident of suburban Detroit, says she was struck by the lack of lines at her local supermarkets, especially her normally bustling Trader Joe's, where she often heads for granola and dried fruit, among other favorite items. But Ms. Lenhoff says the queues have returned. </p><p>   \"Over the last couple of weeks, I started having groceries delivered,\" she says. There's a silver lining: Ms. Lenhoff says she is saving up to two hours by skipping her trip to the market, leaving her more time to exercise or hang out with her college-bound daughter. </p><p>   Tim Akimoff, who travels throughout Oregon in his job as a conservation communications specialist, says the slow days of the pandemic gave him a chance to hop on the Wallowa Lake Tramway, a popular aerial attraction in his state. Mr. Akimoff, 47 years old, says when he had been near the cable ride for work before the pandemic, it was too crowded for him to quickly get a spot. </p><p>   Last year, \"I drove over one morning, and there was no line,\" he recalls. The experience was more than worth it, he adds: \"I just leisurely wandered around this beautiful mountaintop.\" </p><p>   For Kelly Reeves, a 49-year-old resident of Newport Beach, Calif., who lives near the freeway, the resumed noise of traffic is compounded by the increase in the number of planes thundering above her neighborhood. </p><p>   She says she had started to become accustomed to doing her early-morning meditation \"in pure silence\" during the pandemic. </p><p>   \"It allowed me to do a deeper meditation,\" she says. She could also concentrate better on her copywriting jobs during the day. \"I could work with my windows open for the first time ever,\" she says. </p><p>   Ms. Reeves says her solution to deal with the world \"getting back on its axis\" in recent weeks is simply to close her windows -- and she now listens to music while meditating to help cancel out the noise. </p><p>   Jeff Ransdell, a 51-year-old resident of Miami, said all the newcomers in town over the past year have made getting reservations at some of his favorite restaurants a challenge. \"Anything in Miami Beach has been impossible,\" he says. </p><p>   Not that Mr. Ransdell, who heads his own venture-capital firm, is going hungry. \"I end up going to my second or third alternative,\" he says. </p><p>   Beth Harpaz, a 60-year-old Brooklyn, N.Y., resident, says she can't wait for the full return to normalcy. Ms. Harpaz is a volunteer with Big Apple Greeter, an organization that helps guide visitors to New York, and says she is eager to welcome back tourists now that the city has become busier. But she also recalls the days last year when she could view the works of some of her favorite artists, including Monet and Chagall, at the city's nearly empty museums, almost as if she had a private audience with the painters. </p><p>   \"This was like the only gift the pandemic could give to me,\" she says. </p><p></p>",
