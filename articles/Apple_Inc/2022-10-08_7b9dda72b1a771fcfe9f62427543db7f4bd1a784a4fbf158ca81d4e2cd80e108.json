  "text": "<p>   Some consumers can already get certain streaming services free through their wireless carriers or cable providers. </p><p>   T-Mobile now offers both free Netflix and Apple TV+ and a year of free Paramount+ for subscribers on its top-tier unlimited wireless plan. </p><p>   Porsche Bright, a 41-year-old social worker from Riverview, Fla., has access to six streaming services, but she pays for only three of them, since she gets her Netflix and Paramount+ subscriptions through T-Mobile. </p><p>   The challenge for streaming services that participate in such partnerships is ensuring consumers know about -- and use -- what they have. </p><p>   Mr. McKee, the New Jersey teacher, recently learned he could be getting Netflix, free of charge, through his T-Mobile subscription. \"With all of these bundles, you could have access to these services and not even know,\" he said. </p><p>   Verizon Communications Inc., meanwhile, offers the Disney bundle free to customers on its priciest mobile-phone plans. The two companies have been partners since Disney+ launched in 2019. </p><p>   Under terms of their initial deal, Verizon and Disney shared the cost of providing the service, which had a $6.99-a-month sticker price, according to people familiar with the pact. Verizon then earned a portion of revenue from people who became paying subscribers at the end of the 12-month promotion, the people said. </p><p>   BritBox International, a smaller streaming service that has participated in bundles in overseas markets, said acquiring a customer through a bundle is only part of the challenge. The real goal is to turn those bundle subscribers into active users. \"That's pretty much the highest determinant of whether or not they will stay a subscriber\" when it runs out, said Reemah Sakaan, CEO of BritBox International. </p><p>   Another way for streaming services to increase their chances of getting new customers is to be part of new marketplaces that are taking shape. Verizon is building a new system, called Plus Play, that lets customers manage streaming subscriptions, including Netflix, Disney+ and Peloton -- and potentially new bundles, in one place. </p><p>   AT&amp;T Inc. is developing a similar marketplace, said people familiar with the matter. And YouTube is pitching streaming services on a marketplace it is developing that would make it easy for consumers to add new subscriptions. </p><p>   If bundles do become widespread again, says Frank Boulben, chief revenue officer of Verizon's consumer group, \"it won't be at the expense of the customer; it will be because the customer values it.\" </p><p></p>",
