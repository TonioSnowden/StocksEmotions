  "text": "<p>    Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook has said the company's greatest contribution to mankind will be in health. So far, some Apple initiatives aimed at broadly disrupting the healthcare sector have struggled to gain traction, according to people familiar with them and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   Apple has envisioned an audacious plan for healthcare, offering its own primary-care medical service with Apple-employed doctors at its own clinics, according to people familiar with the plan and documents. To test that and other bold healthcare ideas, it took over clinics that catered to its employees and built a team with scores of clinicians, engineers, product designers and others. </p><p>   Today those ambitions, which aren't widely known, have largely stalled as Apple has shifted the focus of its health unit to something it knows well: selling devices, specifically the Apple Watch, according to people familiar with its strategy. </p><p>   The new primary-care service hasn't gotten off the ground, people familiar with it said. A digital health app launched quietly this year has struggled to keep users engaged, said people familiar with the app and the documents seen by the Journal. Some employees have raised questions internally about the integrity of health data coming from the company's clinics that has been used to support product development, according to people familiar with their concerns and the documents. </p><p>   An Apple spokesman said data integrity is the foundation for all of the company's innovations. He pointed to the accomplishments of its health team and said the company is still in the early innings of its work in healthcare, adding that new technology such as heart-rate notifications in products like the Apple Watch have improved users' health. He said data gathered by Apple's devices is enabling new research that has the potential to improve care. </p><p>   \"Many of the assertions in this report are based on incomplete, outdated and inaccurate information,\" the spokesman said. </p><p>   Looking for new markets where technology can improve efficiency and outcomes -- and power sales growth -- the tech sector has eyed healthcare as an untapped opportunity. Some of tech's biggest efforts have failed, including Haven, Amazon.com Inc.'s high-profile partnership with other companies that aimed to reduce healthcare costs. Today, Amazon has a new effort to sell prescriptions and a plan to launch virtual care across 50 states. </p><p>   Under Mr. Cook's leadership, Apple has increased its research-and-development budget eightfold to $20 billion annually, according to its public filings. And besides a smartwatch, the company has released wireless headphones as well as new services. It has also invested heavily in health, autonomous driving and augmented reality, all technically complex, high-stakes areas, meaning that game-changing offerings could be years away or never come. </p><p>   One of its most ambitious healthcare ideas was a plan to offer primary-care medicine, conceived in 2016, according to documents and the people familiar with the plan. An Apple team spent months trying to figure out how the flood of health and wellness data collected from users of its smartwatch, first released in 2015, might be used to improve healthcare, the people said. </p><p>   Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who oversees the health team, urged employees to think big. He said Apple should disrupt what he called the \"363\" and \"break fix\" model of care in the U.S., where patients might not see their doctors 363 days a year and visit only when something goes wrong, according to people familiar with his ideas. </p><p>   If Apple could prove that its combination of device sensors, software and services could improve people's health and lower costs, the company could franchise the model to health systems, according to the documents. </p><p>   To start, Apple took over employee health clinics near its headquarters that were being run by a startup and turned them into test beds for new health services, said people familiar with the changes. In 2017 it hired Dr. Sumbul Desai from Stanford University to run the effort, which was given the code name Casper, said the people familiar with the plan. The effort continues today, but Apple has struggled to move Casper past a preliminary stage, said people familiar with its operations. </p><p>   Dr. Desai's unit in particular has seen multiple departures by employees who said its culture discourages critical feedback, which is potentially problematic for a unit focused on products and services related to personal health, according to people familiar with its culture and the documents. Some employees expressed concerns that internal data about the clinics' performance, data that was recently used to support the rollout of a new digital health app, has been inaccurate or compiled haphazardly, according to the documents and people familiar with the data. </p><p>   Apple's spokesman said such criticisms are inaccurate. </p><p>   The spokesman said the company is proud of Dr. Desai's work and that she has been instrumental in much of its healthcare work. </p><p>   Mr. Williams and Dr. Desai didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   A recent initiative for Dr. Desai's team, a digital health app called HealthHabit that is being tested on California-based Apple employees, has struggled with low engagement since the app's launch about six months ago, according to documents and people familiar with the app. </p><p>    HealthHabit offers to connect people with clinicians, encourages them to set and meet health goals and can connect them to health coaches. </p><p>    Half the people who had downloaded it as of May hadn't enrolled, according to the documents and people familiar with the app. </p><p>   Data supporting the app's hypertension program has caused concerns among some employees. In a March presentation, Mr. Williams showed data indicating that 91% of patients in Apple's clinics with more severe stage two hypertension improved to healthier stages or normal, according to documents reviewed by the Journal, a figure that some employees feared could overstate the clinics' success, according to people who attended the meeting. Rival companies offering hypertension apps have disclosed lower rates of success. </p><p>   Apple said other companies analyze their  data differently and that the data cited by Mr. Williams was for an internal pilot, not a product. </p><p></p>",
