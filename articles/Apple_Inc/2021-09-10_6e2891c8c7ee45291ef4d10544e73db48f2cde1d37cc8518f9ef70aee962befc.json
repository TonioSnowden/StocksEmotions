  "text": "<p>I've been in Paris now for almost two years. Before that I lived practically everywhere – I went to England for boarding school, Princeton for university, back home to Paris for a bit, then to Mexico City and London, where I lived for 15 years. So in a way I'm a bit of a tourist in Paris – except that I'm French, of course.</p> <p>These days I live in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, on the Left&#xa0;Bank of the river Seine. I&#xa0;grew up nearby in the 7th arrondissement, but Saint-Germain has a different feel. It's&#xa0;full of local shops that each have their own speciality – a&#xa0;crémerie for cheese, a stall for fresh fish – and there's a&#xa0;market every Sunday on Boulevard Raspail. Everything in&#xa0;Paris is organised around the river. By walking along the quays, you really get to experience all the neighbourhoods. If&#xa0;I want to be around nature I'll go&#xa0;to Jardin des Tuileries, where I&#xa0;take Lily, my dog, for a walk almost every day.</p> <p>One of Paris's great rituals is starting your day at a café. In other cities you usually go for a coffee to catch up with friends. But in Paris you go on your own. Half the tables at a café will be full of people reading or writing. It's a habit I've returned to since moving back here; <a href=\"https://cafedeflore.fr/menu/?lang=en\">Café de Flore</a> needs no introduction but I&#xa0;love going because it's so close to my house. And there's a real tradition of the <em>habitué</em> in France – if the waiters don't know you, they give you the worst table. Come three days in a row, and they'll move you somewhere better. Then, when you go all the&#xa0;time, you get a table that's kind of your own.&#xa0;</p> <p>Another favourite café is <a href=\"https://www.lapalette-paris.com/\">La Palette</a>. I used to go when I&#xa0;was 16, when I moved back to Paris for my International Baccalaureate. It had famous waiters back then; there's a painting of them on the wall. When I left for university, they said: “Go to America, but you have to come back!” Parisians have a reputation for being obnoxious, but I don't find that. There's a charm about how much they love their city.</p> <p>For French food, I love <a href=\"https://restaurantlevoltaire.com/\">Le Voltaire</a>, where I&#xa0;have crab salad, followed by fish. And there's Chez l'Ami Louis, where I'll order roast chicken – sounds simple, but it's really good. More festive is <a href=\"http://laperouse.com/en/\">Lapérouse</a>, which has been open since 1766; Colette's novel <em>Chatte</em> was written at one of its tables. For something sweet I'll&#xa0;go to <a href=\"https://cedric-grolet.com/\">Cédric Grolet</a>'s pâtisserie near Place Vendôme. His apple tart is incredible. There's also a wonderful tradition of&#xa0;beauty here. People take time for themselves by&#xa0;having a regular treatment – the idea is to be consistent in how you look after your skin. I go for a facial at <a href=\"https://www.sisley-paris.com/en-GB/maison-sisley/\">Maison Sisley</a> each month and I'll often get a massage from <a href=\"https://institutlucabagnara.com/\">Luca Bagnara</a>. It's great for your circulation.&#xa0;</p> <p>Some of the best places for fashion are the vintage stores around Palais-Royal, such as Gabrielle Geppert – I've found Chanel belts, Alaïa dresses and '70s Chloé silk&#xa0;gowns. Or I go to <a href=\"https://www.24s.com/en-gb/\">Le Bon Marché</a>, Paris's main department store, because it's easy. But it also stocks <a href=\"https://www.alexandragolovanoff.com/en\">Alexandra Golovanoff</a>, who does beautiful sweaters, and jewellery by <a href=\"https://www.charlottechesnais.fr/en/\">Charlotte Chesnais</a>. I also love <a href=\"https://www.molli.com/?lang=en\">Molli</a>, which makes delicate knits from fine virgin wool.</p> <p>For interiors, I go to the flea market in Saint-Ouen. A&#xa0;lot of the pieces I've found are Italian – chairs by Paolo Buffa and my marble Mangiarotti dining table – but I also have a lot of French rattan furniture. Often I'll get furniture upholstered – <a href=\"https://simrane.com/\">Simrane</a> sells beautiful fabrics from India. And I fill my home with flowers from <a href=\"https://chauvinparis.com/?lang=en\">Eric Chauvin</a>. His arrangements are amazing and never too perfect: you see them at events for Dior, Louis Vuitton and Chanel.</p> <p>If I'm not at the market, I like to spend my weekends at the design galleries on Rue de Seine – including <a href=\"https://www.jacqueslacoste.com/en/\">Galerie Jacques Lacoste</a>, which focuses on 20th-century furniture. Further down you'll find <a href=\"https://www.galeriekreo.com/en/\">Galerie Kreo</a>, a limited-edition lighting store, and the contemporary art gallery <a href=\"https://kamelmennour.com/\">Kamel Mennour</a>. But most of all I love going to <a href=\"https://www.opera-comique.com/en\">Opéra Comique</a>, the 18th-century theatre that Bizet's <em>Carmen</em> was written for.</p> <p>I don't usually stay at hotels in Paris, but <a href=\"https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/hotel-de-crillon\">Hôtel de Crillon</a>, where we have a great Sisley spa, is exemplary. It's&#xa0;huge, full of history and it's on the Place de la Concorde. Opposite is <a href=\"https://www.jkplace.paris/\">JK Place</a>, furnished with pieces found at antique&#xa0;stores and flea markets. Another cool place is <a href=\"https://hotelparticulier.com/en/\">Hôtel&#xa0;Particulier</a> in Montmartre, Paris's smallest hotel.&#xa0;</p> <p>Paris is going through a really interesting time – the&#xa0;young have travelled a lot, and it's becoming more international. But it's kept its French roots – the love of a café, a long lunch hour and its <em>habitués</em>. All those things remain, it's just taken on some other sides too.</p><p>Source: Rosanna Dodds 2021 'How To Spend It in... Paris' FT.com 10 September.
