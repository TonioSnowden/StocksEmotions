  "text": "<p>Widening the scope of fiction, reflecting more diverse perspectives and keeping up with the zeitgeist are all excellent aims, but in the recent rush to include Bame, trans and non-binary characters, not every YA novelist has wholly avoided the charge of bandwagon-jumping. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1536213942/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1536213942&amp;linkId=da92479658234d65c2ee441c64faadbc\"><strong>All Our Hidden Gifts</strong></a> by Caroline O'Donoghue (Walker Books, £7.99) manages to present a non-binary character with subtlety and warmth. Perhaps it works so well because, being an occult-tinged mystery-romance steeped in Irish folklore, there's a lot else going on. </p> <p>The narrator, Maeve Chambers, has ruthlessly discarded her best friend Lily in order to ingratiate herself with the cool girls at their private school. In detention, Maeve is ordered to clear out an old storeroom, where she discovers a pack of tarot cards. Instantly fascinated, she begins to give readings to fellow pupils, but after one of these sessions — involving an unusual card, the Housekeeper, which doesn't feature in other sets — Lily disappears.</p> <p>O'Donoghue's intriguing story takes in myth, history, tensions between Catholic and Protestant, and race in Ireland. Helping the repentant Maeve search for the missing girl is Lily's nail-polish wearing brother Roe, formerly Rory, who is the essence of fluidity in a novel that's all about the power of liminal spaces. </p> <p>Bullying also features in Anna Goodall's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1913101312/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1913101312&amp;linkId=757ce8672265db3ce37726a4e6dd35d4\"><strong>Maggie Blue and the Dark World</strong></a> (Guppy Books, £12.99), although here the narrator is the bullied, and it's the bully, Ida, who vanishes in strange circumstances. Aimed at a slightly younger audience (there's a magnificent talking cat, Hoagy), it's nevertheless a sophisticated magical tale, awash in sinister villains and perplexing plights. Maggie's conflicted attitude to her tormentor is subtly explored; despite the girl's meanness she can't help liking her and sensing that all is not well in Ida's seemingly perfect world. In nods to other well-established fantasy works, the first creature Maggie encounters in the oppressive Dark World brings to mind Narnia's Mr Tumnus, and another wizened creature recalls Yoda. Overall, it's an effective tale, bursting with invention. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0349003572/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0349003572&amp;linkId=d8b37d9977e9cbd1d70fb008936b2cc5\"><strong>Influence</strong></a> by Sara Shepard and Lilia Buckingham (Atom, £7.99) is set in the altogether unmagical world of the social-media influencer. Mid-teen Delilah persuades her family that her burgeoning internet fame demands they all move to LA, where she quickly falls in with older influencers. Jasmine has to keep wearing similar bizarre outfits to those she had as a child star, and professionally cheerful Fiona is a bag of nerves IRL. The most famous and intimidating of them all is Scarlet, whose eager fans lap up every detail of her “ship” with gorgeous fellow influencer Jack Dono. But Delilah catches Jack's roving eye, causing the trolls to explode with rage. </p> <p>These teenagers may earn a fortune and get invited to all the best parties, but the freebies come at huge personal cost. Both Fiona and Jasmine possess real-world dimensions that wouldn't go down well with the fanbase, Scarlet and Jack are stuck pretending to like each other, and it's not even that glamorous. One of the girls is sternly told by her manager that instead of having fun with her friends, she has to go home and drink smoothies in order to provide sponsored content. Throwing in a murder mystery hardly makes this milieu feel any more tawdry. Slightly sloppy in the writing, this nevertheless scores high with its unflinching detail of a baffling modern phenomenon.</p> <p>Though located within a more mundane setting, Lisa Williamson's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1788451538/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1788451538&amp;linkId=a1656fadc728d2ce3ee85842418f8d67\"><strong>First Day of My Life</strong></a> (David Fickling, £10.99) grips from the start, as 16-year-old Jojo flees with a newborn on the very same day that a baby is stolen. The twist is, it's not the same kid. One day, hit by the most severe period pains she's ever had, Jojo finds a “jelly-like substance” in her pants. (Williamson can do unflinching detail too.) Many agonising spasms later, Jojo realises the unimaginable is happening. Eight months after a fling at a New Year's Eve party, baby Albie shoots out onto the bathroom floor. </p> <p>The ensuing saga involves Jojo, her volatile best friend Frankie, and a boy whose identity I won't reveal for spoiler purposes. Meanwhile, Jojo's mum Helen is married to her stepmum, Stacey — and they are trying for a baby. The novel dares to pose questions about maternity, biology and parenthood at a time when the nuclear family is being reconfigured. It culminates in a wild night out in Swindon during a thunderstorm, where the trio become heavily dependent on the kindness of random strangers. If some of the background characters feel merely sketched in, the central trio is well drawn, especially Frankie: headstrong, emotional, self-centred but extremely likeable for all that.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
