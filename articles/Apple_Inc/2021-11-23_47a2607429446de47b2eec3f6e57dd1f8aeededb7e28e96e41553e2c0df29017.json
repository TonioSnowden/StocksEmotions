  "text": "<p>Short sellers have thrown in the towel on Tesla, with positions as a percentage of its total tradeable shares falling to 3.3 per cent, from 19.6 per cent at the start of last year.</p> <p>Short seller Carson Block, founder of Muddy Waters Capital, says he understands the reasons people choose to bet against Tesla, arguing that “in principle, they're not wrong” about the fundamentals not supporting its trillion-dollar valuation. “But the other side is [Tesla chief executive] Elon Musk, who is better at playing the public company game than anybody I've ever seen.”</p> <p>Even with negative news over the past month — Musk promising<br>to sell 10 per cent of his stock if his Twitter followers said so, Tesla being sued for $162m by JPMorgan Chase over an alleged missed payment — the shares have still risen about 30 per cent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f8d65b3-6fe4-4bb9-9d13-2f8e7bf82d9f\">reports our markets team.</a></p> <p>In today's Big Read, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17f0cd1f-e751-4ddb-b13c-ea4e685b55c0\">Robin Wigglesworth looks at</a> the wider footprint of what might be called the “Tesla-financial complex”, which far outstrips the company's market capitalisation. This is because of a vast, tangled web of dependent investment vehicles, corporate emulators and an enormous associated derivatives market of unparalleled breadth, depth and hyperactivity. </p> <p>Combined, these factors mean that Tesla's influence over the ebb and flow of the stock market is far greater than even its size would imply. It may even be historically unrivalled in its wider impact, some analysts say.</p> <p>Powered by ordinary retail investors, the nominal trading value of Tesla options has averaged $241bn a day in recent weeks, according to Goldman Sachs. That compares with $138bn a day for Amazon, the second most active single-stock option market, and $112bn a day for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index combined. Tesla has helped push US option trading volumes above actual stock trading volumes this year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, hedge funds that have shorted Tesla shares over the past decade are sitting on cumulative losses of more than $60bn, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics company. Just this year the losses have come to $11bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Shorting Tesla is just an ego trade at this stage,” says Michael Green, &#xa0;chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1.
