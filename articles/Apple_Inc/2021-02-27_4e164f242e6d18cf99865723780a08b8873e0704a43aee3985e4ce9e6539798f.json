  "text": "<p>Before we even think about guests, these are the essential conditions of my fantasy dinner party: a warm, shirtsleeve-balmy summer evening on a candlelit terrace in the grounds of a villa on a Balearic island. From a distance, the sound of the sea. </p> <p>Under lockdown, this is what&#xa0;I&#xa0;yearn for more than anything: good company, a gentle breeze, excellent food and wine. Last summer, in that brief window, we had a barbecue with family and friends in the garden that was deliciously carefree. I'd&#xa0;like to think there will be more of those in the coming months.</p> <p>Failing that, I'll settle for the company of my five chosen guests. I should mention that I&#xa0;thought about inviting Kenneth Williams, the great comic and raconteur, but I decided against it because I feared that he would dominate proceedings and be jealous of the attention paid to the other guests, in particular <strong>William Shakespeare</strong>. </p> <p>Shakespeare is here to fill in&#xa0;the&#xa0;gaps between the handful of&#xa0;known facts about him, perhaps to provide a clue to the wellspring of his creativity (this will be a theme of the evening) and to answer a question prompted by the&#xa0;crashing of the waves: how much of him is in <em>The Tempest</em>'s Prospero? </p> <p>And I can tell you now: he looks nothing like those portraits of him.</p> <p>Seated next to him is another great English writer, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fadd0da0-372e-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\"><strong>George Orwell</strong></a>, who is here to cast a caustic&#xa0;eye over political developments and to unpick those “smelly little orthodoxies” that still infest our politics. I fill him in on the perverse uses of the word “Orwellian”, which, in the era of angry culture wars, has come to mean any attempt to moderate the way we talk to each other. Orwell is disturbed to find that the value he fundamentally equated with Englishness, decency, has been eroded. </p> <p>Although he gave hundreds of&#xa0;radio broadcasts, none of them was recorded, so his voice has been lost to history. Contrary to reports that it was whiny, I can now say that he is a fine and mellifluous speaker. </p> <p>A heavy smoker of hand-rolled cigarettes, Orwell is also here for another reason: I no longer smoke but I'm notorious for cadging the&#xa0;occasional roll-up, and tonight the conditions are perfect for one of my occasional lapses. Thanks, George.</p> <p>Drinks are served. To begin with, a bone-dry gin martini, made to the method recommended by film-maker <a href=\"https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/bfi-news/discreet-charm-perfect-martini\">Luis Buñuel</a>, in which a ray of sunshine is allowed to pass through a bottle of Noilly Prat and leave its imprint on the gin. </p> <p>Food comes from a man whose recipes I have long admired because he never stints on the things that make good food taste good: no half-fat this or low-fat that for Nigel Slater. He is stationed nearby at an open kitchen, from which he keeps up a flow of fish balls, gazpacho (ideal for a hot night), salads with quinoa, salads with mozzarella, salads with beetroot, grilled pork with courgette and sauerkraut. (Orwell, a steamed pudding man, is not so keen on all those salads.) </p> <p>To drink: Sancerre, a powerful Shiraz from Australia, a lighter Pinot Noir from Burgundy. I'm not&#xa0;a great dessert fan and will be happy to sip chilled Royal Tokaji instead.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the other guests are arriving. The blues guitarist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6f17cba-134a-11e5-ad26-00144feabdc0\"><strong>Robert Johnson</strong></a> ambles over, a guitar slung across his shoulder. He wants to talk about his trip to the crossroads, where he met the Devil — the source, it is said, of his creativity. And he'll give us a tune or two as well. </p> <p>His Delta blues should appeal to everyone at the table, including <strong>Pocahontas</strong>, who is here to tell us&#xa0;about her short but extraordinary life, which spanned two cultures totally alien from each other. It turns out that she and Shakespeare have mutual acquaintances from her time in London. </p> <p>She relates her experiences, and those of her family, of witnessing the arrival of the first European settlers at what became Jamestown: what did the Native Americans make of these strange creatures? How did they learn each other's languages? </p> <p>She, Orwell and Shakespeare also have much to say about imperialism.&#xa0;</p> <p>Finally, <strong>David Bowie</strong> rocks up. He's the quietest of the party, perhaps surprisingly (though a colleague once sat at a dinner opposite Bowie without realising for a long time who he was). </p> <p>Creativity is a fascinating subject, its sources a mystery; Dave,&#xa0;Bill and Bob (we are on friendly terms now) explore this. Then Dave and Bob give us a duet. Of all the musical genres he tackled, Bowie never really did the blues, but it follows a predictable pattern so they can improvise. There's an upright piano nearby, and they play around on that for a while.</p> <p>Back at the table, the conversation is at risk of turning too serious. But those who knew Bowie recall&#xa0;a man who could be very funny indeed, with a gift for mimicry, so tonight he lightens the mood with that infectious cackle. And maybe Bill has some dirty limericks.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
