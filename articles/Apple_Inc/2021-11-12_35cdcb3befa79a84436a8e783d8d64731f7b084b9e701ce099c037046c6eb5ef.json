  "title": "iPhone Maker Foxconn Expects Supply-Chain Issues Until Second Half of 2022; Component shortage prompts Foxconn to forecast consumer electronics sales decline in fourth quarter",
  "text": "<p>The relatively high revenue that Foxconn booked a year earlier is also a factor, it saidâ€”Foxconn's revenue was boosted in the fourth quarter last year as some smartphone launches were delayed from the usual September amid the pandemic.</p><p>\"If not for the material shortage, the outlook for the fourth quarter would in fact look better,\" said Young Liu, Foxconn's chairman, in a call on Friday.</p><p>Apple said last month that supply-chain constraints, which included the chip shortage and Covid-19 cases in the components manufacturing hub of Southeast Asia, had hurt potential revenue by $6 billion in July-September and hindered iPhone production.</p><p>Apple executives warned that the impact would likely be worse in the October-December quarter during its important holiday demand season, though they declined to forecast how long the chip shortage could last.</p><p>A bout of Covid-19 outbreaks and factory closures in Vietnam and Malaysia, which assembles chips and electronics, also exacerbated the supply-chain issue in recent months. Apple said that by October, it has made progress on Covid-19-related disruptions.</p><p>Foxconn also said Friday that some pandemic-related bottlenecks are starting to ease. It expects shipments of components including optical modules, like the ones used in smartphone cameras, to go back to normal by end of the year as the pandemic situation improves, Mr. Liu said.</p><p>Power management chips, used in battery-operated devices like smartphones, would likely remain tight, he added.</p><p>July-September profit for Taiwan-based Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., rose 20% compared with a year earlier to 36.98 billion New Taiwan dollars, equivalent to $1.33 billion. Quarterly revenue increased by 8.8%.</p><p>Pegatron Corp., another major assembler of Apple products, said this week that it expects supply-chain constraints to improve during the fourth quarter. The pandemic outbreak in Vietnam and Malaysia had also hurt the company's profit in the third quarter, it said.</p><p>Beyond Apple, other smartphone makers have struggled to secure the parts they need. Counterpoint Research in September cut its 2021 growth forecast for world-wide smartphone shipments to 6% from 12% earlier in the year, citing the chip shortage. Average wholesale phone prices are set to rise by 11% this year from a year earlier, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics.</p><p>Zhao Yueling contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com and Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com</p><p>iPhone Maker Foxconn Expects Supply-Chain Issues Until Second Half of 2022</p>",
