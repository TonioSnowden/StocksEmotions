  "text": "<p>Science and medicine furnish the best early examples of data analysis and visualisation. In the 1850s Florence Nightingale, who established the principles of modern nursing, used a chart to show causes of death in the Crimean war. She deployed her data to make a case for better sanitary standards in general. In America, W.E.B. du Bois, a civil-rights activist and scholar, was a pioneer of data communication. The first African-American to be awarded a doctorate, in 1895 he used data visualisation to show how black Americans suffered from discrimination. Today is the age of big data. Especially after the covid-19 pandemic, public interest in the topic has soared. Crunching the numbers and communicating the results of analysis are not always easy. Here are five books, one podcast and a documentary that help explain how it is done.</p><p>The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data. By David Spiegelhalter. Basic Books; 448 pages; $20. Penguin; £11.</p><p>In “The Art of Statistics” Sir David Spiegelhalter, a British statistician, demonstrates how looking at data can help to solve common problems. From hospital mortality rates to ovarian cancer screenings, many of his examples are drawn from the medical field. He also shows how other sciences, such as archaeology and engineering, have been changed by the use of statistics. A witty writer, he helps readers improve their data literacy and see the bigger picture when looking at numbers. Dealing with data, he argues, is both fun and important—he recounts how he gave evidence as a statistician to a public inquiry into failures to catch a serial killer. He might be the first person ever to plot jelly beans on a logarithmic scale.</p><p>W.E.B. Du Bois's Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America. By W.E.B. Du Bois. Princeton Architectural Press; 144 pages; $30 and £22.</p><p>The infographics created by W.E.B. Du Bois and his team at the University of Atlanta at the turn of the 20th century were nothing short of visionary. Du Bois's data visualisation still serves as an example of the power and beauty of a well-thought out chart. All of his revolutionary data designs are published together in this book. Originally his works were destined for Europe and so are described in English and French. About 60 of Du Bois's hand-drawn data visualisations were shown alongside 500 photographs at the Exposition Universelle, the Paris World Fair, in 1900. Afterwards they were stored at the Library of Congress and largely forgotten until they were digitised a century later. Du Bois's legacy in sociology, civil-rights activism and data design was thereby recharted for a new generation.</p><p>Calling Bullshit: The Art of Scepticism in a Data-Driven World. By Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West. Random House; 336 pages; $18. Allen Lane; £11.</p><p>Separating reliable from dodgy data can be tricky. Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West, both scholars at the University of Washington, teach students how to do so. “Calling Bullshit” is their guide to navigating a world full of doubtful claims based on spurious data. Have scientists really invented a “gaydar”? Do rappers die young? Are most food-stamp recipients fraudsters? Drawing on entertaining examples from science, advertising and politics, they show how numbers can be used to mislead, how machine learning really works and why a chart doesn't always serve as a proof. (Read our full review of the book from 2020.)</p><p>How Charts Lie. By Alberto Cairo. W.W. Norton; 256 pages; $17 and £13.</p><p>This book will change the way any reader looks at charts. Data can be powerful: consider how charts convey information, often transforming dull numbers into colourful takeaways. But data isn't always used beneficially. Alberto Cairo of the University of Miami shows how charts can mislead even when they present true data. Many people skim or skip over charts. Mr Cairo explains how to read them properly, to understand what a chart represents and whether a particular angle on the data may mislead. It helps to pay close attention to the “scaffolding” (sometimes called the “furniture”) on any chart, such as the title, the legend and the scale it uses. It is necessary, too, to question the intentions of whoever provided the source of the chart or data. (We reviewed this book in 2019.)</p><p>Am I Normal? By Mona Chalabi. A podcast by TED Audio Collective. On Apple Podcasts and Spotify.</p><p>In this podcast Mona Chalabi, a data editor for the Guardian, digs into data to find answers to everyday questions. Known for her characterful hand-drawn data visualisations, she manages to put numbers into perspective without losing sight of the humans behind them. From wondering how many friends are enough, to answering how long—statistically speaking—it takes to get over a break-up, she answers questions with compassion and rigorous data-driven analyses. Each episode makes the listener ask what “normal” really means. Her podcast demonstrates that working with numbers is rarely dull.</p><p>Coded Bias. Directed by Shalini Kantayya, starring Joy Buolamwini. On Netflix</p><p>No reading list on data is complete without a dive into machine learning. Applied in the right way, machine-learning techniques help to extrapolate from data and draw much broader conclusions. But with great power comes responsibility. These tools can potentially do harm as Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at MIT, explains in a documentary that was first broadcast in 2020. She shows how those working with data can hardwire racial and gender-based prejudices into code by training it on insufficient data. The film focuses on facial-recognition algorithms and how they are used to make decisions about police searches, housing and recruitment across the world. What sounds like a dystopian novel has already become reality in many instances. The documentary follows Ms Buolamwini's fight to uncover how these algorithms work and the injustice they cause.</p><p>■</p><p>For a look behind the scenes of our own data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our data newsletter.
