  "text": "<p>\n  My Marshall Major III wireless headphones have become so helpful in the studio because I'm usually a one-man recording team. If you've got a headphone wire, plus a guitar that's plugged into an amp, you'll look around and realize you're all tangled up in wires. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  I wanted to do some master recording in my home so I did my homework, and the Rupert Neve Designs Portico II Channel Microphone Preamp floored me with how great it is. I'm thinking of running my acoustic setup through it on stage, if I ever get out there again. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  My 1959 Gibson 335 never leaves my house. It's one of those special guitars. If I only had two minutes to get out of the house in a real emergency, I'd take my MacBook and that guitar. My Les Paul \"Phenix\" -- which was lost in a plane crash in 1980 and found its way back to me about 18 years ago -- is amazing, but it's for certain things. I use it a lot, obviously, but the 335 can do anything. If I were only allowed one guitar, that guitar could do it all. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  I have been at the cutting edge with Eventide audio since the '70s. I have stuff they want for their museum! They recently sent me their Rose Delay Effect Pedal before it came out, and I loved it. I made some suggestions, because it needed to have presets, so I feel like the pedal has a lot of me in it. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  I've used my 1950s Telefunken U47 microphone on every recording I've made since 1980. Every time I work with a new engineer, they want to try their own setup. And every time, when they try my mic, they say, \"Wow. What is that?\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  We all love our iPhones and iPads, but my MacBook Pro has my life in it. I'm always putting down ideas, so it's for my creative side, too. It's a studio in a box. I plug in a Universal Audio Apollo Twin Mk II mixer so that I can work on music in my bedroom. </p><p>\n  -- Edited from an interview by Jeff Slate </p><p></p>",
