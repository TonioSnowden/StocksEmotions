  "text": "<p>Nearly two years after Britain ended its membership of the EU after almost half a century, a shortage of migrant workers is causing severe disruption to fuel and food deliveries, unresolved trade issues are provoking tensions on the island of Ireland and, with a fishing war breaking out in the English Channel, the arguments over the impact of Brexit feel very much alive.</p><p>As Mr Barnier tells his side of the story in his book â€œMy Secret Brexit Diary\" and reinvents himself by making a return to domestic politics, Anne McElvoy asks him: how does he see the future of European unity? And can the parties either side of Brexit end a stand-off about the Northern Ireland protocol?</p><p>He also describes his experience working alongside Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson, his vision for France and what he hopes to achieve in his bid to be its next president.</p><p>And, after four years of tussles with Britain, would he still call himself an Anglophile?
