  "text": "<p>NatWest tripled profits last quarter even after setting aside £294m to cover an expected fine for money laundering failings.</p> <p>The Royal Bank of Scotland owner posted a third-quarter pre-tax profit of £1.1bn for the three months to the end of September, versus £355m the year before. Following the trend of sector peers, its results were boosted by the recovery of £242m it had set aside at the height of the pandemic to cover potential loan defaults.</p> <p>The economic outlook had improved but risks remained, said NatWest chief executive Alison Rose. “Although we are seeing challenges in the economy and for our customers — especially around supply chains and the cost of living — a number of key indicators remain positive; growth is good, unemployment is low and there are limited signs of default across our book.”</p> <p>NatWest this month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa703020-6d0a-4922-8923-a0cc085c2efd\">pleaded guilty</a> in a London court to failing to prevent alleged money laundering. The bank could face a £340m fine having been charged with three counts of failing to comply with anti-money laundering rules in the first attempted prosecution of a UK lender.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>One of <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong>'s biggest shareholders has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/ZYXJPcpU5UAOWsOIoNXP0Q~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjXgTaP0Q7aHR0cHM6Ly9mdC5jb20vY29udGVudC81MWI2ZGRkMy1jYmJmLTQ2YWUtYWJkZi1jMWY1YzE5NDVlMzdXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphewGAe2FKJzlFUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">dismissed activist hedge fund Third Point's proposal</a>&#xa0;to split the oil major into separate companies, saying it would be too complicated and unlikely to add value for long-term investors. Iain Pyle, a fund manager at Abrdn, said that while breaking up the company might look like an “interesting proposition” on a spreadsheet, it would be hard to do because of Shell's integrated operations.</p> <p><strong>Glencore</strong> raised its full-year profit target after a bumper quarter for its trading business. In a third quarter production report, the mining and commodities group revealed that the marketing division would exceed its long-term target range for adjusted pre-tax earnings of between $2.2bn and $3.2bn. Production guidance was left unchanged. </p> <p><strong>Computacenter</strong> said it remains on track to hit 2021 guidance after the third quarter ended marginally ahead of expectations. The IT outsourcer said that while product supply issues were affecting the timing of revenue bookings and increasing inventory levels, the shortages had not been as severe as the most pessimistic market predictions. </p> <p><strong>Plus500</strong> has pledged to stop awarding management special one-off bonuses following a protest vote at the financial markets bookmaker's annual general meeting. More than 20 per cent of votes cast rejected Plus500's resolutions related to its remuneration and&#xa0;a bonus payment tied to the company gaining a tax exemption in Israel.</p> <p>Food packer <strong>Hilton Foods</strong> revealed an agreement to buy Fairfax Meadow, a Derby-based wholesale butcher, for £23.8m and said recent trading has been in line with expectations.</p> <p><strong>Harwood Capital</strong> has abandoned plans to buy <strong>GYG</strong>, the superyacht painting and maintenance company, but pledged to remain a shareholder. “Following collaborative discussions throughout the due diligence process, the board of GYG is in agreement with Harwood's decision that now is not the appropriate time to progress a potential offer,” GYG said.</p> <p><strong>ConvaTec</strong>, the medical products maker, posted a 3.7 per cent improvement in third-quarter revenue and said full-year sales growth should be towards the upper end of previous guidance.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>Time Out</strong>, the international food hall and listings magazine group, said that CEO <strong>Julio Bruno</strong> has stepped down with immediate effect to “pursue other business interests.” His successor is Chris Ohlund, currently the group's executive vice-chair. Time Out reported a £70.5m loss for the 18 months ended June and a cash balance at the period end of £19.1m. The company said it had been encouraged by current trading in spite of the current dearth of tourists. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Apple</strong> revenues were&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46069192-7261-4959-b46d-2e30092bce8d\">slightly below forecasts</a>&#xa0;but the technology company achieved higher net profits than anticipated despite a components shortage that cost it $6bn in its latest quarter. Revenue hit $83.4bn in its fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, up 29 per cent from a year ago but missing expectations of $84.3bn.</p> <p><strong>Amazon</strong> said that&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ff4f9f3-7e55-4ac4-a000-c04294a0c338\">severe staffing shortages</a>&#xa0;and mounting costs would throttle its earnings for the rest of the year. The turmoil took its toll in the July-September period, with Wall Street left disappointed as Amazon delivered the slowest year-on-year rate of growth since 2015, with total revenues up 15 per cent to $110.8bn.</p> <p><strong>Facebook</strong> is changing its name to Meta. The <a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-b20fd8ea-2dda-45ad-aa15-1ed7a7e5e46f/aKKs3FvLgNAf6U0cGVE6zg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjXgTaP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvYjIwZmQ4ZWEtMmRkYS00NWFkLWFhMTUtMWVkN2E3ZTVlNDZmP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjE3Yjc0MThmNmVlYmIwMDA0YWIzYTZjJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphewGAe2FKJzlFUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">corporate rebranding</a> reflects the company's push to build a digital avatar-filled virtual world known as the metaverse as it battles a deepening public relations crisis and growing regulatory scrutiny surrounding its Facebook and Instagram apps.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Britain's biggest mortgage lender has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4965d921-8276-4a4a-a689-e0c426e79bb4\">long been a proxy</a> for its economy, writes <strong>Cat Rutter Pooley</strong>, who draws parallels between Lloyds Banking Group's quarterly results and the Budget delivered by chancellor Rishi Sunak the day before. A brighter economic outlook means lower than expected losses on loans and lower impairments, which leaves plenty of potential for further capital releases, she says.</p> <p><strong>Tim Harford</strong> takes on the question of how to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d666b9a8-f2a9-4a51-9c85-fb4223c556b0\">tax carbon emissions</a>, proposing that the best solution is the simplest. A “surprisingly subtle” carbon tax linked to the cost of production makes climate impact as real a cost as any other, he writes. “It sends a signal along all those supply chains, nudging every decision towards the lower-carbon alternative.”</p> <p><strong>John Gapper</strong> calls on us to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/466085b5-0eef-4c42-b2de-f0c41db8c470\">reject the commercialisation</a> of Halloween and remember its true meaning as a celebration of zombies.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'NatWest profits surge despite money laundering charge' FT.com 29 October.
