  "text": "<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a speech to Luxembourg's Parliament on Thursday, said that Russia controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory and that the front line stretches for more than 600 miles.</p><p>The town of Pokrovsk, 80 miles southwest of Severodonetsk, has become a temporary refuge for hundreds of people who each day are fleeing areas increasingly being shelled by Russian forces looking to expand their offensive in Donbas.</p><p>A free train service to Dnipro, capital of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region to the west, leaves Pokrovsk every afternoon filled with jittery passengers who often choose to leave their homes only when they find themselves in the firing line.</p><p>\"We waited until the bitter end, but we couldn't stay any longer,\" said Yevheny Filipski, 41, who drove out of Avdiivka, an industrial town under relentless bombardment on the border with the pro-Russian breakaway Donetsk People's Republic, with his wife, Yulia. \"There are dead bodies on the streets, and everything is on fire. It's like a living hell,\" he said.</p><p>Yuriy Chizh left his town of Berestove, 15 miles from Lysychansk, a city across the Siverskyi Donets river from Severodonetsk that Russia is seeking to encircle. He said there had been no gas for the past six days, and the police and local officials had all left, leaving a regiment of Ukrainian soldiers to guard the town.</p><p>Mr. Chizh, 75, said his two daughters and two grandchildren had previously headed to Poland and Lithuania. He finally decided to leave himself when a shell hit a neighboring house on Tuesday. But his partner chose to remain to care for elderly relatives who were too frail to leave.</p><p>\"We had a farm and lived well, with apple and pear trees and a huge garden to tend,\" he said. \"But I knew we'd be next on the front line.\" </p><p>Yuriy Chizh, who caught a train out of Pokrovsk on Thursday, said he decided to leave his town of Berestove after a shell hit a neighboring house earlier this week.

PHOTO: Serhii Korovayny for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>After leaving front-line towns, many of those displaced pass through a local church near the railway station in Pokrovsk, which offers shelter, food and clothing. Yehor Olikin, a volunteer at the church, said about 250 people used to come each day, but numbers in recent days have fallen to a few dozen because towns like Avdiivka, Lysychansk and Lyman are too dangerous to reach for activists who drive to evacuate residents.</p><p>Severodonetsk has been a focus of intense fighting, as Russia concentrated its war effort on trying to conquer the remainder of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The city's prewar population of around 100,000 has mostly fled to escape the heavy shelling by Russian forces, which local officials say has destroyed much of Severodonetsk's housing.</p><p>Under cover of near-constant artillery fire, Russian troops are advancing on Ukrainian defenders in the city, pushing them back to the Siverskyi Donets river, beyond which lies the town of Lysychansk, already under heavy bombardment.</p><p>Russia's advance has been slow despite its quantitative advantage in artillery and munitions.</p><p>Ukraine's toll of dead and injured soldiers has led Kyiv to appeal to its Western supporters for long-range weapons that would allow it to hit back at Russia's artillery. The U.S. has promised to send Ukraine guided rocket systems to boost the defenders' firepower.</p><p>Ukraine's struggle to halt the Russian offensive in Donbas is exposing differences among countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that are sending Kyiv military and other aid.</p><p>Germany and France, which have sent limited heavy weapons so far, are skeptical about whether Ukraine can realistically drive the invading Russian army back to its positions when the war began on Feb. 24. Berlin and Paris are particularly anxious to avoid an accidental escalation into a direct clash with Russia, and have called for a cease-fire and a negotiated end to a war that is adding to economic strains in Europe and world-wide.</p><p>Poland and other eastern NATO members see a greater threat to their security if Russia ends up controlling swaths of Ukraine. They fear that even a partial Russian success in Ukraine would encourage further imperialist expansionism by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>President Biden has vowed to continue arming Ukraine so that it can achieve the strongest possible position on the battlefield before negotiating a settlement to end the war.</p><p>Washington hasn't said whether that corresponds to Mr. Zelensky's declared aim of having a cease-fire only when Ukraine has fought its way back to prewar positions.</p><p>Russia's war on Ukraine has uprooted millions of Ukrainians.</p><p>\"Around 12 million of our citizens have been forced to leave their homes because of the war. More than five million went abroad. And the vast majority of them are women and children,\" Mr. Zelensky said in a late night video address on Wednesday. \"We'll do everything so that they can return home, to Ukraine.\"</p><p>Russia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday that 18,886 people had been relocated from areas of fighting in Ukraine to the territory of Russia in the previous 24 hours, including 2,663 children. It said residents of the Donbas and areas occupied by Russia had been provided with 428 tons of humanitarian aid in the same period.</p><p>Ukraine has denounced what it says are forced evacuations of Ukrainians to Russia, though some Ukrainians with relatives in Russia have chosen to flee there instead of to parts of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv.</p><p>In the Lviv region, the final destination of the evacuation trains, Gov. Maksym Kozytskiy said Thursday that five people were injured after Russian warships on the Black Sea fired rockets at rail infrastructure. He said trains had been delayed and repairs were under way on the railroads.</p><p>Ukrainian officials said Russian artillery struck two villages near the front line in the southern Kherson region, where a counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces is aiming to break through Russian lines and recapture territory taken early in the invasion.</p><p>The Ukrainian counteroffensive has caused Russian troops to scramble to secure their communication lines in the south and could force Russia to deploy more resources in the region, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, which releases daily analyses of the fighting.</p><p>Russia's focus on capturing Severodonetsk, and its concentration of forces around that area, have prompted some pro-Kremlin bloggers in Russia to criticize the approach and argue that the military is leaving itself exposed in other parts of Ukraine that it occupies, especially in the country's south.</p><p>\"The enemy will likely continue to target weak areas in the Russian army's defense around Kherson and Zaporizhzhia,\" Igor Girkin, a former intelligence officer who led pro-Russian militants in a separatist movement in eastern Ukraine in 2014 under the nom de guerre of Igor Strelkov, wrote on Telegram.</p><p>Write to Matthew Luxmoore at Matthew.Luxmoore@wsj.com and Marcus Walker at marcus.walker@wsj.com</p><p>Thousands Flee Front-Line Towns in Ukraine as Russian Forces Advance</p>",
