  "text": "<p><strong>Next</strong> has bumped up its profit guidance — again. The retailer has form on this front, increasing estimates three times already this year and three times last year. </p> <p>Pre-tax profits for the six months to July were up 5.9 per cent on the equivalent pre-pandemic period, the high street retailer said. Full price sales in the past eight weeks were 20 per cent higher than the same period in 2019, it said. </p> <p>For the second half of its financial year, which runs until the end of January, it had previously forecast a rise of 6 per cent in full price sales. Now, Next reckons it will be up to 10 per cent, with full-year pre-tax profits of up to £800m. That is 6.9 per cent higher than 2019 and £36m above the company's previous guidance. </p> <p>Worrywart Simon Wolfson still finds reasons for concern: “it is almost certain that underlying conditions are not as good as they currently appear”, the company cautions. But for a group that errs on the side of pessimism, the following statement is telling. “ . . . The longer-term outlook for Next appears to be more positive than it has been for many years”, Next says.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>The <strong>UK government</strong> is closing in on a deal to force <strong>China's CGN</strong> to give up a 20 per cent stake in a <strong>new nuclear plant</strong>. A minority stake in the £20bn Sizewell B plant will be sold to institutional investors or floated on the stock market under the plans. Our correspondents Jim Pickard and Nathalie Thomas <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a92bad50-ba5a-44e5-883b-29fac8a4571e\">bring you the full details</a> of the latest efforts to limit Chinese involvement in critical UK infrastructure.</p> <p>Next might be back to pre-pandemic normal, but that is still far from the case at travel retailer <strong>SSP</strong>. Revenues in its fourth quarter, which ends tomorrow, are expected to be just under half of 2019 levels. It is planning for a “slightly slower” recovery in sales for the next financial year than before. </p> <p><strong>Abrdn</strong>, the asset manager previously known as Standard Life Aberdeen, has sold a £268m stake in Indian investment group HDFC Asset Management. Abrdn said it plans to use the proceeds for “general corporate purposes”. </p> <p>Broker <strong>Peel Hunt </strong>starts trading today on Aim after launching a float to capitalise on the boom in corporate dealmaking and IPOs post-pandemic. It secured a £280m valuation, raising £40m in new capital and £72m for selling shareholders. </p> <p>And finally the <strong>FCA</strong> has set out more details of the transition from <strong>Libor</strong>. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Amazon </strong>wants even more access to your home. The big tech company has unveiled an autonomous robot designed to patrol your hallways, as part of a suite of new tech products that could alarm digital privacy advocates. One analyst at a digital civil liberties group said: “If somebody has always wanted an iPad on wheels that can roll around your house, this device might be of interest to them”. Amazon said the robot, named Astro, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38dd0742-c4af-4c0d-b0b2-6afc844c63d9\">was a “beautiful illustration”</a> of advancements in artificial intelligence.</p> <p><strong>Sanofi</strong> has stopped development of its Covid-19 vaccine based on messenger RNA technology despite positive results in early-stage trials. The French pharmaceutical group acknowledged that it was too late to be useful when rivals BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna have captured the market, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22ec6b9f-d007-41a9-8ab9-a76d17c73a3f?emailId=6153e1c6f34a7e00042b602c&amp;segmentId=22011ee7-896a-8c4c-22a0-7603348b7f22\">Leila Abboud reports</a>. </p> <p>And in the latest <strong>Evergrande </strong>news, the developer has raised Rmb10bn ($1.5bn) by selling part of its stake in a bank to a state-owned investment group as it faces mounting pressure over bond repayment deadlines. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/802e9d29-9ae4-441a-871c-edb8277dc7e2\">Thomas Hale and Edward White</a> have the full details of the latest twist in the Evergrande tale.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Back to the office seems to mean back to the bar, observes <strong>Brooke Masters</strong>. But critically for drinks makers, does it mean back to the booze? Anticipating the problem of an increasingly abstemious youth, drinks companies have poured investment into premium and low alcohol products. Trying the non-alcoholic tipples, our chief business columnist isn't entirely won over. But, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40231954-adbc-4b6b-bfe5-5ec3da397c39\">she ponders, maybe she is just old</a>. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Upbeat Next says outlook better than ‘for many years'' FT.com 29 September.
