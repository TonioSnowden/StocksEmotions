  "title": "Swatch, Omega Maker Sees Boost From MoonSwatch Watch Partnership; Swatch Group says demand for new line shows shoppers still have appetite for affordable models",
  "text": "<p>The MoonSwatch became an internet sensation when it hit stores in March. Lines snaked out of Swatch stores around the globe, and stocks quickly sold out. Swatch said it hasn't been able to meet demand. MoonSwatches being sold on third-party sites online are fetching prices two or three times the suggested retail price.</p><p>The launch was a much-needed success for the Swatch brand, whose sales have been dwindling for years, analysts said.</p><p>The Apple watch and other smartwatches have decimated entry-level watch sales over the past decade. While Swiss watchmakers achieved record revenues in 2021 by selling more luxury watches, the collapse in sales of affordable models continued.</p><p>Known for its colorful straps and quirky designs, the Swatch brand has lost appeal among younger consumers, who typically want devices with connectivity and other functions, said Oliver Müller, founder of Switzerland-based consultancy LuxeConsult.</p><p>Sales of Swatch brand watches have declined from over 20 million watches a year at their peak to around 3 million last year, according to estimates from LuxeConsult.</p><p>Swatch doesn't disclose sales figures for its individual brands, which also include luxury watchmakers Blancpain, Breguet, Longines and Omega.</p><p>A spokesman for the company said demand for the new MoonSwatch demonstrates that affordable watches and the Swatch brand are still attractive to consumers.</p><p>Swatch didn't reveal how many MoonSwatches it has sold. Sales of the model might have reached roughly 150,000, LuxeConsult's Mr. Müller estimated, contributing relatively little to the group's bottom line compared with its luxury models.</p><p>While MoonSwatch has proved a big hit, its success doesn't necessarily mean the Swatch brand has begun to arrest its long-term decline, Mr. Müller said, with some consumers likely viewing the product as an affordable Omega rather than a desirable Swatch.</p><p>Overall, Swatch said group revenues for the first six months of the year rose 7.4% to 3.61 billion Swiss francs, equivalent to $3.67 billion, compared with the same period last year. Profit increased 18.5% to 320 million francs.</p><p>The company said its sales grew by double-digit percentages in all of its major global markets except for China, where Covid lockdowns closed retail stores and disrupted deliveries from central warehouses.</p><p>Swatch, Omega Maker Sees Boost From MoonSwatch Watch Partnership</p>",
