  "text": "<p>John Lee, Hong Kong's second-highest ranking official, has joined the race to succeed Carrie Lam as the Chinese territory's leader, signalling Beijing's increasing focus on security after pro-democracy protests rocked the city in 2019.</p> <p>Lee, a 64-year-old former security minister, resigned from his post as the top civil servant on Wednesday and is believed to have Beijing's backing, according to people familiar with the process. </p> <p>The former police officer would be the first chief executive with a security background since the city's handover from the UK to China in 1997 and has played a significant role in a crackdown on opposition following Beijing's imposition of a sweeping national security law in 2020. </p> <p>Almost 200 activists have been arrested and multiple independent media outlets have closed, including the best-selling pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily. More than 10,000 have been arrested since the 2019 protests.</p> <p>“He is the only candidate,” Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing politician who sits on the election committee which selects the new leader, told the Financial Times.</p> <p>“Beijing wants to stop any future riots,” said another election committee member.</p> <p>Membership is restricted to about 1,500 “patriots only” Beijing loyalists, who are expected to cast their votes on May 8.</p> <p>Lee has previously said that the Chinese government's counter-terrorism measures policies in Xinjiang, where Beijing has interned 1mn Muslim minorities, were “worth studying”.</p> <p>But critics have pointed out that he lacks experience handling financial and economic affairs in a city whose reputation as an international business hub has been battered by the security law and some of the most restrictive Covid-19 policies in the world. </p> <p>“Many people have raised the fact but as a leader, he will surely have a team to work with him,” said one senior business executive.</p> <p>Lam, who announced on Monday that she would not seek a second term, oversaw <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79bd3e9b-74cf-4f3f-8cff-d940d16021a7\">the government's disastrous handling of an Omicron outbreak </a>that led to the city's death rate rise to the highest in the world in March. </p> <p>Hong Kong has been virtually sealed off from the rest of the world as officials followed Beijing's zero-Covid strategy. That isolation, plus mixed messaging on whether the city would go into lockdown and positive cases would be forced into compulsory government quarantine, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f77c5717-cb9a-4a0d-a2d3-5761592ba80a\">sparked an exodus of residents</a>. </p> <p>A number of cases where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63be4a74-f080-49c9-bcbf-c1680e34a391\">children with Covid were separated from their parents in hospitals</a> further spooked the city's international community.</p> <p>“Having been in the government for over 40 years, to serve the people of Hong Kong, is a glory,” Lee said. </p> <p>Paul Chan, the city's financial secretary who was seen as an alternative candidate, said: “I wish [Lee] every success.”</p><p>Source: Primrose Riordan and Chan Ho-him in Hong Kong 2022 'Hong Kong hardliner joins race to become city's next leader' FT.com 6 April.
