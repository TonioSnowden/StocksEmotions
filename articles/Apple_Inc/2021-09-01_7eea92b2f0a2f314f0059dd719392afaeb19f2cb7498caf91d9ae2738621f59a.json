  "text": "<p>Spotify and other technology companies for years have said Apple's restrictions were unfair and anticompetitive. The Cupertino, Calif., company previously prohibited Spotify and others from directing their users to sign-up options outside the App Store.</p><p>Apple revealed the change Wednesday, saying it was among adjustments made to close an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission and will apply globally to so-called reader apps available through Apple's App Store.</p><p>The changes go into effect early next year, Apple said, as governments have questioned the power the company holds over third-party software developers that distribute their digital goods and services through the iPhone and iPad tablet.</p><p>A U.S. judge is weighing an antitrust case&#xa0;brought by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games Inc. It claims that Apple was improperly limiting distribution of apps through its App Store and requiring payments to be conducted through its in-app payment system, which takes a cut as large as 30%. Apple has argued that its in-app payment system protects users. The latest changes wouldn't apply to Epic's case.</p><p>Rather, they are targeted at apps providing purchased or subscription content for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music and video. “Because developers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and services for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let developers of these apps share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their account,” Apple said in a statement posted on its website.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>States that cut unemployment benefits saw limited impact on job growth.</p><p>Ben Dugan works for CVS.
