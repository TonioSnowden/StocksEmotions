  "text": "<p>Social media is awash with a new philosophy: quiet quitting.</p> <p>The term is slightly misleading, since it doesn't actually mean a person leaves their job. Similar to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1270ee18-3ee0-4939-98a8-c4f40940e644\">#antiwork phenomenon</a> popularised on Reddit and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d330e276-cf9d-457f-b922-93f01186804c\">the “slow work” movement</a> Sophia covered back in June, to “quietly quit” is to simply do one's work without going that extra mile.</p> <p>It might seem like negative attitudes are to blame. But reading between the lines, there is a positive element: workers <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/21/quiet-quitting-what-to-know/\">pushing back against unrealistic workloads</a> and reclaiming their spare time for other things, such as hobbies and being with friends and family.</p> <p>This backlash to overwork is unsurprising: many are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/06/quiet-quitting-why-doing-the-bare-minimum-at-work-has-gone-global\">burnt out following the brutal effects of the pandemic</a>; the labour market remains tight, so power still lies with workers; and workload is still the white elephant in the room as companies remain reluctant to tackle structural issues.</p> <p>Will quiet quitting endure amid economic pressure? For now, the labour market continues to favour workers. As the cost of living crisis intensifies, however, market dynamics could shift — especially as lay-offs begin to affect some industries and concern grows of a possible recession.</p> <p>Only time will tell if this is a fundamental change among workers globally, or just a temporary blip. </p> <p>Read on for Sophia's investigation into how to make tedious tasks more fun, and our latest podcast episode on introverts in the workplace. <em>(Janina Conboye)</em></p> <p><em>Have you noticed a difference in your own work? Are you more likely to do the bare minimum and set boundaries, or do you go the extra mile to pick up extra work? Let us know in </em><a href=\"https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times/do-you-usually-go-the-extra-mile-or-do-t\"><em><strong>this week's poll</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>The scientific argument for making work more playful</h1> <p>Even as a pretty organised, productive person, I have tasks that languish at the bottom of my to-do list. I grumbled about this recently to my boyfriend. “Treat it as a side quest,” he suggested, referring to a term popular in role-playing games that gives players rewards for completing tasks unrelated to the main story. As if by magic, thinking of the tasks I had put off as part of a game suddenly motivated me to engage with them.</p> <p>To better understand why this worked so well for me — and how it might work for others — I spoke with Sahar Yousef, a cognitive neuroscientist who studies how to improve productivity and performance at UC Berkeley's “Becoming Superhuman” lab. Lots of research in recent years has found that playing video games <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02127/full\">benefits cognitive skills</a> and that gamification of work — that is, applying aspects of a game like points, rules, competition, or simply calling something a “side quest” — <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612316301005#bb0295\">makes a task more engaging</a> and enjoyable.</p> <p>Sahar says this all comes down to dopamine, which is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032992/\">responsible for both pleasure and motivation</a>. “It's a compass,” says Sahar, that incentivises us to seek rewards.</p> <p>The “side quest” mindset — or an app like <a href=\"https://habitica.com/static/home\">Habitica</a>, which transforms your tasks into a full-blown role-playing game — will activate dopamine production particularly if your brain remembers having fun with similar games in the past.</p> <p>Even if you're not a gamer, it's still possible to kick-start motivation in your brain by “gamifying” your work. Sahar recommends what she calls a Focus sprint — that stands for find and schedule an hour, outline your tasks, cut out distractions, use a timer, and stop when your time is up. “Be intentional. Romanticise it for yourself. Give yourself a time limit. Celebrate like crazy when you finish. All of this helps to gamify your tasks,” says Sahar.</p> <p>If you've been putting off a big project, break it down into manageable chunks. This facilitates dopamine-fuelled motivation because your brain can more easily anticipate completing a specific step. If you have a lot of smaller, less urgent tasks, collect them all together until you have an hour's worth of work — and your brain can “see” the cumulative amount of dopamine. For small tasks, “the promise of dopamine is so little compared to the annoyance of doing it,” says Sahar, but when you batch them, you meet the dopamine threshold your brain requires to motivate itself.</p> <p>The act of collecting tasks can itself be rewarding; collecting is one of the “<a href=\"https://www.nifplay.org/what-is-play/play-personalities/\">play personalities</a>” that Stuart Brown outlines in his 2009 book <em>Play</em>. As you consider how to make your own work more fun, think about which play personalities resonate with you.</p> <p>Whether it's competitive or collaborative, sociability is another hugely important component of games. Simply being on a Zoom call and working quietly in the “presence” of a friend or co-worker can help you stay engaged with the task at hand. You can further gamify this by challenging yourselves not to speak until the end, and then using the last five minutes to share updates with each other about what you were able to get done.</p> <p>No matter what tactics you use, Sahar says that with enough positive reinforcement, “you get yourself addicted to your own task management and productivity”. <em>(Sophia Smith)</em></p> <h1>Listen in: Introverts in the workplace</h1> <p>This week on the Working It podcast <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/gPBKEPVr\">we are talking (quietly) about introverts at work</a>. The power of people who are more reserved in the workplace is starting to be not only understood, but appreciated. </p> <p>I talk to Morra Aarons-Mele, author of <em>Hiding in the Bathroom</em> and host of the Anxious Achiever podcast, about her experiences as an introvert entrepreneur. Morra gives the introverts among us some tips for thriving in our careers. Then I talk to Kesewa Hennessy, FT's head of audience diversity, about her <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8ceffe7-cc89-4d95-975e-6142924a33b8\">experiences as an introvert at work</a> — and she offers her tips for managers. For further reading, Kesewa cites the game-changing and ongoing impact of Susan Cain's 2012 book <em>Quiet</em>. Time for a re-read. </p> <p>Next week, Taylor Nicole Rogers will host an episode about the booming popularity of unions as cost of living crises mount. You'll also hear from guests Mick Lynch, of the UK's National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, and FT technology correspondent Dave Lee. <em>(Isabel Berwick) </em></p> <h1>Elsewhere in the world of work: </h1> <ol>  <li><p><strong>Why employers are sending staff on nature retreats: </strong>From sleeping in the woods to hugging trees, “experiential learning” is an increasingly popular way for businesses to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e03cc4bb-2415-45fa-9f50-1a413ea76a6e\">connect their workers to environmental values</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Thursdays are the new Fridays: </strong>Even if you don't work a four-day workweek, the numbers — in office attendance, public transit and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7166c0e1-c276-476f-a016-79298d2e4408\">at the pubs — seem to suggest an overall cultural shift</a> towards one.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>The uneven repercussions of sexual harassment: </strong>New research on incidents of sexual harassment at work show that it's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e142791a-8ef4-4f1c-9ac8-3106371ca60e\">not always the perpetrators who pay the highest price</a>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Apple employees push back on return-to-office order:</strong> Apple workers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e40ba5a2-9dbd-4f88-87f1-c92e412ac132\">circulated an internal petition</a> over the weekend in protest of CEO Tim Cook's mandate to be in person three days a week starting next month.

While we've reaped the productivity benefits of typing, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/087082a8-91c1-447b-a08f-4428992b0819\">memory retention and ability to learn have suffered</a>. From nostalgia and fountain pen recommendations to tech evangelists shunning tradition, FT readers had many thoughts to share on handwriting.</p> <p><strong>Hugo Brown</strong> recalls less than pleasant experiences learning penmanship in school, but more recently has discovered a therapeutic use for writing by hand:</p> <blockquote>  <p>I had some mental health problems and used “Morning Pages” to get myself started before the day's work, which was great therapy. Take three sheets of paper and start writing anything or everything that comes into your head. Stop when you get to the bottom of the third page. I can heartily recommend it as a healthy practice and to keep your hand (writing) in.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>LydTap</strong> discovered the profound muscle memory that ignites in our brains when we pick up a pen:</p> <blockquote>  <p>I couldn't remember how to spell a word until I eventually decided to write it out . . . This reinforced to me the importance of learning handwriting. It no doubt develops the same important cross-neuron connections as painting or learning a new language, the degeneration of which are associated with dementia. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Silent Man </strong>argues that, while journaling can be helpful for some personal exercises, he found it more trouble than it was worth in a professional context:</p> <blockquote>  <p>I was a fan of taking notes by hand at the beginning of my career and had an efficient system. However, after some time the number of notebooks and the annoyance of trying to pinpoint old meeting notes pushed me to online note taking. Everything is much more seamless . . . It also allows me to organise and prioritise my day much more effectively.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Responses have been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p>Source: Sophia Smith and Janina Conboye 2022 'Trick your brain to see work as play' FT.com 24 August.
