  "title": "Swift Sets New Mark for Vinyl Sales  ----  By Anne Steele",
  "text": "<p>   Taylor Swift's new album marked her biggest debut, a feat in the streaming era as fans listened online and purchased a record amount of vinyl. </p><p>   \"Midnights\" sold 1.58 million copies across formats, according to Luminate Data, formerly Nielsen Music, delivering it to the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart with the biggest sales week of the year-- and the biggest sales week since Adele's \"25\" seven years ago. </p><p>   Selling albums in the first week of a release used to be the key metric of success for an artist when coming out with new work. First-week sales figures have deteriorated in recent years as customers overwhelmingly shifted away from purchasing CDs and albums on iTunes to streaming them on services like Spotify and Apple Music. </p><p>   Ms. Swift is the only artist to sell at least a million copies in a single week for five different albums. With \"Midnights\" she notched the third-largest streaming week ever for an album. It's the biggest sales week for a vinyl album in the modern era, since Luminate began tracking music sales in 1991, moving 575,000 vinyl LPs. </p><p>   Aside from being a musical hit, the blockbuster week for \"Midnights\" is the result of a carefully orchestrated release by Ms. Swift who rallied her fans through streaming services, social media and souvenir physical album copies. Ms. Swift is the mastermind of her marketing strategy and has been involved in her business dealings more than most artists, label and industry executives say. </p><p>   \"Taylor is one of the only artists capable of delivering the music and creative needed to execute at this level,\" said Jim Roppo, co-president of Republic Records, Ms. Swift's label. </p><p>   Ms. Swift, who famously held back previous albums from streaming services, has now fully embraced the medium while also continuing to hawk myriad physical copies. With \"Midnights,\" Ms. Swift became the first artist to hit the million mark with an album that was made available on streaming at release. Adele holds the first-week record for selling 3.38 million copies of \"25,\" which she accomplished by holding it back from streaming. </p><p>   In contrast to Ms. Swift's pair of surprise releases during the pandemic, \"Midnights\" serves as a sort of case study in promoting a modern pop album -- using every tool, traditional and new, in the kit. </p><p>   \"She really in this case used new tactics to achieve older benchmarks of success,\" said Nathan Hubbard, chief executive of artist partnership company Firebird Music Holdings, calling her the best CEO in music today. </p><p>   The album is available to purchase on her website as a digital album, a CD with four editions in different colors, as a vinyl LP with four editions in different colors -- a $49 mechanism helps buyers of all four versions construct them into a clock. </p><p></p>",
