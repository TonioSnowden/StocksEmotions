  "text": "<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken sold hundreds of shares each of Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and Oracle, and 3,700 shares of Ally Financial Inc., along with his 33% share of the consulting firm WestExec Advisers LLC. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin unloaded around 30,000 shares of Tenet Healthcare Corp., where he was a board member, valued between $1 million and $5 million; disclosure documents use a range for investment estimates.</p><p>A State Dept. spokesperson said Mr. Blinken completed the divestitures but wouldn't comment on personal financial plans. The Defense Department didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>NAACP PRESIDENT Derrick Johnson told the Journal's Eliza Collins that he was \"absolutely open to\" a proposal being pushed by GOP Sen. Tim Scott during policing legislation negotiations, even as Democrats haven't committed to it. Democrats and activists want to change the doctrine known as qualified immunity, which shields police officers from lawsuits and limits civilians' ability to claim damages for constitutional rights violations. But Mr. Scott, the key GOP negotiator, says that's a nonstarter. He instead proposed making it easier to sue police departments, but not individual officers, for rights violations.</p><p>Mr. Johnson said the NAACP wants to change police departments' culture. If they become vulnerable to legal action, it could force leadership to focus more on officers' conduct. \"What can come out of here is creating a new federal floor and with that floor it could determine how agencies train, recruit and retain and oversee the culture,\" Mr. Johnson said about Mr. Scott's proposal, before cautioning that he wanted to see a final draft before making a final decision.</p><p>FOREIGN GIFTS to American universities could get more scrutiny if Congress successfully passes bipartisan China competition legislation. The legislation, known as the Endless Frontier Act, requires universities to disclose large gifts and contracts from foreign sources, with the goal of blunting \"China's malign political influence and predatory economic practices.\"</p><p>Beijing has denied attempting any systematic effort to steal U.S. research. The Senate moved the bill closer to passage with an 86-11 procedural vote Tuesday. The provision inches toward codifying a crackdown pursued by President Trump's Education Department.</p><p>MINOR MEMOS: Former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill finds cause of her spotty internet: a bee colony and 70 pounds of honey blocking cables . . . . \"My teenage son's room gives your facility a run for its money,\" Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi told the CEO of Emergent Biosolutions, which ruined 15 million vaccine doses . . . . President Biden shows off \"car guy\" bona fides in Michigan: \"I've been in my bathing suit in my driveway and not only washed my 1967 Corvette but also Simonized it.\"</p>",
