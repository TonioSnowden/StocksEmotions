  "text": "<p><strong>Grammy Award-winning Eric Whitacre, 51, is one of the world's most performed living composers. He set up the first virtual choir in 2009; by 2020, VC6 had more than 17,500 members from 129 countries. With the Eric Whitacre Singers, his albums include </strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2hnquPCPDsr3Srk64rdeVS?si=jXoR2Pk3SyK3g8ljdNTwRg\"><em><strong>Light &amp; Gold</strong></em></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2WXdu00K6aWdPG1EzLvfnC?si=WTc7qsHaQaWBDJJYecDHdw\"><em><strong>Water Night</strong></em></a><strong>. </strong></p> <p><strong>What was your childhood or earliest ambition? </strong><br>Something else every second week: a baseball player, an astronomer, an astrophysicist, a computer programmer. Music has always been part of me. I could always play by ear. It was computers that led me to computer music — Kraftwerk, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e9a44d2-7893-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab\">Jean-Michel Jarre</a>, Tangerine Dream. Synthesisers and drum machines were my whole world. I'm also a film nut. </p> <p><strong>Private school or state school? University or straight into work? </strong><br>Local public [state] schools in Nevada. At 18, I went to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. At university, I had an open mind, I loved lots of things — I was seduced by singing in the choir and that was it. </p> <p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor? </strong><br>David Weiller. He's the man who seduced me into singing in the choir, I wrote my first composition for him and he got me into conducting. So much of the man that I aspire to be is based on principles I learned from David. </p> <p><strong>How physically fit are you? </strong><br>I regularly go to the gym. I live in LA so we're outside all the time. My wife and I surf together, we're always on our bicycles. It's a super-important part of my life and I can see its dramatic impact on my brain. </p> <p><strong>Ambition or talent: which matters more to success?</strong> <br>Can luck be in there too? I look back and think how lucky I was,&#xa0;in huge and small ways. I was born&#xa0;at the right time: the internet and social media fit me like a glove. </p> <p><strong>How politically committed are you? </strong><br>Pretty profoundly. In my heart I think I am a socialist, which is&#xa0;a&#xa0;very dirty word here in&#xa0;America. I feel incredibly strongly&#xa0;about basic services — education, healthcare. My wife is&#xa0;from Belgium so I've had the&#xa0;chance to see first-hand another way of doing things, and&#xa0;I'm a fan. </p> <p><strong>What would you like to own that you don't currently possess? </strong><br>People often say, “If only I had a better violin,” and I think, “You just need to practise more.”&#xa0;But I know I would be an exponentially better cook if I had a&#xa0;really, really good spatula. </p> <p><strong>What's your biggest extravagance? </strong><br>Long baths — proper baths with salts and candles and music. </p> <p><strong>In what place are you happiest? </strong><br>A combination of being in nature and being with my family. </p> <p><strong>What ambitions do you still have? </strong><br>To write a book. Lately, I've been writing longer and longer pieces, and maybe I've got the fortitude and perseverance. I know my creative process — I'm hyper-meticulous. I can spend a day on a single line of music. </p> <p><strong>What drives you on? </strong><br>A deadline. And insatiable curiosity. </p> <p><strong>What is the greatest achievement of your life so far? </strong><br>I seem to have awakened a love of singing in a fair number of people. Maybe that's the lasting thing. </p> <p><strong>What do you find most irritating in other people?</strong><br>Negativity. I find it worse than irritating. </p> <p><strong>If your 20-year-old self could see you now, what would he think? </strong><br>He would be incredibly judgmental, for all sorts of reasons: that I'm settled, that I have a mortgage, that I'm more polished and less raw. But 20-year-old me was an idiot; 50-year-old me lives in the real world. </p> <p><strong>Which object that you've lost do you wish you still had? </strong><br>When I was 12, I collected old baseball cards and I swapped a 1954 Topps Hank Aaron for a 1955 Topps Hank Aaron. A rookie card — the first one — is a really big deal. I still regret that! When my son was&#xa0;six, he drew me a picture I&#xa0;scanned and still use in talks to show the child's mind and creative thinking. I would give anything to get the original back. </p> <p><strong>What is the greatest challenge of our time?</strong><br>Climate change. There is a profound failure of leadership. </p> <p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife? </strong><br>This is a three-martini question. I'm not a religious person. But I suspect there are certain phenomena that I don't know about, probably can't even comprehend. I'm kind of excited to find out. </p> <p><strong>If you had to rate your satisfaction with your life so far, out of 10, what would you score? </strong><br>Seven.</p> <p><em>Eric Whitacre's new album, ‘The Sacred Veil', is available now, </em><a href=\"http://smarturl.it/TheSacredVeil\"><em>smarturl.it/TheSacredVeil</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
