  "title": "Technology:  Suit Demands Search Giant Ban App Over Extremism  ----  By David Uberti",
  "text": "<p>   A Washington nonprofit is suing Alphabet Inc.'s Google over offering the social-media app Telegram in its app store, calling on the technology company to suspend the chat platform for hosting content that allegedly incites violence such as the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot. </p><p>   Filed Monday in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, the suit argues Telegram fails to meet Google Play standards for moderating extremist posts that call for violence on public channels. The complaint claims Google engages in unfair and unlawful behavior toward users by not enforcing its policies against such content, inflicting emotional distress. </p><p>   Dubai-based Telegram boasts more than 500 million users globally, many attracted by its free chat tools and privacy features. Those attributes also make it a useful platform for both political dissidents and extremists, social-media researchers say, because its public-facing channels enable recruitment and its encrypted \"Secret Chats\" tool provide secured communication for organizing. </p><p>   Marc Ginsberg, president of the Coalition for a Safer Web, a nonprofit counter-extremism group that filed the suit, said he seeks to pressure Telegram to crack down on far-right posts inciting violence as it has with jihadist content on the platform. </p><p>   \"If [Telegram] can engage in content moderation against ISIS, there's no reason why they can't clean up their act against white-supremacist illegal activities and incitement on their platform,\" said Mr. Ginsberg, a former U.S. ambassador to Morocco. </p><p>   Representatives for Google and Telegram didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>    Pavel Durov, Telegram's founder and chief executive, said in a post on his channel last week that his team saw an uptick in U.S.-related content that was reported by users in early January. Telegram \"blocked and shut down hundreds of public calls for violence that could've otherwise reached tens of thousands of subscribers,\" he said. </p><p>   \"The team continues to process reports from users in addition to proactively removing content that directly incites violence,\" Mr. Durov said. \"Telegram welcomes political debate coming from all sides of the political spectrum -- but will act swiftly to stop those who incite people to inflict harm on others.\" </p><p>    Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. increasingly have suppressed election-rigging claims and calls to violence in recent weeks. Days after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, Apple Inc. and Google suspended the conservative microblogging site Parler from their app stores while Amazon.com Inc. cut off Parler's web-hosting services. The companies cited Parler's lax approach to moderating content that could incite violence. </p><p>   Parler sued Amazon on Jan. 11, claiming the cloud provider kicked the social network off its servers for political and anticompetitive reasons. A federal judge last week didn't dismiss the suit but said Amazon has no obligation to host violent content, particularly in light of the Capitol riot. A representative for Parler didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   Mr. Ginsberg hopes Google and Apple, which his nonprofit sued on Jan. 17, will take similar action with Telegram. Both app stores' policies require developers to have systems to moderate content the tech giants deem objectionable. </p><p>   Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. The company hasn't responded to Mr. Ginsberg's lawsuit, court records show. </p><p>   The complaints argue Telegram has permitted content that incited violence, including public posts by far-right groups attempting to organize events before President Biden's inauguration last week. Keith Altman, Mr. Ginsberg's lawyer and director of national litigation at Lento Law Group PC, said he doesn't have more lawsuits in the works. </p><p>   An influx of newcomers from platforms such as Parler in recent weeks, coupled with Telegram's moves to take down some content inciting violence, have left some far-right networks on the platform in a state of confusion, said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a research analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit policy organization. </p><p>   \"If Telegram starts to take action,\" he added, \"the question is whether they're going to be doing it next week or next month or beyond that.\" </p><p></p>",
