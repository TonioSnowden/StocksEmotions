  "title": "World News:  Chinese Factories Struggle to Find Workers  ---  Covid-19 fears, youth's  changing priorities pinch  owners, as demographic  challenges mount  ----  By Stella Yifan Xie and Liyan Qi",
  "text": "<p>   Labor shortages are materializing across China as young people shun factory jobs and more migrant workers stay home, offering a possible preview of larger challenges ahead as the workforce ages and shrinks. </p><p>   With global demand for Chinese goods surging this year, factory owners say they are struggling to fill jobs that make everything from handbags to cosmetics. </p><p>   Some migrant workers are worried about catching Covid-19 in cities or factories, despite China's low caseload. Other young people are gravitating toward service-industry jobs that pay more or are less demanding. </p><p>   The trends echo similar labor-market mismatches in the U.S., where someemployers are finding it hard to hire enough workers, even though millions of people who lost jobs during the pandemic remain unemployed. But China's problems also reflect longer-term demographic shifts -- including a shrinking labor pool -- that are legacies of the country's decadeslong one-child policy,which was formally abandoned in 2016. </p><p>   Those trends pose a serious threat to China'spotential long-term growth rate. They also will make it harder for China to keep supplying the world with cheap manufactured goods, potentiallyadding to global inflationary pressures. </p><p>   \"China has long exhausted its demographic dividend,\" said Shuang Ding, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong. </p><p>   Yan Zhiqiao, who runs a cosmetics factory in the southern city of Guangzhou with about 50 workers, hasn't been able to scale up production this year despite rising demand, mainly because the factory has struggled to hire and retain staff, in particular people under 40. </p><p>   His factory offers the equivalent rate of about $3.90 an hour, which is above market, in addition to free meals and accommodation. But he has attracted few young applicants. </p><p>   He said the factory can't afford to boost salaries in large part because ofhigher raw-material prices. The other option would be to increase prices for overseas buyers. </p><p>   \"Unlike our generation, young people's attitudes toward work have changed. They can fall back on their parents and don't have much pressure to make ends meet,\" said Mr. Yan, 41 years old. \"A lot of them didn't come to the factory to work but to look for boyfriends or girlfriends.\" </p><p>   China's shortfall in factory labor comes as it grapples with the opposite problem in another part of its economy:Too many workers for white-collar jobs. More than nine million students, a record, are graduating from college this year, aggravating the structural mismatch in China's labor market, economists say. </p><p>   As China's overall surveyed urban unemployment rate edged down to 5.1% in July from 5.7% a year earlier, the jobless rate among those aged 16 to 24 was 16.2% last month, though that was lower than a record of 16.8% in July 2020. </p><p>   China's recent clampdown on the private-tutor industry,aimed at reducing educational costs for parents, risks driving up the jobless rate for young workers. The education industry absorbed more college graduates than any other in 2019, according to MyCOS, an education-consulting firm. </p><p>   For factory owners, though, those trends offer little solace. The dwindling number of manufacturing workers has forced many factories to pay bonuses or boost salaries, eroding profit margins that already were under pressure due to rising prices for raw materials andshipping. </p><p>   Foxconn Technology Group, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and one of Apple Inc.'s largest suppliers, last month raised bonuses for new recruits at a facility in Zhengzhou to 9,000 yuan -- the equivalent of about $1,388 -- or more, if they work for 90 consecutive days, according to advertisements posted by a business unit of Foxconn on WeChat. Foxconn didn't respond to requests to comment. </p><p>   With the Delta variantsweeping across other Asian countries, some Chinese factories have seen orders jump as buyers redirect business from elsewhere, said David Li, general secretary of the Asia Footwear Association in Dongguan. That has made some companies even more desperate to hire workers by raising salaries, he said. </p><p>   \"Many factory owners are in a dilemma now. They do not know whether they'll be able to make a profit if they accept new orders,\" he said. \"Their biggest headache is the struggle with finding workers.\" </p><p>   Last week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the country would continue to face \"relatively large employment pressure\" by 2025 and pledged to devote more support for labor-intensive industries, including additionalvocational training. </p><p>   China's working age population, defined as people between 15 and 59, fell to 894 million last year, or 63% of the total population. That was down from 939 million in 2010, or 70% of total population at the time, according to the country's once-in-a-decade census data. </p><p>   China's workforce is expected to drop by about 35 million over the next five years, according to official estimates. </p><p></p>",
