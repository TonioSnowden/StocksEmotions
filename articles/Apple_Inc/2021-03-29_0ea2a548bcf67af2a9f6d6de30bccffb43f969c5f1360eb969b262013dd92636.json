  "text": "<p>It's a bright day in early March, and I'm sitting at my desk engaged in a Zoom interview with New Jersey-based artist Amy Sherald, whose first West Coast solo exhibition, <em>The Great American Fact</em>, has just opened at Hauser &amp; Wirth in Los Angeles. Behind Sherald in her screen window looms a large painting of a woman's face, and I'm surprised to learn it's one of her own, an early work she keeps in order to remind herself of where she came from. </p> <p>“You make some paintings that are good but not good enough to carry you. This one reminds me of the development of my technique, and the necessity of having the patience to figure out who you really are as an artist.” </p> <p>These days, Sherald is widely celebrated. In 2016, she became the first woman and the first African American to win the National Portrait Gallery's Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, and in 2017 she was selected by then First Lady Michelle Obama to paint her presidential portrait for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, the first African American woman to receive the commission. The work, which was revealed in February 2018 alongside Kehinde Wiley's portrait of President Barack Obama, was a powerful experience for Sherald. “To be connected to her historical legacy was profound. It felt like the highest of heights.”</p> <p>Sherald's career has continued on its shooting-star trajectory: in December 2020, her work&#xa0;“The Bathers”&#xa0;(2015) sold for $4,265,000 at auction. Her figurative paintings depicting men, women and children in her trademark greyscale skin tones and colourful vibrant clothing include her 2020 portrait of Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old slain emergency room technician, whom Sherald painted for the cover of <em>Vanity Fair</em> last September; it was recently acquired by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC jointly with the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky. Yet, with such significant milestones behind her, Sherald's conviction about the importance of her subject matter only continues to intensify.</p> <p>“This new body of work [<em>The Great American Fact</em>] is what it's all about,” she says. “The large-scale paintings are the beginnings of new conversations for me but really, everything I've done up until this point could be one big show, under this title. It's about shifting perspectives on what and who people consider to be American. There are so many of us that live in this country, and if we truly believe in this American project then that's how we should visualise it.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The five pieces in the new exhibition are also a continuation of Sherald's focus on the quotidian events of black existence. “In painting the black figure, our bodies are political in a way, and these paintings are an expression of life outside of resistance. They are moments of pleasure, leisure and self-reflection.” </p> <p>She paints portraits of black people just being black people, existing in the world to be seen, respected, loved and estimated for all aspects of their personhood, especially their interior worlds. Sherald's oeuvre is centred on the shared humanity of people who aren't solely defined by their racial identity: humanness, rather than blackness, is the first qualifier. </p> <p>“I need [my work] to exist universally and to be internalised in that way, and for black people to look at it and see themselves, but also for people who aren't black to look at it and see another human being that they can relate to.”</p> <p>Until now, most of Sherald's figurative characters have been placed in monochromatic backgrounds, where a luscious colour palette of cerise and peach, teal and bubblegum pink and shades of blues, greens and yellows serves as the neutral setting. A viewer has to encounter her people simply as they are, without allusions to social status, without cues triggering restrictive or clichéd narratives. But in the new exhibition three of the five pieces, “A Midsummer Afternoon Dream”, “As American as Apple Pie” and “An Ocean Away” have specific locations and styles of dress that further challenge limited notions of black identity. “There's a simplicity about [all] the work that allows the narrative to be more salient. The clothing is 50 per cent part of that narrative, and their posture is the other 50 per cent,” Sherald says.</p> <p>These themes blossomed from her own explorations of racial identity and personhood. In the years after getting her MFA from Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore,&#xa0;Sherald moved back home to Columbus, Georgia, where she was born in 1973. Reflecting on her experiences as a black child in a predominately white community, she realised, she says, “that a lot of who I was had been a performance for people who didn't look like me, and it was connected to respectability politics. I really wanted and needed to know who I was outside of all these [racialised sociopolitical] constructs I was raised in.”</p> <p>This interrogation of her own narratives affected the way she thought about her artistic development. “I was in the sixth grade the first time I saw a real-life painting with a black person centred in it. We were on a field trip and I saw the work, ‘Object Permanence' by Bo Bartlett. That was a pivotal moment for me.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Once back in Baltimore, in 2009, she says, “I had to take a look around me, to see what was in this art canon, and what was missing. How I could authentically be myself, and still fit into this narrative and make work that is so meaningful that art history&#xa0;won't be able to be written without it?”</p> <p>She felt she had to start painting the stories she needed to see, “the everydayness of who we are, those were the stories I had really connected with in images from the past, not in paintings&#xa0;but through photography. Images of my mother or my grandmother, and other black sitters [from daguerreotypes], that were so haunting and beautiful in the energy and dignity they carried. I want my work to be a reflection of that kind of dignity and self-assertion.”</p> <p>Although the characters Sherald paints are largely based on photographs of real people she meets or invites to sit for her, once she begins a painting the sitter becomes an archetype. “The paintings are special because the people are special, but they no longer exist as themselves in my pieces.”</p> <p>Sherald's titles are quirky, beautiful and intriguing stories in themselves: “She had an inside and an outside now and suddenly she knew how not to mix them”; “What's different about Alice is that she has the most incisive way of telling the truth”. “Reading and research is important to building the language around what I do,” she says. “I find [some of] these sentences in books like [those by] bell hooks or Toni Morrison, or poems by Lucille Clifton, that really connect to the work. Others I make up.”</p> <p>Despite all her success, Sherald still sees her ability to make art as a luxury. It's something she doesn't take for granted, given, as she says, how few working and black female artists are recognised in the history books and in the world at large. “I'm inspired by all these women, Thelma Golden [director of the Studio Museum in Harlem], or Lorna Simpson, Lorraine O'Grady, and so many others who are making their work and putting it out in the world. I'm looking and I'm learning still.”&#xa0; </p> <p><em>‘The Great American Fact', to June 6, </em><a href=\"https://www.hauserwirth.com/\"><em>hauserwirth.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Enuma Okoro 2021 'Amy Sherald on making radical art from the everyday' FT.com 29 March.
