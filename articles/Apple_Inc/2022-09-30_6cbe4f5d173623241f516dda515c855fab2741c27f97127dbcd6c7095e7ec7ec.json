  "text": "<p>\"Putting right what once went wrong\" was the weekly mission of time-traveling physicist Sam Beckett, who disappeared at the end of the \"Quantum Leap\" finale of 1993. Question: If he'd \"leaped\" into, say, 2022, would he have set out to stop the remake?</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The U.S. and the Holocaust (PBS)</p><p>At the outset of \"The U.S. and the Holocaust,\" the remarkable documentary miniseries directed by Ken Burns, Lynn Novick and Sarah Botstein, a German businessman by the name of Otto Frank enjoys a stroll on a sunny day in Frankfurt in 1933 and snaps pictures of his wife, Edith, and daughters Margot, age 7, and Annelies, age 3. His ancestors had lived in Germany since the 16th century, and he is, we learn, proud to have served as an officer in World War I. What he does not know is the terrors of the future ahead, the transformation of German society that will rob him of status and very nearly his life. Or that Anne would become the author of a world-renowned diary.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Sins of Our Mother (Netflix)</p><p>When Steve Goodman and John Prine set out to write the perfect country song (\"You Never Even Called Me by My Name\"), it became clear they had to include lyrics about drinking, prison, trains, trucks and Mama. (\"I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison.\") \"Sins of Our Mother\" may not be the perfect nonfiction miniseries about American Western Gothic weirdness, but it does contain a kitchen sink's worth of true-crime ingredients and wreckage: murder, insanity, adultery, religion, doomsday scenarios. And Mama.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Woman King</p><p>Sony Pictures is positioning \"The Woman King\" as not only a rousing action film but also an important one: At the screening I attended, a marketing slide read, \"Join the conversation.\" I'll start: Is there any limit to Hollywood shamelessness?</p><p>Set in 1823 in a real West African kingdom, Dahomey (now located within Benin), the film stars Viola Davis as the commanding general who leads a battalion of women warriors called the Agojie in combat with their oppressors, the Oyo. Ms. Davis is one of those actresses who should probably be given an automatic Oscar nomination every time her name appears in a list of credits; whether she is playing a mousy mom in \"Doubt\" or the blues-singing force of nature in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" she always drills into her character, and as usual she is captivating here. Wearing a bushy mohawk, Ms. Davis's Nanisca fiercely leads her troops through exacting workouts and schools them in the group's credo: No husbands will be accepted, no children will be produced. Through the eyes of a new recruit (Thuso Mbedu, providing an appealingly shy counterpoint to Ms. Davis's ferocity) who joins the army because she is too headstrong to be married, we witness the intensive training that turned the Agojie into a brawny and pitiless infantry unit.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Lou (Netflix)</p><p>It's more of a custom than a rule, but American action-thrillers often begin in gripping, adrenaline-fueled, roller-coaster fashion and then accelerate to the point they can't move. The wall of inanity has been hit. Viewers can and do check out. So blame Allison Janney for making us linger so long over \"Lou.\"</p><p>The actress inspires considerable devotion for bringing a believable earthiness to her roles, for having thrived as long as she has in a youth-and-glamour-obsessed industry, and for having plied her trade in so many genres—from TV's \"West Wing\" and \"Mom\" to \"I, Tonya,\" for which she won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. \"Lou\" adds something novel to the Janney CV: a fugitive ex-government operative, living a quasi-survivalist lifestyle in the woods of San Juan Island in the Pacific Northwest. Ramba, so to speak.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Murders Before the Marathon (Hulu)</p><p>When three pot dealers were found dead in a Waltham, Mass., apartment in 2011, the circumstances were considered bizarre even among cases of multiple murder. The victims' throats were cut in a manner that suggested a crime of passion rather than business; marijuana was scattered over the bodies; a large amount of cash was left behind. Police took note of all this, but what they apparently disregarded was the date: Sept. 11, the 10th anniversary of the World Trade Center attack.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Barbarian</p><p>What if you were a young woman who arrived late at night to a house you rented through Airbnb, only to discover another renter was already ensconced within? What if that renter was a man, and he acted a little weird? What if a nearby medical convention meant there were no hotel rooms available in the area, and the immediate neighborhood was dangerous, and it was raining? Might you agree to stay overnight with a total stranger?</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Anthrax Attacks: In the Shadow of 9/11 (Netflix)</p><p>Since there's nothing else in the world to worry about right now, Netflix and the BBC are taking us back about 20 years to a crime that also seemed cruel and unusual in its timing—the anthrax-letter attacks that followed the events of 9/11 by a week, left five people dead, more than a dozen sickened and led to a nearly seven-year investigation by the FBI. It's a fast-paced whodunit, despite the answers to its central mystery being either memorable, or Google-able, but the reasons why may amount to spoilers. So reader beware.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Catherine Called Birdy (Prime Video)</p><p>For years on her HBO show \"Girls,\" and also in her films such as this summer's unjustly neglected \"Sharp Stick,\" the writer-director Lena Dunham has proved a savvy chronicler of narcissism in young people, particularly young women. Her willingness to have fun with the less attractive aspects of her protagonists redeems her first period piece, the 13th-century tale \"Catherine Called Birdy,\" which in more forgiving hands could have turned out to be yet another filmed young-adult novel about a clever, plucky and headstrong girl effortlessly outsmarting the men who would demean and oppress her.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Super/Natural (Disney+)</p><p>Ordinarily, the rule in nature television is that humans should be heard and not seen. And unless you're David Attenborough, even that may be going too far. But humans are animals, after all. Shouldn't they be among the players? Or even the played?</p><p>The latter, in the six-part, state-of-the-art \"Super/Natural,\" involve the vampire spiders of Lake Victoria in Kenya, which use the \"perfume\" of human blood to attract a mate; in order to get it, they go on what narrator Benedict Cumberbatch calls a \"bloodthirsty killing spree.\" (Their victims are well-fed mosquitoes.) The former include fishermen who've created a symbiotic alliance with bottle-nosed dolphins in the waters off Laguna, Brazil. There, mullets abound but are hard to catch, so the dolphins let the humans know where they've herded the smaller fish; the fishermen toss their nets in those designated spots; the throwing of the nets startles some fish into the mouths of the dolphins. Everybody wins. Except the mullets.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Deerfoot of the Diamond (ESPN)</p><p>One of my nearest and dearest, though certainly not a non-baseball fan, recently voiced outrage about the Cincinnati team, and not because they're approximately 30 games out of first place in the Central Division of the National League. \"The Reds?!\" she said—her assumption being that, like the name Washington Redskins, it either was or could be construed as some kind of racist slur. It was explained that the name was a derivation of \"Red Stockings\"—not an insult to Native-American people, or a tribute to Ohio Bolsheviks. Serenity was restored.</p><p>However: This is where we are in the evolution of cultural awareness, a somewhat perfect moment for \"Deerfoot of the Diamond,\" an ESPN production that might—as regards team names in professional sports—take some of the righteousness out of the indignation. Louis Sockalexis, a member of the National League in the late 1800s, was probably the first Native-American to play major league baseball. He came off the Penobscot reservation in Maine to become, albeit briefly, one of the great practitioners of the early game. His career eventually succumbed to injury and alcohol. The Cleveland Indians were named for him.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>So Help Me Todd (CBS)</p><p>\"So Help Me Todd,\" a new series on CBS, is nothing if not a multitasker—it quacks like a comedy, walks like \"Law &amp; Order,\" swims like a social satire and flies, albeit awkwardly, past the pigeonholes.</p><p>What is it? Charming, among other things, partly because it makes such an effort to avoid categories, partly because it has the mirthsome Marcia Gay Harden cast as uptight lawyer Margaret Wright. A prominent Portland attorney, she has a seemingly directionless son Todd (Skylar Astin) who has lost his private investigator's license over some legal trouble with the state of Oregon. (Unwarranted wiretapping, it seems). And Margaret is not one to tolerate an unambitious, underachieving child—her other son (Matthew Wilkas, later in the series) is an assistant to the governor; her daughter, Allison (the terrific Madeline Wise), is a doctor. Todd has his talents—he's a naturally gifted sleuth and enormously tech-savvy, something Margaret will realize when he comes to her rescue. Which he will do regularly, while tripping over his own feet. Which is what the series is all about.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Vesper</p><p>The dystopian sci-fi drama \"Vesper\" is a gallery of astounding images set in a weirdly enticing future. The new world it depicts is both primitive and advanced, full of richly detailed flora and fauna representing strange new species that came about after mankind experimented heavily with genetic engineering as society crumbled to dust.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Greatest Beer Run Ever (Apple TV+)</p><p>In the movies, the greatest beer run ever was in \"Smokey and the Bandit.\" Reynolds v. Gleason. No argument. In real life—according to \"The Greatest Beer Run Ever\"—the event involved one Chickie Donohue and his efforts to bring Pabst Blue Ribbon to his neighborhood cronies in uniform, serving at the height of the Vietnam War. \"It may be idiotic,\" says one jaded correspondent in a Saigon bar, taking the measure Chickie's mission, \"but it's a noble gesture.\" Audiences will agree on both counts.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Last Out (PBS)</p><p>Of the fewer than 1,000 players in Major League Baseball on this year's Opening Day, 99 were from the Dominican Republic, which seems like a lot (though the names included Pujols, Soto, Marte, Guerrero and Seguro). Twenty-three are from Cuba—which will also seem like a lot, but only after watching \"The Last Out.\"</p><p>Shot over four years, the documentary follows several Cuban baseball players, principally pitchers Happy Oliveros, Carlos O. González and Victor Baró, as the MLB hopefuls circumvent the U.S. embargo that's been in place since the '60s. To do so, they have to establish residency elsewhere (Costa Rica in this case) and thus make themselves \"free agents\" eligible to play on an American major league team. \"Last Out\" is, inevitably, an immigration story as well as a baseball story, but sports-oriented skulduggery is as important to the narrative as casual bribery at the borders and wading across rivers in the dark with a baby in your arms.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>What To Watch: The 15 Best New Movies and TV Shows From September</p>",
