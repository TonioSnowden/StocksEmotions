  "text": "<p>This year the attraction of Chinese wealth and power are gone. The striking message of the games so far is that the FBI has advised Americans to leave their iPhones and computers at home and carry burner phones instead. The burners will be harder for China's extensive system of surveillance to track and listen in on unacceptable thoughts.</p><p>A member of China's Olympic organizing committee has warned visiting athletes that they could be punished if they offer any political gesture or criticism. The Games that were conceived to forge international understanding have become an exercise in enforcing China's authoritarian values.</p><p>One question is how NBC will handle all this in its broadcasts to U.S. audiences. The company paid some $12 billion for the exclusive TV and digital rights to the Olympics through 2032. Feel-good stories about American athletes are always the heart of its coverage.</p><p>But will the network also become a vehicle for conveying Chinese propaganda about its happy, pollution-free, superior government and society? Will the network ignore the Uyghur concentration camps, the arrest of dissenters and their lawyers, the crushing of Hong Kong and the threats of war against Taiwan?</p><p>\"We stand for press access and freedom globally, and we resist efforts to influence our coverage or impede our access,\" NBCUniversal told us in a statement. But there's reason to wonder after MSNBC senior producer Kyle Griffin tweeted recently about \"China's alleged human rights abuses.\" Alleged?</p><p>We wish the athletes the best. But no one should ignore the Communist Party's crushing political and economic control that stands behind the airbrushed TV images of these Games.</p>",
