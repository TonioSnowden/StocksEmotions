  "text": "<p>Regular readers of my column should have the iPhone No-Buy Rule[TM] committed to memory. Once the Memorial Day weekend barbecue leftovers are gone, it's time to stop phone shopping and wait until September for Apple's new iPhones. Last year, I expanded that guidance to other Apple products and I'm glad I did. Things are even more nuanced this year.</p><p>First, we're right on the heels of an Apple April bonanza, where the company launched new editions of products ranging from the iMac to the Apple TV remote. Second, earlier this week Apple kicked off its Worldwide Developers Conference with details about iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey and WatchOS 8 coming this fall. Apple didn't announce any hardware, but the software news gave hints of what's to come.</p><p>An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on any future Apple products.</p><p>So you might want to spend any extra cash on a superyacht or a fully loaded hot dog at the ball game, or save it for the fall. No matter what, consult my Apple Do/Don't Buy list first.</p><p>iPhone</p><p>The answer is no. No, not even that new purple one. No iPhone buying right now.</p><p>I don't expect a radically new iPhone this fall, something that triggers what the industry calls a buying super cycle. Last year, Apple overhauled the iPhone and added 5G. That means this year we'll likely see a few key updates while Apple keeps the same overall design. Reports point to a screen with a higher refresh rate and better cameras. Maybe bigger batteries.</p><p>If you don't care about the cutting edge, why can't you just buy an older model now? $100, that's why. Historically, Apple drops the price on popular models as they age out. Last October, the iPhone 11 dropped from $699 to $599 and the XR dropped from $599 to $499.</p><p>Plus, iOS 15 will come free to all iPhones that run iOS (iPhone 6S and later). The new FaceTime, notification, messaging and weather features might be enough to make your current iPhone feel new.</p><p>AirPods</p><p>It's been 1,000 years -- in Apple years -- since the entry-level white ear sticks have been updated. That seems to be set to change this fall. The next earbuds are expected to have shorter stems, a new case and improved fitness-tracking features, according to a Bloomberg report.</p><p>Plus, Apple said iOS 15 will make the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max easier to find if they are lost. Like AirTags, they will work with Apple's Find My network and have better alarms to help locate them if they are lost nearby.</p><p>What about the AirPods Pro released in late 2019? Those fall into the proceed-with-caution zone. The Bloomberg report says a new version is in the works but might not arrive until 2022.</p><p>If you're looking for bigger noise-canceling headphones, you're fine with the AirPods Max. Those were released last December and aren't likely to be refreshed soon.</p><p>Apple Watch</p><p>Apple Watches don't get redesigns very often: In fact, it's only been redesigned once in a big way since its launch, and that was with the Series 4 in 2018. We're due for one in the next year or two, and noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that it's in the works for this year.</p><p>Various reports say the next watch could have new health-tracking features, including glucose monitoring.</p><p>Either way, I'd wait until the fall, if only for the price drops. Last year, Apple confused things by introducing two models, the $399 Series 6 and the $279 SE, while dropping the Series 3 price to $199. I even preferred the SE to the 6: most of the features, $120 less. Apple will likely tweak the lineup again, bringing the newer watches to lower price points.</p><p>iPad</p><p>You're good to go on the iPads -- the regular-size ones, anyway. In April, the iPad Pro got a new screen, M1 processor and some new webcam tricks. The iPad Air was significantly improved last October with a new design, including a fingerprint scanner in the edge.</p><p>All of those models and more will get iPadOS 15 in the fall. I'm excited for the new multitasking controls, which no longer require some sort of secret handshake to place two apps side by side. The new home-screen layout and Quick Notes look cool, too.</p><p>One iPad that you should absolutely not buy? The Mini. Last upgraded -- minimally -- in 2019, it's overdue for a real rejuvenation.</p><p>iMac</p><p>OK, pay close attention, Mac buyers.</p><p>If you want a beautiful and fast iMac, the new 24-inch iMac, powered by Apple's M1 chip, gets the green light. I reviewed it and loved working on it for the past month.</p><p>If you want a replacement to the current 27-inch iMac -- something with a bigger screen and more power -- hold off. Bloomberg and others report Apple is working on a chip that's faster than Apple's current M1, and that it will be in this new machine, possibly with a larger display.</p><p>MacBook Air and Pro</p><p>That brings us to the laptops. Apple kept the design of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air but swapped Intel chips for its own M1 chips last November -- making them virtually the best laptops out there. They're fast, but run cool and quiet.</p><p>Yet they're expected to get even better this fall -- at least the MacBook Pro is. Reports from Bloomberg, Taiwan's DigiTimes and Mr. Kuo say Apple is readying Pro laptops with 14- and 16-inch screens, powered by that faster chip. The update sounds big: new designs plus the return of MagSafe charging and other ports, including an SD card slot.</p><p>If you really need a laptop for back-to-school season, I'd opt for the cheapest Air.</p><p>Apple TV</p><p>If you need a new streaming box and aren't tempted by a more affordable Roku, Chromecast or Amazon Fire stick, Apple just refreshed the $179 Apple TV 4K with a faster processor and new Siri remote.</p><p>If your Apple TV is fine, and you just want to stop the pain and suffering caused by the old remote, the new one, sold separately for $59, is the must-have upgrade of the year. It's bigger and it has a touch-enabled click pad at the top (so you can tell which end is up).</p><p>Speaking of media devices, Apple's $100 HomePod Mini is safe right now.</p><p>As I say every year, if your current gadgets are on their last legs, look to repair what's broken, or find a deal wherever you can. Don't pay full price!</p>",
