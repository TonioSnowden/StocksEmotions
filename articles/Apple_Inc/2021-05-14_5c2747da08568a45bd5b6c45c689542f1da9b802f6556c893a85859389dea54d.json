  "text": "<p>\"At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted,\" an Apple spokesman said. \"Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here.\"</p><p>Mr. Garcia Martinez didn't respond to multiple messages seeking comment late Wednesday. A LinkedIn page for him listed him as working in \"Product Engineering, Ads Platforms\" at Apple, and says he started there last month.</p><p>Apple has largely avoided the sort of public controversy among employees over issues of gender and race that have shaken other big tech companies in recent years. Chief Executive Tim Cook has made it a pillar of his leadership at the company to publicly champion diversity and equality.</p><p>Some Apple employees communicated their concern and anger Tuesday over Mr. Garcia Martinez's hiring on Slack messaging groups, one Apple employee said. Several Apple employees complained publicly Wednesday about the company's decision to hire Mr. Garcia Martinez, citing passages from his 2016 book.</p><p>A group of employees circulated a letter to Apple senior executive Eddy Cue, who oversees internet software and services, asking for an investigation into how Mr. Garcia Martinez was hired, according to one of the employees who signed it. Technology-news site the Verge reported on the letter earlier Wednesday.</p><p>The letter described as misogynistic statements in Mr. Garcia Martinez's book that it said run counter to Apple's commitments to inclusion and diversity, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The letter highlighted the way in which a number of passages in the book refer to women. In one, Mr. Garcia Martinez wrote: \"Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.\"</p><p>In other passages, he referred to women based on his attraction to their bodies and said \"most women\" at Facebook and in the Bay Area didn't know \"how to dress.\" In another passage dealing with fundraising, he said an \"equity round is having to convince five women to do a sixsome with you,\" he wrote.</p><p>---</p><p>Tim Higgins contributed to this article.</p>",
