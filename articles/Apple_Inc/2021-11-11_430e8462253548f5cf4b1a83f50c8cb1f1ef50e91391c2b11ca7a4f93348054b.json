  "text": "<p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>Will Ferrell says that the only sad part about making \"The Shrink Next Door\" with Paul Rudd was the realization that it took them so long to find something new to work on together.</p><p>\"Man,\" says Mr. Rudd, who starred with Mr. Ferrell in films including \"Anchorman\" and \"Anchorman 2.\" \"I feel the exact same way.\"</p><p>\"The Shrink Next Door\" stars Mr. Rudd as Dr. Ike Herschkopf, a psychiatrist who manipulated one of his patients (Mr. Ferrell's Marty Markowitz) for decades, gaining access to his money, property and ultimately isolating him from his family.</p><p>The series, which debuts Friday on Apple TV+, is based on the hit true-crime podcast of the same name hosted by Joe Nocera.</p><p>Across a pair of joint interviews, the stars said there was never a big conversation to hash out who was going to play whom. Mr. Rudd said he could tell Mr. Ferrell was going to be able to inhabit both the sweetness and woundedness of Mr. Markowitz.</p><p>\"We'd be in a therapy session saying our lines,\" he says, \"but I would look into his face and he would break my heart.\"</p><p>Mr. Ferrell said he thought Mr. Rudd was perfect for Dr. Ike, as his character calls him, because he had the acting chops to be \"charismatic enough to reel me in\" and \"nuanced enough to change gears and get me to do the things he wanted me to do without me knowing it.\"</p><p>\"That is such a nice answer,\" Mr. Rudd responded, \"and totally different than what I thought you were going to say.\"</p><p>Asked what he thought Mr. Ferrell was going to say, Mr. Rudd laughed and said: \"Uh, the clothes fit too well.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Mayor of Kingstown'</p><p>(Paramount +)</p><p>\"Mayor of Kingstown,\" a new drama that premieres Sunday on the Paramount+ streaming service, is about a pair of power-broker brothers in Kingstown, Mich., where the major industry is private prisons -- and the drugs, smuggling and gangland commerce that bleeds between their walls. Mike McLusky (Jeremy Renner) and Mitch McLusky (Kyle Chandler) pull strings and arrange deals with inmates, gang members and other interests that influence Kingstown life on both sides of the prison walls.</p><p>Dianne Wiest plays the mother of the power brokers and a third brother, a police officer. Ms. Wiest, who won Academy Awards for her performances in the Woody Allen films \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" and \"Bullets Over Broadway,\" says she has actually been trying to avoid motherhood roles in recent years.</p><p>\"I don't want to do domestic mothering stuff anymore,\" she says. \"Somehow, for whatever reason -- I'm still uncertain why -- I became the mother and nothing else. And, wow, is that not interesting.\"</p><p>The role of Mariam McLusky, she says, is different. She's a mother only in the sense that women of her age often are mothers. But here, she's a hardened teacher in Kingstown women's prison with no interest in or patience for the way her power-broking sons run their lives and business.</p><p>\"The less I have to do with this family,\" she says of her character, \"the better off I am.\"</p>",
