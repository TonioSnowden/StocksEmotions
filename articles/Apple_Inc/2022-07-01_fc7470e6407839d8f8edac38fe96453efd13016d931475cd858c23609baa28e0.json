  "title": "Delta Air Lines, Nike, Snap: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news",
  "text": "<p>CVS Health Corp.</p><p>The Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade changed how major retailers sell emergency contraceptive pills. As demand for the pills has risen following the decision that overturned a constitutional right to abortion, CVS, Walmart Inc. and Rite Aid Corp. imposed purchase limits on the pills. CVS and Rite Aid limited purchases to three, and Walmart limited orders to 10. The pills are often referred to as and sold under the Plan B brand without a prescription. Some retailers' websites indicated that the emergency contraceptive was in short supply. CVS shares declined 1.4% Tuesday.</p><p>Nike Inc.</p><p>Nike is still trying to outrun its supply-chain challenges. The sneaker maker reported quarterly sales that were roughly flat and a 23% increase in inventory in the recent period compared with the prior year. Matthew Friend, Nike's finance chief, said that extended production and shipping times caused about two-thirds of the company's inventory to be caught in transit at the end of the quarter. Transit times aren't expected to significantly improve during the coming fiscal year, he said. Executives forecast stronger revenue growth for the year started June 1, but said near-term profit would be hurt by elevated shipping costs. Nike shares lost 7% Tuesday.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond swept out its CEO in yet another housecleaning for the home-goods giant. The announcement that Mark Tritton would be succeeded on an interim basis by independent director Sue Gove came as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond reported a plunge in quarterly sales that it attributed to a mismatch between what stores carried and what shoppers wanted. Mr. Tritton tried to overhaul the chain by cleaning up crowded aisles, scaling back coupons and doing away with popular national brands in favor of private-label goods. The board decided Ms. Gove would step in while it searches for a permanent successor. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares plummeted 24% Wednesday.</p><p>Snap Inc.</p><p>Snap is trying to break its reliance on advertising. The social-media company unveiled Snapchat+, a subscription plan for its disappearing-photo app that will cost $3.99 a month and give users access to exclusive features on the app. Snap is the latest social-media platform to seek revenue beyond advertising, as the industry grapples with obstacles like Apple Inc.'s privacy-policy changes that make it harder to sell targeted advertising. Twitter Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook have launched similar subscription plans in recent years to make money off their most passionate users by offering extra features. Snap shares added 1.7% Wednesday.</p><p>General Mills Inc.</p><p>Shoppers are willing to pay up for their Cheerios and Betty Crocker cake mix. General Mills said higher prices helped lift sales in its latest quarter, even as the food maker sold fewer items across the board. The company expects costs to rise at a double-digit rate over the next year, and it is planning more price increases for consumers to protect profit amid persistent inflation. General Mills has been raising its products' prices in different ways, including list price increases and changing packaging and sizes to charge more per ounce. General Mills shares rose 6.3% Wednesday.</p><p>Constellation Brands Inc.</p><p>Consumers' thirst for beer is keeping Constellation Brands refreshed. Quarterly sales for the maker of Modelo and Corona grew by almost 17%, with strong demand for the company's beers helping offset rising brewing, transportation and raw-material costs. The company expects beer sales to rise 7% to 9% in fiscal 2023, leading sales growth. The company is raising prices to offset the costs, but recent actions weren't enough to keep operating margins from falling in the latest quarter. Separately, Constellation said its board agreed to a plan that would see the controlling Sands family relinquish majority voting power. Constellation shares gained 4.3% Thursday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Delta Air Lines, Nike, Snap: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
