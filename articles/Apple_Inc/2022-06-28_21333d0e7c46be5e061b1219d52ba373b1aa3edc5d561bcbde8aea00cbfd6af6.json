  "title": "Menstrual Apps Vow Privacy --- After abortion ruling, concern rises over period trackers",
  "text": "<p>Creators of some of those apps are now seeking ways to ensure that they don't have specific information to share about their users in the first place.</p><p>Natural Cycles, the first birth-control app cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, is working to build a \"completely anonymous experience for users,\" said Raoul Scherwitzl, the company's co-founder and co-chief executive.</p><p>\"The goal is to make it so no one -- not even us at Natural Cycles -- can identify the user,\" Mr. Scherwitzl said, adding that it is a technical challenge.</p><p>Flo announced it will soon launch a feature called \"Anonymous Mode,\" which will give users the option to remove their personal information from their Flo account, a spokeswoman said. The company plans to share more details on the feature in the coming weeks.</p><p>Different types of digital breadcrumbs, including information that can be subpoenaed from period trackers, can create detailed profiles of users when put together, according to legal experts. Phone and app data have long been shared and sold without prominent disclosure, often for advertising purposes.</p><p>And health apps -- except for data shared between you and your healthcare provider -- typically don't fall under protections from HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.</p><p>Even before Roe was overturned, menstrual data has been used in government investigations, said Leah Fowler, research director at University of Houston's Health Law and Policy Institute. In a 2019 hearing, Missouri's state health department admitted to keeping a spreadsheet of Planned Parenthood abortion patients, which included the dates of their last menstrual period.</p><p>There are steps users can take to select the most secure period-tracking app, The Wall Street Journal detailed in an earlier report. That includes reviewing an app's privacy policy for details on what steps it takes to protect customer data, if it shares or sells your information, and how the company responds to government requests.Apple says data from its Health app can't be shared or sold because it is encrypted end-to-end.</p><p>While many on social media suggested deleting period-tracking apps after the decision was announced, doing so isn't an instant fix.</p><p>\"Deleting your app from your phone does not always mean you've deleted your data anywhere other than your device,\" Prof. Fowler said. \"Sometimes you have to contact an app's customer-service support team directly to ensure that your historical data has been wiped on the developer's end.\"</p><p>Users can also check the company's privacy policies, where information on how to delete data is often provided.</p><p>Both Clue and Flo provide email addresses to contact to request data deletion. Natural Cycles users can send a request to the company's support team via a link on the company's website. Data deletion can take up to a month at some of the companies.</p><p>---</p><p>Nicole Nguyen contributed to this article.</p>",
