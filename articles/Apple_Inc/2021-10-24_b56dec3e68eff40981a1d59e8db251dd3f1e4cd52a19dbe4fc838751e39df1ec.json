  "title": "Bug Question: To Smush or Not to Smush the Spotted Lanternfly? States want people to kill the pretty pests, but some feel conflicted about 'that murderous rage of squashing'",
  "text": "<p>\"I wish there was something other than like that murderous rage of squashing them that we could do,\" said Jerome Eno, a photographer who lives in Philadelphia. Mr. Eno, who has been encountering the bugs for several years, says he appreciates their unique beauty—even if he is following orders to kill them.</p><p>He has photographed the insects in their nymph stages, when they display different colors. \"When they're full grown, they look like these crazy polka-dot butterflies,\" he said.</p><p>Sara London, a freelance writer in Queens, N.Y., saw a poster in Central Park this summer with a picture of the offending insect. So she was somewhat prepared when she encountered one on her terrace a few weeks later, and, after a short battle, squished it with a floor mat.</p><p>\"It was just, well, I'm supposed to do this and I don't like killing stuff, especially if it's pretty, but you know, if it helps the environment in any way, I do what I can,\" she said.</p><p>In September, she posted a photo of the lanternfly she stepped on, wings splayed to reveal its red underwings, on Twitter. \"killed a spotted lanternfly today,\" she wrote. \"was it justifiable homicide? will i be acquitted of this crime? please defend me @NYCParks i won't do well in prison.\"</p><p>A reply message from the New York City Parks Department account read: \"Have no fear, you are a civic hero!\" It encouraged citizens: \"be like Sara! If you see a spotted lanternfly, squish it, dispose of it, and report it to us.\"</p><p>Parks and agriculture officials say the bugs pose a threat to local agriculture, including grapevines, essential to New York's wine industry. They can also weaken trees and harm native plants.</p><p>The invasive speciesfirst arrived in the U.S. from Asia in 2014, when they were spotted in Pennsylvania. They have since moved on to nearly a dozen states, including New York.</p><p>States have been sounding the alarm on lanternflies, advising people to wipe them out. Residents share stories and tips on social-media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, posting pictures, asking questions, and racking up kill counts. There have been group events, including a Squishathon at a state park on Staten Island, and another in New Jersey using the tracking app Squishr, where people keep track and compete.</p><p>Jessica Ware, associate curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History, says this summer was \"a real boon\" for the spotted lanternflies. \"We're now just kind of finding out the full extent of how far individuals traveled this summer. They're very good hitchhikers,\" Dr. Ware said.</p><p>Fall is when the spotted lanternflies are laying eggs, she said, which will hatch in the spring.</p><p>A multiagency response to the lanternflies in New York is being led by the state Department of Agriculture and Markets, said Chris Logue, director in the division of plant industry. The insect uses a \"piercing sucking mouth part\" to feed on trees, he said. \"So they are pulling the sap out of whatever plant that they are feeding on, and they're also excreting a material that's called honeydew,\" a sugary substance.</p><p>The problem, experts say, is the sooty fungus or mold that grows on those excretions. \"That actually can kill the plant,\" Dr. Ware said. \"That would be economic devastation. Apples, grapes…there's so many host trees that they can go to.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, on its website, says if the spotted lanternfly is allowed to spread in the U.S., \"this pest could seriously impact the country's grape, orchard, and logging industries.\"</p><p>For Marisa Kuras, who lives in Brooklyn, it was a tricky subject. She said her 3-year-old son, Leif, loves insects, and had a lot of questions about why people were being told to smush spotted lanternflies. She tried to explain the harm they can cause during a recent scouting trip for cicada exoskeletons and spotted lanternflies. They didn't find any lanternflies.</p><p>Ms. Kuras was on her roof deck when she spotted one. She caught it in a bowl and waited until her son came home from preschool to show it to him. She says she tried to make it a learning experience—observing and appreciating the bug, but also understanding the harm it could cause.</p><p>\"I kind of kept it there all day under its little glass thing, and when my son got home we were observing it for a long time and then I'm like, 'well, we have to smush it now.' And I brought out a shoe,\" she said. \"It goes against everything you tell your kids, you know, respecting nature yet let's, you know, go and kill this bug, specifically.\"</p><p>Kate Shapero, a science teacher at the Miquon School in Conshohocken, Pa., is familiar with those tough lessons. In the fall of 2019, the school organized an all-school hike, with students from nursery through sixth grade attending. Ms. Shapero knew the topic of spotted lanternflies was going to come up—she had seen kids trying to smoosh them.</p><p>So she delivered a speech, a version of which she later posted online, about questions kids might be grappling with amid the directive to kill.</p><p>\"The message that I hoped to send was, 'can you put a pause on the gleeful killing?\" she said.</p><p>\"If we're doing something because we think it's important, we might do it in a very different way than we do it if we're doing it to put on a show,\" she said. \"Some kids were really getting into the showmanship of...eliminating them. That was a part that just felt kind of gross.\"</p><p>Ms. Shapero said talking about it helped students think more carefully about what they were doing. It also helped foster an appreciation for the insects. The students spent time catching, observing, and drawing pictures of them.</p><p>This summer, Ms. Shapero saw fewer spotted lanternflies in her area. She also observed praying mantises feeding on them. So she hasn't been as aggressive stamping them out, although she has scraped off egg masses she found on trees.</p><p>She admits she's conflicted, and her reaction varies from time to time.</p><p>\"Part of me would kind of be like, 'ah, I'm not really up for killing them today.' And then as a scientist, another part of me would say, like, 'I also really like having food and forestry.' And so other days, I'd be out there scraping eggs. And if I'd see them, I'd whack them.\"</p><p>Write to Annmarie Fertoli at annmarie.fertoli@wsj.com</p><p>Bug Question: To Smush or Not to Smush the Spotted Lanternfly?</p>",
