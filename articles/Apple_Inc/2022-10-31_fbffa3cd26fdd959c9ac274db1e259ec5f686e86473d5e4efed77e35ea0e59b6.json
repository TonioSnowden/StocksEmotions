  "title": "Garmin Watches Win Devotees --- Long battery life, GPS, training features work for athletes",
  "text": "<p>Most smartwatches double as fitness trackers, offering GPS, heart-rate and sleep tracking. Garmin wearers tend to spend lots of time outdoors doing activities that require long battery life, accurate GPS tracking, mapping capabilities and advanced training features.</p><p>Garmin's watches aren't as connected as rival smartwatches, although they work with both iOS and Android platforms, and do have some smart functionality, such as contactless pay and notifications for calls and texts.</p><p>Globally, Apple Watch accounts for over 36% of wearables sold, followed by Samsung with 10%, according to Counterpoint Research. But in the premium, over-$500 category, Garmin is the leader.</p><p>This year, Samsung released a $450 Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, while Apple launched a $799 Apple Watch Ultra. The new watches have more rugged cases and bigger batteries, but neither is a Garmin killer. Here's why.</p><p>Battery life: Garmin's Fenix series (starts at $700) can last over a week and a half with normal use, and three days while tracking GPS on a single charge. A built-in solar charging panel provides even more juice, so long as it's sunny. Another model, the Enduro 2 ($1,100) optimized for ultra-long-distance racers, can last three times longer in each of those scenarios. Even the relatively lightweight Forerunner 955 ($600 and up) lasts nearly two days while recording GPS. For most Garmin models, the big reason for the longer battery life is the lack of a touch screen. The few that do have them allow you to turn them off for power savings.</p><p>The Apple Watch Ultra, meanwhile, lasts about a day and a half with normal use. With a low-power workout mode, which reduces the frequency of GPS and heart-rate sampling, it can run two and a half days. Samsung claims about three days for its Galaxy Watch 5 Pro.</p><p>Physical buttons: Generally, touch screens are easy to navigate.But when you're moving, or when your fingers are wet (e.g., sweating), tactile buttons are best for starting and stopping activities, and scrolling to see different metrics. That said, Garmin's many buttons can also make performing simple tasks feel complicated.</p><p>Training, competition and sport-specific features: Garmins can tell you how fast you should run during a race. For noncompetition sports, such as surfing, Garmin can report wave height and speed, while for backcountry skiing, the watch shows metrics such as vertical feet climbed. The watch also suggests how many hours you should rest after each workout, based on the activity's intensity and your sleep quality.</p><p>Recovery features are largely missing on Apple Watch. Apple's emphasis on \"closing your rings\" daily doesn't reflect many athletes' reality -- that intense sports require a mix of training and rest to avoid injury. Other, more basic health wearables, such as those from Fitbit and Oura, incorporate a \"readiness score\" that offers insight into your body's recovery. Some third-party apps for the Apple Watch offer similar functionality, for a monthly fee.</p><p>GPS navigation: Many Garmin watches use multiple satellite systems to increase location accuracy in difficult environments. Garmins can help if you get lost, with preloaded topographic maps.</p><p>Apple's step-retracing Backtrack feature could help if you get lost, but it won't help you find your way on an unfamiliar route. Samsung's watch allows you to import map files, but won't help with routing.</p>",
