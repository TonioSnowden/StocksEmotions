  "title": "Senate Votes to Advance Same-Sex Marriage Legislation; A dozen Republicans join Democrats in vote, which opens effort to pass bill in both houses of Congress by end of year",
  "text": "<p>The Respect for Marriage Act, if signed into law, would codify the ability of same-sex as well as interracial couples to get married and require states to recognize the marriages, rights established in Supreme Court rulings. The bill needed 60 votes to proceed under Senate rules.</p><p>The proposal faces at least one more vote in the Senate and would need approval by the House by the end of the year to become law. Mr. Biden reiterated Wednesday that he backed the legislation, and the House is expected to pass it after approving a similar bill earlier this year.</p><p>A dozen Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the measure. Historically, many in the GOP have opposed same-sex marriage, and the vote was seen as a test of how much lawmakers' stances have shifted in recent years amid growing public support.</p><p>\"While I believe in traditional marriage,\" said Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah), \"this legislation provides certainty to many LGBTQ Americans, and it signals that Congress—and I—esteem and love all of our fellow Americans equally.\"</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) voted against the measure.</p><p>The legislation would also repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and woman. The act passed the Senate in 1996 by an 85-14 margin and was signed into law by former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Court rulings later invalidated it.</p><p>\"While it's true that this law is not currently enforceable…it still represents Congress's last word on the subject,\" said Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), who voted in favor of Wednesday's measure.</p><p>A May poll by Gallup found that 71% of Americans say they support legal same-sex marriage, up from 27% in 1996 when the organization said it first surveyed Americans on the issue.</p><p>Former Democratic President Barack Obama opposed same-sex marriage before shifting to support it in 2012. Mr. Obama had faced pressure to lay out a clear stance on the issue after Mr. Biden, then the vice president, endorsed it.</p><p>The measure faces opposition from some conservative and religious groups. In September, the Alliance Defending Freedom sent a letter signed by more than 2,000 churches and ministries to U.S. senators about parts of the legislation that they said could jeopardize religious freedoms.</p><p>Lawmakers have changed the wording of the legislation in response to concerns about how it would affect religious groups. The latest version says nonprofit religious groups won't be compelled to participate in or support a same-sex marriage. Declining to do so wouldn't put the group's tax-exempt status at risk, lawmakers behind the measure said.</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), who voted against the measure, said the religious liberty protections were \"severely anemic and largely illusory\" despite the changes.</p><p>Roger Severino, vice president of domestic policy at the Heritage Foundation, said the legislation's wording on tax-exempt status doesn't provide affirmative protection that such a loss wouldn't happen in the future.</p><p>\"This bill puts a giant target on the back of individuals, nonprofit organizations, adoption agencies, schools, and businesses that hold fast to the truth about marriage,\" he said.</p><p>The amended legislation, if it passes the Senate, then would have to be approved by the House by the end of December to become law. Unknown is whether a Republican-controlled House would be willing to revisit the matter once new members arrive in January if it isn't passed this session.</p><p>The congressional effort to pass a same-sex marriage bill started after the Supreme Court ended the federal right to an abortion in June.</p><p>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas indicated, in his opinion concurring with the majority in the abortion case, that the court should review same-sex marriage rights down the road. No other justices said they shared the stance, but activists said lawmakers needed to move quickly to protect same-sex marriage while Democrats still had control of both houses of Congress and the White House.</p><p>\"The Supreme Court should not be in a position to undermine the stability of families with a stroke of a pen, so now Congress must act,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D., Wis.), the first openly gay senator, on the Senate floor on Wednesday.</p><p>Some Republican lawmakers have said same-sex marriage wasn't at risk and the bill was unnecessary.</p><p>\"I see no indication whatsoever that the United States Supreme Court is going to overturn the law, so what problem are we trying to solve here?\" Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.) said Wednesday, on why he voted against it.</p><p>The House, controlled by the Democrats, passed a bill in July protecting same-sex marriage, drawing the support of 47 Republicans, surprising supporters and signaling to Senate lawmakers that the measure had a serious shot at passage.</p><p>Same-sex marriage supporters say outreach efforts have focused on Republicans who represent swing states and those who have family members who would be affected by the legislation. Former Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, who is gay, said he has talked with Republican senators as part of a group called Centerline Action, which is advocating for same-sex marriage protection.</p><p>From his conversations in recent months, he said in an interview, it is clear that Republican lawmakers \"know people who are in relationships that are concerned\" about losing their marriage protections.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy nonprofit, organized a letter signed by more than 225 companies, including Starbucks Corp., Apple Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., urging lawmakers to support same-sex marriage protections.</p><p>Write to Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com</p><p>Senate Votes to Advance Same-Sex Marriage Legislation</p>",
