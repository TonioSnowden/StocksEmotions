  "text": "<p>\n  Mean Baby </p><p>\n  By Selma Blair </p><p>\n  (Knopf, 320 pages, $30) </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For much of her life, Selma Blair has consulted tarot-card readers, mediums, fortune tellers, numerologists and astrologers. When she moved from her native Michigan to New York City after college to try her luck as an actress, she sought guidance from a local psychic. \"You will have a horrible disease,\" she was told. At another pivotal point, Ms. Blair, a stand-out in movies like \"Cruel Intentions,\" \"Legally Blonde\" and \"Hellboy,\" turned to a highly touted mystic who had reportedly prognosticated for presidents. \"You will go through a very hard time,\" he said. </p><p>\n  \"Through all the messages and predictions I'd heard . . . there was always a common refrain. They all noted I had a darkness around me,\" Ms. Blair writes in her memoir, \"Mean Baby.\" Its often bleak content -- a difficult childhood, sexual assault by a prep-school mentor, depression, an eating disorder, substance abuse, ill-advised relationships, suicide attempts, stints in rehab and, in 2018, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis -- suggests that the clairvoyants got it right. </p><p>\n  The memoir's title derives from a nickname that Ms. Blair was given in infancy, a reference to a postnatal glower that seemingly wouldn't quit. \"I came into this world with my mouth pulled into a perpetual snarl,\" she writes. \"No one knew quite what to make of it.\" Really, no one quite knew what to make of her. </p><p>\n  The youngest of four girls, Ms. Blair was raised in suburban Detroit in a fitfully observant Jewish family -- her mother, Molly, was half-Anglican. For a time, little Selma attended Hillel, a religious day school where she developed a strong attachment to Anne Frank. \"Even though my mother herself didn't identify as Jewish,\" she writes, \"it was important to her that I did. . . . This became my first big role: to perform Jewishness.\" It was all pretty confusing: scallops, decidedly not kosher, were sometimes served for dinner. </p><p>\n  As a kid, she was emotionally fragile, beset by mysterious aches and ailments -- MS may have begun assaulting her nervous system long before it was diagnosed. She was also in thrall to glamorous, narcissistic, now-I-love-you, now-I-don't Molly, a magistrate judge who was pretty judgmental. \"How can you be so beautiful from one angle and so ugly full face?\" she wondered of her daughter. Presumably a rhetorical question. Asked by a young Selma if she had loved her from the start, Molly hedged; as she explained, she wasn't sure she really wanted another child: \"I already had three daughters.\" </p><p>\n  But give Mom this: She was supportive when it counted. \"When I was in middle school, she told me that if things got really bad, we could always go into the garage together,\" Ms. Blair writes. \"We could turn on the Corvette, seal the doors, and breathe until we didn't.\" Wait. What? </p><p>\n  Ms. Blair presents these and other shockers -- she has been raped \"multiple times\"; she began getting drunk regularly in the third grade (\"I won't tell your mother\" her father said when he first caught her tippling) -- with a matter-of-factness that can be viewed as a coping strategy or as frustrating glibness. Safe to say, as role models, Ms. Blair's parents left her less than well-equipped for what was to come: success, celebrity -- and, well, adulthood. </p><p>\n  Readers who are hoping for some dropped names won't be disappointed. Ms. Blair recalls fashion shoots with the photographers Annie Leibovitz and Steven Meisel and the designer Karl Lagerfeld. She writes with palpable affection and admiration about show-biz cronies like Sarah Michelle Gellar, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, Carrie Fisher and Jake Gyllenhaal. Of Reese Witherspoon, her \"Cruel Intentions\" and \"Legally Blonde\" colleague, she writes: \"It was clear to me that she was going to be a superstar. Everything about her was impeccable.\" She was less bullish about her own prospects. \"Eccentric, weird prudes became my bread and butter. . . . Always the mean baby. . . . I had a hunch I was not going to be a leading lady.\" Fine with her: \"I still consider myself one of the luckiest girls in Hollywood.\" </p><p>\n  Ms. Blair engages with her MS starkly and movingly: \"You feel trapped, a hostage inside your own skin. You are a stranger to you.\" Still, \"Mean Baby\" is tough going. Some of the trouble can be put down to an abundance of \"look, Ma, I'm writing\" turns of phrase. The first sentence sets the tone: \"I'm not sure how to harness my meandering thoughts into words and sentences that make sense.\" And this: \"Words are the connection linking me to everyone else. . . . Words were a discovery, threads of humanity connecting us across time and place.\" </p><p>\n  But much of the difficulty in \"Mean Baby\" comes from witnessing Ms. Blair's ceaselessly bad decision-making: She avails herself of the line of white powder in a hotel room populated by a \"small wealthy group of icons\" the night before the 2009 Met Gala. What she assumes was cocaine -- she'd never tried before, so why not? -- was likely crystal meth. She gets engaged to musician Ahmet Zappa after an eight-day courtship because of a favorable horoscope (the marriage lasts barely two years). We watch as she navigates the world, often drunk, often lonely, always agitated. </p><p>\n  It must be said that her social anxiety finds odd expression. Upon meeting Sienna Miller, Ms. Blair reports, she grabbed her arm and bit it \"playfully, as if it were an apple.\" Ms. Miller took it well. Not everyone did. When, after a few too many drinks, she nipped Kate Moss's finger, Ms. Moss nipped her right back on the thumb. Hard. </p><p>\n  To her great credit, Ms. Blair puts it all out there. And -- God love her -- she knows she's no picnic: \"When I'm out in public, it's as if my system gets overwhelmed and instantaneously short-circuits. . . . Someone has to really like me in order to be with me.\" That's the challenge for readers, too. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Ms. Kaufman writes about culture for the Journal. </p><p></p>",
