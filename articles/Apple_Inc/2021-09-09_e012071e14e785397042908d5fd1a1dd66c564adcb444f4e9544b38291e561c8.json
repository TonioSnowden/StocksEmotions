  "title": "Sotheby's wins right to sell $600m Harry and Linda Macklowe art collection",
  "text": "<p><strong>Sotheby's has won the drawn-out competition</strong> to sell 65 works valued at more than $600m from the prestigious collection of real estate developer Harry Macklowe and his former wife Linda. The auction house will offer the works across two seasons in New York, starting with a standalone sale on November 15 of 34 works. Artists in this auction span the 20th and 21st centuries and include Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Agnes Martin. Among the priciest works so far are “Le Nez”, a striking sculpture by Alberto Giacometti (cast c1964), and Mark Rothko's eight-foot high “No 7” (1951), each estimated at up to $80m.</p> <p>Sotheby's confirms it has offered a guaranteed price for the whole collection, meaning it will pay out even if works don't sell, though there is time to pass on the risk to third parties. Charles Stewart, chief executive of the auction house, says that the sale “will make history as one of the landmark events defining the art market and the history of Sotheby's over the past 277 years”. Highlights from the collection go on a six-city preview tour starting in New York this week (September 9-12).</p>  <p><strong>Christie's will offer a David Hockney painting</strong> of a private garden for £5m-£7m in London on October 15. “Guest House Garden” (2000) is being sold from the collection of a late unnamed collector who bought it from Galerie Lelong in Paris in 2001. It will be with more than 100 other works from the same collection that go on the block at Christie's in Paris on October 13.</p> <p>Katharine Arnold, co-head of postwar and contemporary art at Christies Europe, describes the Hockney work as marking the artist's return to Europe, having moved to California in 1966. His mother, Laura, died in Yorkshire in 1999, the same year Hockney had a major retrospective at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. “There are the vivid West Coast colours but it isn't totally clear if the garden is in Los Angeles, Yorkshire or London, which makes the painting quite magical,” Arnold says.</p> <p>Hockney will loom large at Art Basel's Unlimited section this month, too. Gray gallery brings his more recent trompe l'oeil, photographic drawing work “Pictures at an Exhibition” (2018), a huge 50-feet long, the gallery confirms.</p>  <p><strong>Art Basel is pulling out all the stops</strong> to keep its 272 registered exhibitors at the fair, which opens to the public on September 24. Since the US authorities tightened restrictions on travellers into the EU and Switzerland at the end of August, the art fair group has faced pressure from its galleries — including calls to cancel the event. This week, Art Basel emailed exhibitors twice in four days to underscore Switzerland's “stable” Covid-19 situation and offer insurances.</p> <p>These include the fair group bearing any hotel and travel-related costs of quarantine, should the need arise. Art Basel has also created a 1.5m Swiss franc ($1.6m) “one-time solidarity fund” for the equivalent of a 10 per cent fee reduction per gallery after the event. This is offered to all, but dealers have been encouraged only to access the fund if necessary, leaving more in the pot for those who do not cover their costs during the fair. </p> <p>Gallerists seem to appreciate the efforts, particularly the quasi-relief-fund idea, but are not entirely comfortable with the backdrop. “[Art Basel] is between a rock and a hard place and doing everything they can. But the problem is, whenever you get an email, you panic,” one exhibitor says. So far, though, confirms director <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e4503e8-aa55-11ea-a766-7c300513fe47\">Marc Spiegler</a>, no gallery has pulled out.&#xa0;</p>  <p><strong>US gallerist Harper Levine is marking</strong> this week's 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center with a show of works in its Manhattan space that were made in the wake of the tragedy by Young-Il Ahn (<em>20 Years After</em>, September 8-October 9). The artist, who died last year, emigrated to Los Angeles from South Korea in 1966 and “was so grateful for the opportunity to be in the US, he needed to make the paintings to deal with his deep grief and sadness after 9/11,” Levine says.</p> <p>The gallery will show six works from Ahn's <em>Memorial</em> series (2001), priced between $100,000 and $220,000. Ahn, who was 86 when he died, found fame late in life for his “Water” series of works, acclaimed for their shimmering and meditative qualities. The <em>Memorial</em> series is darker, Levine says: “You know these are about something heavy.”</p>  <p><strong>Most people enjoy hearing an artist</strong> <strong>talk</strong> about their work and now New York gallerist Sean Kelly and collector Dan Sallick have found a way to bottle the moment. They have devised what they are calling “The Artist Audio Experience”, a way to access a unique, short audio recording through a smartphone as part of the purchase of a work. “Imagine if you could hear Van Gogh talking about his thoughts while painting ‘The Starry Night' or ‘Sunflowers' paintings,” Kelly says.</p> <p>It launches with this week's exhibition of Chicago-based photographer Dawoud Bey at Kelly's New York gallery (September 10-October 23) while two of Bey's works will be offered with their complementary audio file at this week's Armory Show (September 9-12, $35,000 each). The near-field communication technology, through an audio chip elegantly embedded within a glass cube, is the same as that used for Apple or Google Pay. Sallick finds that, for a collector, “it adds a new dimension to what you see and gives a reward for spending time with a work.” I must confess, as I listened to Bey explain the “haunting feeling” behind his “Cabin and Benches” (2019) photograph from the gallery show, it worked a treat.</p>  <p><strong>Credit to the Dallas Art Fair</strong>, one of the businesses in Texas taking a stand in the wake of the implementation of SB8, the state ruling that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16760277-05ab-44cd-aed3-7a4467eb9361\">bans abortions</a> after six weeks. The fair group has committed to donate $50,000 to the reproductive healthcare non-profit Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. “It is time for the cultural and business communities of Texas to band together, express our support for women's rights and push back against draconian measures that are not reflective of our community,”&#xa0;says fair director Kelly Cornell.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Melanie Gerlis 2021 'Sotheby's wins right to sell $600m Harry and Linda Macklowe art collection' FT.com 9 September.
