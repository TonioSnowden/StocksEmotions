  "text": "<p>Panic buying has gripped the Chinese capital as local Covid-19 cases rise and residents brace for a Shanghai-style lockdown. </p> <p>Beijing reported just 41 cases on Saturday and Sunday, but city health officials called the situation “grave” as evidence emerged of days-long community spread of coronavirus. Health officials said the Omicron variant was spreading through different transmission chains and ordered several neighbourhoods to lock down on Monday. </p> <p>Beijing residents emptied supermarket shelves of meat and vegetables and non-perishable foods on Sunday and Monday. Several online grocery delivery apps were also sold out of food. </p> <p>At one grocery store in central Beijing more than 100 people queued to enter the store.</p> <p>“I'm hoarding rationally . . . there's no harm in being prepared,” said Shi Wei, a 32-year-old hospitality worker in the city. </p> <p>“My colleagues in Shanghai learned the lesson the hard way — they are strongly urging I hoard as much as possible, at least a month's worth of supplies,” she said. “Don't count on being lucky, it's better to depend on yourself.”</p> <p>The growing unease spread to markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, where equities sold off sharply on the prospect of widening lockdowns. The benchmark CSI 300 index of mainland-listed stocks closed down 4.9 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 3.7 per cent.</p> <p>Shoppers rushed to hoard supplies after the city's largest district Chaoyang, with a population of 3.5mn, ordered residents to undergo three rounds of Covid-19 testing from Monday. Chaoyang is also Beijing's main commercial area, popular with multinational corporations and home to dozens of embassies.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/9587971.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>It is common for residential compounds where positive cases are found to be quarantined for at least two weeks. Such <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff074b13-2761-40c8-8d53-37917ee101d1\">micro-lockdowns</a> have occurred sporadically in Beijing over recent months. Mass testing, however, suggests that lockdowns will be more widespread, especially if extended to other districts.</p> <p>Xue Ce, a 28-year-old tech worker, was one of dozens who joined a block-long queue at a testing centre in the district. “I'm here because the Chaoyang government has ordered mandatory tests [and] also because there's a surge in cases now so I want to be tested just to be safe,” he said.</p> <p>Across the country, the number of reported Covid-19 cases remained high on Sunday, with Shanghai contributing 19,455 infections to a total of 20,194. The number of confirmed cases in Jiangxi and Heilongjiang provinces grew 10-fold in the past week. Jiangsu, home to Apple's big suppliers, reported 840 cases over the week, the highest weekly toll after Shanghai and Jilin province. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/9588328.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>China's financial hub has endured more than three weeks of a harsh lockdown with no end in sight. Over the weekend, workers in hazmat suits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0ea8d54-fb8f-44b8-8bcd-8f791dd4266b\">installed tall green fences</a> at the bottom of some apartment buildings with a recent history of cases to prevent residents from leaving. </p> <p>The dire situation in Shanghai, where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e439a10-860b-4ae6-9070-ad8546da8850\">food remains scarce</a> and prices have rocketed, has spurred panic buying across China with any rise in local cases. </p> <p>The lockdowns have dented the country's economic prospects since mid-March, when restrictions in Jilin province <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a956cf4b-82a8-4857-a957-0270d41f503d\">were extended to dozens</a> of cities. Shanghai's measures began with targeted quarantines of relatively small areas before being applied to the rest of the city to facilitate mass testing.</p> <p>Despite the chaos and economic hardship stemming from the restrictions, President Xi Jinping has shown no indication of relaxing his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e6914ed-3ce5-4f7f-ab91-ce7b0ad68f2c\">zero-Covid-19 campaign</a>. </p> <p>“We will not waver in pursuing dynamic zero Covid,” Liang Wannian, a Covid-19 government adviser, told state media. “It maximises the safety of people's lives and economic and social development.” </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Nian Liu in Beijing and Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong</em></p><p>Source: Ryan McMorrow in Beijing, Tom Mitchell in Singapore and Andy Lin in Hong Kong 2022 'Beijing gripped by panic buying as Covid cases rise' FT.com 25 April.
