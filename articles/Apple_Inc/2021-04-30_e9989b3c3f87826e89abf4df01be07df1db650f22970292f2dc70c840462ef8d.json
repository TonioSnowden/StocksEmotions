Germany was hardest hit, shrinking 1.7 per cent, while France managed to increase growth by 0.4 per cent, thanks to rises in construction and household consumption. </p> <p>Separate figures showed eurozone inflation rising from 1.3 per cent to 1.6 per cent in April. Unemployment has also improved slightly, albeit with numbers flattered by people who have stopped seeking work or are on government-supported furlough schemes. </p> <p>The overall state of eurozone recovery lags behind the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3250f348-6a58-4a8f-ba79-5556ddfce127\">US</a>, which yesterday recorded growth for the same period of 1.6 per cent, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e45496ec-82ff-4586-a062-20124739fcc1\">China</a>, which this month reported an increase of 0.6 per cent.</p> <p>Today is also, theoretically at least, the deadline for member states to submit their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c974aa4-e20a-4349-8803-b5fc5ec8dd1f\">economic recovery plans</a> for EU approval.

Katharina Utermöhl, an economist at German insurer Allianz said: “The consumer is in the starting blocks and just waiting for the starting gun. Then we'll see a super boom.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/566825b8cb56e60cea589e91/subscribe\"><em>Sign up here</em></a><em> to get Europe Express sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.</em></p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>Joe Biden's stimulus programme, the loosening of lockdown and the rapid pace of coronavirus vaccinations helped the <strong>US economy</strong> record growth of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3250f348-6a58-4a8f-ba79-5556ddfce127\">1.6 per cent </a>in the first quarter — or an annualised 6.4 per cent — enabling the president to proclaim America was “ready for take-off”. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/296ae4e6-5e4e-44fc-8636-67e2ad38eee4\">Federal Reserve</a> chief Jay Powell said on Wednesday that the bank was still “a long way from our goals” as it kept interest rates and bond-buying strategies on hold. <em>Catch up on our series published throughout the week: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6554f268-8114-4adb-b09e-480f2d65543e\"><em><strong>Biden's first 100 days</strong></em></a></p> <p><strong>UK household wealth</strong> reached new heights during the pandemic, according to official data. Rising house prices, which hit a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c8ef5be-4a44-491c-96fd-6927397048c5#post-e23a4f26-50e7-42b2-a27c-7c54194ba025\">new record</a> today, and the improved value of pensions were among the factors driving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e651bff7-8211-4aa6-9b22-4ac968fe6675\">net wealth</a> to £11.4tn or £172,000 per person.&#xa0; </p> <p>The UN said on Friday that the combination of Covid-19 and the military coup risked pushing half the population of <strong>Myanmar</strong>, already one of the poorest countries in Asia, into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63f39c62-c61b-47b4-91ae-3576e21164e3\">poverty</a>. The military seizure of power and its aftermath have also derailed the country's vaccination programme.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>West coast editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42c5f1d6-36e5-4117-b30e-635c85c6a55c\">Richard Waters</a> reports on surging first-quarter profits in <strong>Big Tech</strong> and expectations that the coronavirus-driven boom will last way beyond the pandemic. “Consumers once valued choice, but what they value now is dependability,” said one analyst on how companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c686458c-e544-4c50-990d-954b91d955ed\">Alphabet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2b05040-3164-46f3-8bd5-399e6214ea74\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5042df8-52d4-4527-af1d-5ed70a96b0b5\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/622e0b6c-a288-4d32-b161-10638f9efd9f\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/322f116d-8280-4a95-8392-6f59179d9d91\">Microsoft</a> have become the bedrock of business life.

Moody's rating agency this week forecast “sustained momentum in commodity prices” for the next year.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>The price of<strong> Copper</strong>, a key material for electrical devices and expected to play an important part in the switch to green energy, passed a 10-year high to hit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbd0adc1-442d-4662-bf13-9a641807b378\">$10,000 a tonne</a>. The soaring prices have boosted traders such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5defe2e0-beb1-41ba-aa55-43c3987cc210\">Glencore</a>.</p> <p>A Morgan-Stanley owned fund has won some big bets on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/781997d8-68b0-4b56-bf15-cba7deb6e1c2\">markets staying calm</a> after the frenzy of the pandemic period. The Parametric fund has been dubbed the <strong>“Gamma Hammer”</strong> after the Greek term used to describe how the value of options fluctuates as stocks move. One portfolio manager warned of the dangers of a big move, meaning the trade could “get smoked because you are effectively collecting pennies in front of a steamroller”.</p> <p>Declarations from the Federal Reserve that it was in no rush to wind down its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2dc29002-a101-4ecc-a5d3-bd438bf511bb\">bond-buying programme</a> failed to stop the <strong>global bond rout</strong> resuming after the publication of strong US GDP data.</p> <h2>The essentials</h2> <p>Hopes are rising that <strong>global travel</strong> may soon be able to resume, but finding a common standard for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/332d9774-da3d-4b25-95e8-df5267dc2d48\">“vaccine passports”</a> is a complicated process. FT writers look at international efforts to solve the problem. London's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79ddd832-0ba0-4ab2-86fd-3325bc4b6ac0\">Heathrow airport</a> said it would struggle to cope with coronavirus checks if overseas travel resumed in May. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5408bbf-f640-484b-bf0b-0b5371fa0caf\">Holiday destinations</a> are trying everything from vaccinations on arrival to cash bonuses to lure tourists back. </p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>DeadCat Flounce comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07a6ceac-77cb-43f5-affe-24e6f7629de6?commentID=96f27147-53bc-4f53-9ba7-7564eb1ddb4b\">We're still in the dark about insecure work</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>In the same way that every generation thinks they are the first to discover sex, this generation appears to think it is the first to experience precarious employment. They seem completely unaware of “the lump” in the construction industry or the conditions of dock workers in the past. Instead, they have the impression that everyone in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s was in a ‘job for life' with a final salary pension. That, frankly, is nonsense. I had a job where I worked 48 weeks a year, then was fired for 4 weeks over Christmas, just to be rehired again. The whole thing was done to avoid giving me full employment rights. None of this is acceptable of course — and I welcome this article — but many of the comments below the line appear to think these issues only started in 2008. They certainly did not.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>This weekend's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0255f26-3afe-499d-aef1-69dea5414525\">How to Spend It</a> magazine is a special edition on the theme of hope, guest-edited by designer Jonathan Anderson. It includes film-maker Adam Curtis on optimism in a pessimistic age, favourite pick-me-ups from creatives, and actor Dan Levy on the joy of making playlists.</p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
