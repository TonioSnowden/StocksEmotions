  "text": "<p><strong>St Modwen Properties</strong> has agreed a sweetened takeover offer from Blackstone that values the logistics and housing specialist at £1.3bn.</p> <p>Blackstone made a final all-cash final offer for St Modwen of 560p per share, a premium of about 25 per cent to the closing price the day before the private equity group first went public with its interest. Blackstone had in May <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f2bd481-e6ca-4097-ac08-2b0a7e7b6a3b\">offered to buy St Modwen</a> at 542p&#xa0;a share.</p> <p>St Modwen said it was backing the latest proposal, with Blackstone leaving an option open to making a revised offer if another suitor emerged.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Payments group <strong>Wise </strong>is forging ahead with plans for a landmark direct listing. The fintech, which was last privately valued at $5bn in a secondary share sale last summer, confirmed plans to float on London's standard listing segment by early July. Founders and early investors will retain non-transferable Class B shares holding nine votes apiece. Wise added that it had received more than 60,000 expressions of interest in its customer shareholder programme, OwnWise.</p> <p>Distributor <strong>Bunzl</strong> left revenue guidance unchanged in its half-year update, saying a recovery in the food service and retail sectors has been mainly offset by the decline in larger Covid-19 related orders. First-half underlying revenue will grow 6 per cent versus the 2019 period on an operating margin nearly 1 percentage point higher, it said.</p> <p>Lone Star has conceded defeat in its pursuit of <strong>Senior</strong>, the aerospace engineer. Senior had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cb5f710-1078-42de-b80f-52a64ce3e940\">rejected a £840m takeover offer</a> from the US private equity firm earlier this week, describing it as “highly opportunistic”. Loan Star had pitched its fifth and final proposal at 200p a share, having gone public with its bid at the end of May.</p> <p><strong>Crest Nicholson</strong> reinstated its dividend after swinging into half-year profit. The housebuilder posted a pre-tax profit for the six months ended April of £36.3m against a loss of £51.2m a year earlier. For the full year Crest targeted adjusted profit before tax of at least £100m, which includes a gain from its recent sale of a film studio joint venture.</p> <p><strong>Wood Group</strong> said in a trading update that improving activity and order book expansion underpinned expectations for a return to growth in the second half. The oilfield engineer left full-year guidance unchanged. First-half adjusted ebitda will be down around 12 per cent to between $255m and $265m and revenue will fall 21 per cent to $3.2bn due to Covid disruption, the company said.</p> <p>Online casino operator <strong>888 Holdings</strong> said it had agreed an exclusive partnership to develop Sports Illustrated online sports betting and iGaming products in the US.&#xa0;</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Russia has exacerbated a shortage of <strong>European natural gas supplies</strong> by quietly limiting top-up sales to customers, driving prices to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c023ba5f-4d78-4749-8485-4851baf9ef3a\">a 13-year high</a>. Pipeline exports of natural gas from Russian state-backed monopoly Gazprom to continental Europe have dropped roughly one-fifth in 2021 from pre-pandemic levels, despite a sharp rebound in demand and low stockpiles of the fuel.<br><br><strong>John McAfee</strong>, the cyber security and software entrepreneur, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1bfee838-99f0-46f2-a576-21fde1ac6f34\">found dead</a> in a Spanish prison cell hours after the country's high court ruled he should be extradited to the US on charges of evading millions of dollars in taxes.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hong Kongers queued for hours to buy the final edition of <strong>Apple Daily</strong>, the day after the pro-democracy newspaper shut down following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/099347a7-43de-44c4-94ef-e84b95e7a8c7\">arrests of senior journalists</a> and the government freezing its assets. The tabloid's closure has been viewed as a marker of the deterioration of civic freedoms and Beijing's&#xa0;crackdown on political opposition in the city.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>A victory for the competition regulator over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df4caecf-6092-41b9-a734-cd9c5ce6eaf2#comments-anchor\">English property leaseholds</a> only draws attention to the scale of the problem needing to be fixed, yet political will remains absent.</p> <p><strong>Moira O'Neill</strong> <br>Investors deserve to be told whether fund managers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a3a7697-cda0-4221-a6ac-892f5c78b660\">invest in the funds that they manage</a>. Yet with no relevant regulation in the UK, there's a huge transparency gap for investors. Providing such information is simply good governance.</p> <p><strong>Lex</strong> <br>Brexit has eroded the City's position as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/ee442b39-74e6-4d6b-977f-2a628eb8cbdd\">Europe's financial hub</a>. Reinvention and deregulation have the potential to turn the City into a Singapore-on-Thames or a lawless Dodge City. </p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'St Modwen accepts sweetened £1.3bn Blackstone offer' FT.com 24 June.
