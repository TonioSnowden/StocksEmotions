  "text": "<p>Good evening and welcome back.</p> <p>“The easy part of this uneven global economic recovery appears over,” is the verdict of one prominent economist quoted by FT economics editor Chris Giles in his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1769e10d-9ff6-4c4b-8c7b-0098d321cd29\">outlook for 2022</a>. Another adds that a “Goldilocks” outcome — not too hot and not too cold — is unlikely. </p> <p>The list of potential obstacles on the road to recovery is a long one. The OECD expects global growth to ease from 5.6 per cent in 2021 to 4.5 per cent this year but could this be knocked back further by new variants of coronavirus? What should central banks do about inflation? Can supply chain problems and labour shortages be overcome? Will consumer sentiment recover?</p> <p>Energy prices too are creating growing headaches around the world. In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9dc586f8-5da4-4ff3-b71a-0b88c224a4d3\">Kazakhstan</a>, central Asia's largest economy, the government resigned today amid protests over fuel costs. In the UK, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is talking to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c069f7a-8608-4e92-8d02-df07afac4508\"> energy suppliers</a> about helping households most in need, although Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already warned there is a limit to what the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2986f35c-fb17-4032-a192-869d401a059c\">government could do</a>.</p> <p>Sunak has many other problems on his plate. The FT's annual survey of economists points to a tough year ahead as<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8f45dc9-c93b-4c8c-b5d2-48ebb623a5a6\"> political uncertainty</a> and the effects of Brexit slow recovery, while, in addition to surging energy prices and other costs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/001d12df-4420-4cf2-8198-0cbe3532f6bd\">consumers</a> are set to be hit by tax rises.</p> <p>Across the Atlantic, US President Joe Biden has to contend with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41830ec7-77a7-4754-bc4b-19f62c11dcc6\">multiple crises,</a> including record numbers of new coronavirus infections, legislative problems with his spending proposals and a range of foreign policy headaches. </p> <p>But it is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3972841-6e4f-44df-8ecb-80f169fc7a64\">rise of inflatio</a>n which continues to preoccupy policymakers. </p> <p>If the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve are correct, inflationary pressures will start to subside this year, a view shared by investors, says Rob Armstrong in his list of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/314325ec-822a-4ba4-ae65-3c86213c4c81\">knowns and unknowns</a> for 2022.</p> <p>The big question, says Chris Giles, “is whether the pressure on prices will moderate sufficiently for central banks to avoid taking stiff action to bring inflation down, which could risk stalling the recovery”.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>An estimated 3.7m people in the UK were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab847413-3118-4ba6-b3ab-76300f1e5754#post-da62c19e-8c89-4005-925e-1294a510263c\">infected with Covid-19</a> at the end of December, the highest number of weekly cases recorded in the pandemic</p></li>  <li><p>Ireland is to drop its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/ireland-drop-covid-19-test-requirement-vaccinated-arrivals-media-2022-01-05/\">Covid-19 test requirement</a> for vaccinated arrivals (Reuters)</p></li>  <li><p>HBO said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab847413-3118-4ba6-b3ab-76300f1e5754#post-3b6b3dce-e4b4-4290-9a30-087b327eee06\">subscriber numbers had increased</a> despite an industry slowdown in streaming sign-ups after the pandemic-driven boom</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab847413-3118-4ba6-b3ab-76300f1e5754\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>Opec</strong> and its allies agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2f797d1-980e-41bd-a297-7a782ba2a969\">boost oil output</a> for the seventh consecutive month, a sign of the cartel's increasing confidence that Omicron would not dent demand. </p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p><strong>Coronavirus testing rules</strong> in England will be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02040429-d55d-4557-98da-eb815240f444\">eased next week</a> as capacity runs short and critical public services are hit by staff shortages. Individuals who are asymptomatic and who test positive using a lateral flow kit will be expected to report their result and self-isolate but will not be advised to take a follow-up PCR test. About 1m people in the country are currently isolating.</p> <p><strong>Household borrowing data</strong> for November suggested the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e666a68-6427-4fac-bfb7-255bafe0c547\">UK economy was strengthening</a> before Omicron knocked back recovery hopes.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>The US private sector <strong>added 807,000 jobs</strong> in December, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab847413-3118-4ba6-b3ab-76300f1e5754#post-62737bfd-50a7-4ec5-8111-030736cf1e28\">most in seven months</a>, before Omicron hit.

The company has emerged relatively unscathed from regulatory criticism while diversifying into products such as AirPods and the Apple Watch.</p> <p>Apple tops a select group of companies worth more than $1bn including Tesla and Amazon. Google parent Alphabet and oil group Saudi Aramco are valued at about $2tn, while Microsoft is worth about $2.5tn.

That had boosted managers such as the UK's <strong>Chris Rokos</strong> and partners who made more than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/314ea914-ac14-47e3-95b4-a75b4ff11b64\">£900m in profits</a>.</p> <p>A new round of postponements caused by Omicron has not dented the optimism of <strong>trade show organisers</strong>.

If it was a second or third tier show, it's not recovering.”</p> <p>The rapid spread of the <strong>Omicron variant</strong> in the US has caused chaos in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04b181c2-c980-4e70-9a24-0bc78058ed88\">travel industry</a> and stalled the new year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d31f4c49-f738-4a3f-a832-e8b518f5ca7d\">return to work</a>.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>Capital has enjoyed the whip hand over labour for some 40 years, but there are indications that <strong>worker power</strong>&#xa0;is finally on the rise, says the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b68ece7-76be-4b61-ba94-f1a02b99553f\">FT Editorial Board</a>.
