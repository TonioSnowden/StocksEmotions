  "text": "<p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>This post-apocalyptic movie starring Tom Hanks, out Friday, started as a script for a short film that Craig Luck wrote as a 20-year-old film student in 2009.</p><p>The film is about a man named Finch, who is one of the few humans left on an Earth where encountering high levels of radiation and 150-degree days is the new normal. Finch lives underground with his beloved dog and a highly intelligent robot that he built himself.</p><p>Over the years, as Mr. Luck's script found advocates, the story evolved. Working with screenwriter Ivor Powell, the script became a full-length feature -- expanding into a kind of family road trip across a decimated U.S. Along the way, Emmy-winner Miguel Sapochnik, known for his work on \"Game of Thrones,\" came on board to direct.</p><p>As the script made its way through the Hollywood machine, Mr. Luck says he stayed busy (and fed) working at an Apple store in London and later on film crews at Pinewood Studios. He was on his way to work on the set of the Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly film \"Holmes &amp; Watson\" when he received an email saying that Mr. Hanks wanted to play the title character.</p><p>\"I sat absolutely gobsmacked in my car,\" says Mr. Luck, who now lives in Minnesota and works as a full-time screenwriter. \"It was one of those 'only in your dreams' moments.\"</p><p>New Release: 'The Harder They Fall'</p><p>(Netflix)</p><p>The old American West of Jeymes Samuel's new film, \"The Harder They Fall,\" is filled with fixtures of the genre -- from gunslingers and saloon singers to bank robbers and revenge-seekers. But it is also filled with those rarely seen: the estimated one in four cowboys who were Black, says producer James Lassiter.</p><p>Mr. Samuel's film begins at the dinner table, when a young Nat Love witnesses the murder of his parents at the hand of Rufus Buck (Idris Elba) and his gang. The film continues years later with Love (Jonathan Majors) deep into avenging his parents, with Buck as his final target.</p><p>Although the movie is a work of fiction, Mr. Lassiter says many of the characters are plucked from history and placed in the movie's fictional Redwood City. They include Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz), Cherokee Bill (LaKeith Stanfield) and Bass Reeves (Delroy Lindo).</p><p>\"This is a story told about Black people in this era and their interpersonal relationships, their conflicts,\" says Mr. Lassiter, who counts Shawn Carter (aka Jay-Z) among his production partners on the film. \"This is a story that's about brotherhood and sisterhood and not subservience.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
