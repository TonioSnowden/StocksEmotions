  "text": "<p>This was my year for trying to make myself read more foreign literature. My only option in another language is French, so most recently I read French versions of Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz's \"The Passenger,\" originally published in German as \"Der Reisende,\" and Alberto Ongaro's \"La Partita,\" translated from Italian. The first recounts a day in the life of a Jewish businessman who tries to leave Germany in the immediate aftermath of Kristallnacht. The second takes place in 18th-century Venice, the time of Casanova and Don Giovanni and the other great roués of history. Strangely enough, both books concern the flight of the protagonist from relentless pursuers. Other than these works of fiction, I've been reading history, mostly centered around the Napoleonic wars, in the service of something I'm writing about a real person from that period, Edward \"Fighting\" Nicolls, a British military figure present at the Battle of New Orleans (1815). Nicolls was unusual for his time and profession, an abolitionist with sympathy for aboriginal people, whether in North America, New Zealand or the interesting-sounding places he governed, like the island of Fernando Po. Finally, for a tribute I was appointed to write about the late novelist Ward Just, I've had the pleasure of rereading some of his novels, especially \"Echo House,\" \"American Romantic\" and \"An Unfinished Season.\"</p><p>Ms. Johnson is the author, most recently, of \"Lorna Mott Comes Home,\" a novel.</p><p>Roosevelt Montás</p><p>A friendly warning—Zena Hitz's 2020 book \"Lost in Thought: The Hidden Pleasures of an Intellectual Life\" may draw you into a life of useless learning and asceticism. It may undermine your commitment to self-advancement and sap your resolve to attain wealth and recognition. But if it does, you will be glad, as \"uprooting and drying up parts of ourselves,\" as the life of the mind demands, yields the highest forms of human splendor. You'll be surprised by how compelling Ms. Hitz's vision is. Even if you don't give up your worldly endeavors, you'll probably walk away from this book, as I did, feeling that your inner life has been enlarged. I find the kind of splendor Ms. Hitz cherishes in the eighth-century Chinese poet Tu Fu. I first encountered him in a worn-out copy of Kenneth Rexroth's \"One Hundred Poems From the Chinese.\" It had been abandoned in a college guesthouse where I spent a lonely winter night in 2017. His writing is at once exquisitely lyrical and startlingly direct; it is like looking at the sun. As a reader, it is the kind of revelation I live for.</p><p>Mr. Montás is a senior lecturer in American Studies and English at Columbia University and the author of \"Rescuing Socrates: How the Great Books Changed My Life and Why They Matter for a New Generation.\"</p><p>Who Read What in 2021</p><p>Fifty voices from the worlds of politics, business, sports, literature and the arts share the books that they found essential in an extraordinary year.</p><p>Cynthia Ozick</p><p>Can books conspire, in secret, to meet in cousinly communion? Will like seek out like, as if drawn to a mystical cabal? The reader is an innocent bystander swept up by a magnetic storm of affinity. So here are three books, come upon in three disparate climates of mood and desire: Daniel Mendelsohn's \"Three Rings,\" Dana Gioia's \"Studying With Miss Bishop\" and Jed Perl's \"Authority and Freedom.\" A classicist, a poet, an art critic—have they ever so much as met? No matter; their books do. The anxiety of influence, Harold Bloom's renowned thesis, told us that writers are intimidated by their famous forerunners, and must stumble their way to self-mastery. But the three writers who ended up together on my night table confirm that the authority of prior standards and conventions, rather than threaten or depress, can invigorate. Paintings, Mr. Perl reminds us, are confined within the traditional shape of the rectangle, yet can be inhabited by the inventions of both Leonardo and Matisse. As a student, Mr. Gioia comes under the spell of Robert Fitzgerald, translator of the Odyssey; Elizabeth Bishop, the poet; and John Cheever, master of the short story. He finds in their personalities the rigorous freedom of heritage. Mr. Mendelsohn traces the footprints of the Odyssey as they reveal the secrets of Story, from Calypso's cave to the homeless odysseys of yesterday's Auerbach and Sebald. Three books. One journey.</p><p>Ms. Ozick is the author, most recently, of \"Antiquities,\" a novel.</p><p>Brad Meltzer</p><p>V.E. Schwab's \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" was my favorite book of the year. Period. Addie LaRue doesn't want a boring, ordinary life—she wants more. So she (naturally) makes a deal with the devil, who grants her immortality with this twist: No one remembers her. Ever. It's the cruelest of punishments, especially for our self-obsessed age: Her legacy is gone. She's instantly forgotten by everyone she encounters. Indeed, for 300 years, no one remembers Addie. Until, one day, someone does. It's a bottle-rocket of a moment, but what makes it even better is, well . . . I'm not ruining it for you. So let me just say this: So often, books with high-concept plots are light on character, while books with rich characters have them so busy navel-gazing, they forget about the plot. Ms. Schwab is a master of both. She, like her character, is an artist. Watch how much she gets out of the devil, and Addie's seven freckles, and, well . . . again . . . I'm not ruining it. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" will have you thinking about your own deals with the devil—especially the ones you make every day.</p><p>Mr. Meltzer's novel \"The Lightning Rod\" will be published in March.</p><p>Stephanie Land</p><p>Ever since her essay about being a \"cable guy\" went viral, I eagerly awaited Lauren Hough's \"Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,\" her memoir in essays. I devoured the book in two days—a rare thing for me during pandemic times, when my three children were still home, slogging through remote school. (My husband, an Air Force veteran who wonders if he was at boot camp at the same time as the author, did the same. Our kids were especially feral during that time, I'm sure.) Her voice is sharp and clear, reminiscent of Anthony Bourdain's writing. \"Jobs like we had, you don't call in sick,\" she writes. \"You work. You may infect everyone else, but you f—ing work. A doctor's note won't save you. Not that anyone had insurance.\" Though I haven't lived a life similar to her's, growing up in a cult in poverty, only to escape to extreme poverty, I identified with multiple passages. Her words not only spoke to me, but validated my experience: \"We're all so busy struggling to survive that we don't have time to live.\" In these times, with the focus on the service industry and our country's somewhat forgotten \"essential workers,\" this should be required reading to help us see what we ask of people who work to clean up after us and serve us food.</p><p>Ms. Land is the author of the memoir \"Maid,\" the inspiration for the limited series on Netflix.</p><p>Joseph J. Ellis</p><p>My sense of dissatisfaction with the scatological character of the raging debate about the role of slavery and race in shaping the American narrative prompted me to go back to four classics in the field: \"White Over Black\" by Winthrop Jordan; \"Notes of a Native Son\" by James Baldwin; \"American Slavery, American Freedom\" by Edmund Morgan; and \"The Souls of Black Folk\" by W.E.B. Du Bois. I came away thinking that choosing between the current pro-American or anti-American versions of the story is like choosing between the words and music of American history. Our triumphs and tragedies coexist and interact. As a result, the American narrative is morally irresolvable, always has been and always will be. The same nation that failed to end slavery at the founding also fought the bloodiest war in its history to end slavery based on principles declared at the founding. Our past is both a burden and a beacon. Baldwin is best at providing perspective, reminding us that no nation has ever reached the multiracial goal we are striving to achieve. And we should expect every step forward to generate a racist backlash, as we are witnessing now.</p><p>Mr. Ellis, winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, is the author, most recently, of \"The Cause: The American Revolution and Its Discontents, 1773-1783.\"</p><p>Katie Kitamura</p><p>\"The Copenhagen Trilogy\" by Tove Ditlevsen was the first book I read this year, and nearly 12 months later it remains entirely vivid in my mind. A headlong plunge into the tumultuous life of the acclaimed Danish writer, it is a memoir of extreme immediacy, beautifully translated by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman. \"When We Cease to Understand the World\" by Benjamín Labatut is equally revelatory. Groundbreaking in form, this novel explores science, history, discovery and instills in the reader a sense of awe. Mr. Labatut and his translator, Adrian Nathan West, have a gift for communicating complex ideas with clarity and precision; this is a book of both lucidity and emotional depth. The talented and prolific Mr. West is the translator of another dense and mysterious book I loved this year, \"The Weight of Things\" by Marianne Fritz. Other titles that continue to haunt me include Aysegül Savas's subtle and sublime \"White on White\" and the Jonas Eika short-story collection \"After the Sun,\" translated by Sherilyn Nicolette Hellberg.</p><p>Ms. Kitamura is the author, most recently, of \"Intimacies,\" a novel.</p><p>Joe Posnanski</p><p>Colson Whitehead rekindled something in me in 2021, and for that I will always be grateful. I've always prided myself on being an eclectic reader, flying off repeatedly in unexpected directions, so that when people asked me, \"What are you reading?\" my answer would elicit a response of \"Really? I didn't expect you to say you were reading a lighthearted book on electrodynamics and love.\" But ever since the pandemic began, for reasons unknown, my reading became painfully predictable—mostly nonfiction, a lot of it weighty, some biographies, some crises (averted and otherwise), and even though many of those books were excellent, I must admit that I felt in something of a reading rut. Mr. Whitehead's \"Harlem Shuffle\" pulled me out of it, not only because it's as gorgeously written as all of his books but because it's just so much damn fun. He reminded me just how thrilling it is to lose myself inside a book—and a murder mystery, no less!</p><p>Mr. Posnanski is the author, most recently, of \"The Baseball 100.\"</p><p>Tiphanie Yanique</p><p>Thank God for Alexis Pauline Gumbs's \"Undrowned: Black Feminist Lessons From Marine Mammals.\" The whole concept is something a cynic might dismiss: What could be feminist about marine mammals? Is there really such a thing as undrowning? Is any of this particularly black? And if this book is only offering lessons for black feminists, then the rest of us don't need to bother, right? Except, nah. The book is for everyone who believes or wants to believe that the world is not here to destroy human beings, but to save us; and that humanity may not be designed to destroy the world and ourselves, but that we humans are meant to be in grace with the world and each other. During this second wave of the pandemic, and in the wake of various reckonings about the value of black lives, when I have been so demoralized, so lacking in hope, so miserable that we are still as we are, it has been a saving grace to have Ms. Gumbs tell me, tell all her readers: \"I want to live in love as home, I want to live in it . . . I want to earn the right to say it to you. Love.\"</p><p>Ms. Yanique is the author, most recently, of \"Monster in the Middle,\" a novel.</p><p>Damon Galgut</p><p>I seldom read books when they first appear, but a few especially impressed me this year. \"Burntcoat\" by Sarah Hall is in the vanguard of a new genre of pandemic/lockdown fiction; the book lays bare, in a disquieting dystopia, the connections between isolation and creation. \"Small Things Like These\" by Claire Keegan, on the other hand, casts its gaze backward, to Ireland in 1985; its balance of crystalline language and moral seriousness make it profoundly moving. Colm Tóibín's novel \"The Magician,\" about the complicated life and times of Thomas Mann, is another masterful work from Ireland's own magician. On the nonfiction front, Akash Kapur's \"Better to Have Gone\" is a troubling and moving account of lives gone wrong in the search for an eastern Utopia.</p><p>Mr. Galgut is the author of the novel \"The Promise,\" winner of this year's Booker Prize.</p><p>Eugene Lim</p><p>David Ohle's alternate future is gross but familiar, slimy with phlegm and flocculus ooze. His main avatar, Moldenke, has drifted through this uncanny valley for decades, but in his wry and moving latest novel, \"The Death of a Character,\" Mr. Ohle provides something new: deep insight into the batterings of old age. Another comic genius, Percival Everett, shows how deeply embedded and ongoing is our nation's history of racist murder in his latest, \"The Trees,\" a revenge fantasy gift-wrapped as a hilarious policier. McKenzie Wark's \"Reverse Cowgirl\" is a pre-transition transition memoir—an experimental autobiography that gently weaves beautiful meditations on sex, troubled identity performance and childhood's haunting ghosts. Yongsoo Park's \"Rated R Boy,\" which hauntingly traces an urban Korean-American experience that is vanishing, is an elegant memoir of growing up in Elmhurst, Queens, in the 1980s.</p><p>Mr. Lim is the author, most recently, of \"Search History,\" a novel.</p><p>Francine Prose</p><p>Two of the books that kept me company—and kept me going—this year take place on the border between history and the imagination. Not all that much seemed funny in 2021, but Joshua Cohen's \"The Netanyahus\" had me teary-eyed with laughter. Its rowdy, smart, outrageous takes on academia, religion, Jewish identity and houseguests from hell enrich a comedy of errors set off by a visit from \"a very famous family.\" Beautifully written, eloquently translated from the Spanish by Adrian Nathan West, Benjamín Labatut's \"When We Cease to Understand the World\" starts with an almost entirely factual chapter on (among other things) cyanide, Nazi drugs and chemical warfare, and spins out to imagine the everyday experiences, the inner lives and the personal torments of some of the last century's most important physicists and mathematicians: Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Alexander Grothendieck. The result is a celebration of the glories—and a warning about the perils—of invention, scientific and literary. That both books have proved so hard to summarize, when I've recommended them to friends, seems like a sign of how original they are, how delightfully complex.</p><p>Ms. Prose is the author, most recently, of \"The Vixen,\" a novel.</p><p>Antonia Lloyd-Jones</p><p>I can hear the echo of my own blundering steps through early adult life in \"Fifty Sounds,\" a memoir told with raw honesty by translator Polly Barton, describing the years she spent, as a recent Cambridge graduate, teaching English in Japan. Each of the mini-essays that combine to tell her tale shares its title with a Japanese \"mimetic\"—a compound word that's not just onomatopoeic, but evokes an entire mood. Each of these words grew to have personal associations for Ms. Barton, whose reaction to the language was sensual, as to a passionate love affair. Sent to a school on a remote island, she was thrown in at the deep end, stumbling through a string of linguistic and cultural faux pas that she recounts with irony and courage. Her love of the language has proved deep and enduring enough for her to become an accomplished translator of Japanese literature, but perhaps what she learned most about was herself. This is not just a book for linguists or Orientalists, but a classic rites-of-passage story.</p><p>Ms. Lloyd-Jones is a translator from the Polish. Her recent works include English versions of Stanisław Lem's \"The Truth and Other Stories\" and, with Zosia Krasodomska-Jones, Margo Rejmer's \"Mud Sweeter Than Honey.\"</p><p>Jeanine Basinger</p><p>With movie theaters closed, I read and read. I loved \"The Lincoln Highway\" by Amor Towles, with its cast of oddballs who hop in an old car and drive off in the wrong direction. My kind of people! A friend gave me Candice Millard's \"Destiny of the Republic,\" a book I would have missed otherwise and the kind of gift every good friend should provide. Ms. Millard's book, about the assassination of President James Garfield, is part history, part mystery and fully compelling. I enjoyed Anderson Cooper and Katherine Howe's \"Vanderbilt,\" Jan Eliasberg's \"Hannah's War\" and John le Carré's posthumous \"Silverview,\" featuring \"a former academic of no merit,\" a type with which I am personally familiar. Colm Tóibín's \"The Magician\" imagines the life of Thomas Mann and inspired me to reread Mann's \"Buddenbrooks,\" which was even better than I remembered. The ever-provocative David Thomson's \"A Light in the Dark\" was a movie-book delight, and so was Robert Gottlieb's outstanding portrait \"Garbo.\" In Tom Brokaw's autobiographical \"A Long Way From Home,\" I found unexpected emotional power. Like Mr. Brokaw, I grew up in South Dakota, and I was moved to be reminded that the unrelenting prairie always calls its children home.</p><p>Ms. Basinger is the founder of the film-studies department at Wesleyan University and the author of \"The Movie Musical!\"</p><p>Chris Offutt</p><p>\"The Souvenir Museum\" by Elizabeth McCracken is a collection of short stories that made me laugh and laugh. Ms. McCracken is that rare American writer who is comfortable with the novel and the short story. She loves her characters, despite their flaws and quirks, and it is her love that makes the reader care deeply. \"Rovers\" by Richard Lange is a multi-genre novel set in the southwest and culminating in Las Vegas. A road book in the noir tradition, it's also a family novel, a biker novel and a vampire novel. Mr. Lange is one of our most underappreciated writers. His precise use of language evokes the desert southwest that he clearly knows and loves. \"The Dark Remains\" is a posthumous novel by the great Scottish writer William McIlvanney, completed from outlines and notes by Ian Rankin. Mr. Rankin wisely dispenses with McIlvanney's inimitable style but retains the dark philosophy and moral code of the master. \"The House Uptown\" by Melissa Ginsburg presents a side of contemporary New Orleans that tourists never see. It examines a famed muralist undergoing dementia who must deal with a granddaughter she doesn't know and a misdeed from her own past.</p><p>Mr. Offutt is the author, most recently, of \"The Killing Hills,\" a novel.</p><p>Joan Silber</p><p>Though I missed traveling, lounging around my apartment on the Lower East Side reading suited me surprisingly well. Several favorite authors had novels out this year—I loved Kazuo Ishiguro's \"Klara and the Sun,\" Ha Jin's \"A Song Everlasting,\" Colm Tóibín's \"The Magician\" and most recently Lauren Groff's \"Matrix.\" A novel that had an intense and lasting effect on me was Carolyn Ferrell's \"Dear Miss Metropolitan.\" It's about three young women of color kidnapped in a house in Queens for more than a decade; it's drawn from the actual Ariel Castro case in Cleveland, but the author uses their voices (and others) in a collage of interior spaces and wildly imagined depths. I really did think, when I finished, \"This is a brilliant book.\" The \"victim girls\"—Fern, Gwin and Jesenia—have histories and ambitions and old ardors (for Prince, for Soul Train) and sustaining connections to each other; there's even a section that goes forward to the year 2039. The book reminded me of Colson Whitehead's \"Underground Railroad\" in that the author also uses fantastical elements to talk about spans of experience that have more drama than we can stand.</p><p>Ms. Silber is the author, most recently, of \"Secrets of Happiness,\" a novel.</p><p>Honorée Fanonne Jeffers</p><p>One of the worst legacies of American chattel slavery is the erasure of history: Those who were enslaved weren't considered important except as pieces of property, which means that there aren't extensive written records on African Americans in the pre-Civil War American South. Yet a master historian can take seemingly small moments of the past and make us understand the much larger implications. In \"All That She Carried: The Journey of Ashley's Sack, a Black Family Keepsake,\" renowned scholar Tiya Miles examines the intersections between material and human history by focusing on a burlap sack that was passed down through generations. This plain item wasn't worth any money but held immeasurable value to the African-American family who retained and cherished it. More than the story of the sack and the symbolic love it contained—given by a devoted, enslaved mother whose child is about to be sold away from her—Ms. Miles's book explains (with a light hand) the importance of historical memory, when some in this country still are intent upon erasing black lives.</p><p>Ms. Jeffers is the author, most recently, of \"The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois,\" a novel.</p><p>Michio Kaku</p><p>Perhaps the greatest science-fiction saga of all time, Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" series, is creating waves once again. This multivolume series predicts the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire, and chronicles the heroic exploits of a band of mathematician-engineers devoted to minimizing the chaos and destruction caused by its inevitable collapse. This year, something once considered too ambitious became a reality, as \"Foundation\" was transformed into an Apple TV+ series. Elon Musk has said that the original series, which he read as a child, shaped his vision for the future of humanity as a multiplanet species. The books forced me to change my own outlook on physics. As a child, \"Foundation\" showed me an era 50,000 years in the future, when the known laws of physics, quantum theory and relativity may have to be radically modified. I had to consider the possibility that an entirely new physics might arise out of the ashes of the old. This, in part, has inspired me to work on string theory, which could make possible some of the imaginative space-time devices found in science fiction.</p><p>Mr. Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is the author of \"The God Equation: The Quest for a Theory of Everything.\"</p><p>Amity Shlaes</p><p>There's no free lunch when it comes to free-market books these days. Or much lunch for pay, either. Europeans are veritable Dantes on the subject of the Covid regulatory state. Would someone please publish an English edition of Gilberto Corbellini and Alberto Mingardi's \"La società chiusa in casa: La libertà dei moderni dopo la pandemia\" (\"The Housebound Society: The Liberty of the Moderns After the Pandemic\")? Unusually satisfying is this year's Hayek Prize winner, Thomas Sowell's \"Charter Schools and Their Enemies.\" Don't miss Mr. Sowell's account of the execution—no other term will do—of the soul of the District of Columbia's Dunbar High School by social justice warriors armed with civil-rights laws. Likewise delectable is Paul Matzko's \"The Radio Right.\" Mr. Matzko's account of how Richard Nixon used the Fairness Doctrine to suppress political enemies reminds you what a reptile Nixon could be. Underrated among presidents is Warren G. Harding, an upward revision of whom will shortly be published by Ryan Walters in \"The Jazz Age President.\" For free-market history, indeed any history, older books provide sustenance. Once every few years I return to Russell Kirk's \"Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered,\" a biography that approaches perfection. From their respective graves in Mecosta County and Beaconsfield, the two proffer advice to authors: write up, not down, or even sideways.</p><p>Ms. Shlaes is the author of \"Great Society: A New History.\"</p><p>Ada Ferrer</p><p>Early in the pandemic, I took solace in jigsaw puzzles and long novels. I reread George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\" and Jeffrey Eugenides's \"Middlesex.\" In 2021, amid all the loss, the news, the Zooms, I developed reader's block. Even as I continued to write, I couldn't seem to read much of anything. I broke the spell by turning to genres I did not typically seek out. I read my first graphic novel, Rebecca Hall's \"Wake: The Hidden History of Women-Led Slave Revolts,\" illustrated by Hugo Martínez. It is less a novel than a very personal work of history. The author herself is a character in the book, excavating stories of black women's rebellion as she faces the challenges (and pain) of the research, confronts racism in the present and balances the demands of family and work, all while feeling the pull of the questions that motivated her in the first place. I recently finished \"Boomerang/Bumerán,\" a collection of poems by Achy Obejas which touch on themes of exile, sexuality, aging, violence and more. Daringly written mostly without gender pronouns, the poems discomfit the reader in the best possible way. I've also begun reading short stories again. Perhaps my favorites this year were the ones collected in Lily King's \"Five Tuesdays in Winter,\" perfectly paced, honest, hopeful, with just the right amount of warmth for the beginning of the cold season.</p><p>Ms. Ferrer, a professor of history at New York University, is the author of \"Cuba: An American History.\"</p><p>Erika Fatland</p><p>I'm a slow reader, and therefore a picky one, but I still made some wonderful new discoveries and a couple of exciting rediscoveries in 2021. One of the year's most rewarding reads was \"River Kings: A New History of the Vikings From Scandinavia to the Silk Roads\" by the Norwegian, U.K.-based bio-archaeologist Cat Jarman. Tracing the origins of a carnelian bead found in a Viking grave in Derbyshire, she magically transforms modern archeological detective work into a thriller and simultaneously rewrites the history of the Vikings. It turns out that the Vikings traveled much further east than hitherto believed. Another memorable read was the Norwegian author and linguist Jan Grue's gripping memoir \"I Live a Life Like Yours.\" Mr. Grue was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at the age of 3, and in this book, in beautiful yet unsentimental language, he meditates on what it means to be a human being. Nov. 11 marked 200 years since the birth of the greatest novelist of all time, Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I celebrated the occasion by rereading the Russian giant's arguably most hypnotizing and probably most accessible novel, \"Crime and Punishment,\" and would strongly advise everyone else to do the same.</p><p>Ms. Fatland is the author of \"The Border: A Journey Around Russia Through North Korea, China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Norway and the Northeast Passage.\"</p><p>Who Read What: Writers Share Their Favorite Books of 2021</p>",
