  "text": "<p>The company anticipates that it will see $4 billion to $8 billion in negative impacts related to the constraints in its June quarter, which Maestri added was \"substantially larger\" than what Apple experienced during its March quarter.</p><p>While Apple fell some sting from silicon shortages in the March period, it now faces new challenges brought on by temporary factory closures in China related to COVID-19 outbreaks, Chief Executive Tim Cook noted. He expects that the pressures will impact \"most of the product categories,\" even though some factories have now reopened.</p><p>Shares fell 2% in after-hours trading after originally moving higher on strong results. Apple beat expectations on both earnings and revenue thanks to particular strength in its iPhone and Mac categories.</p><p>The company posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $25 billion, or $1.52 a share, up from $23.6 billion, or $1.40 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts tracked by FactSet were anticipating $1.42 in earnings per share. Apple's revenue rose to $97.3 billion from $89.6 billion, while analysts had been expecting $94.0 billion.</p><p>Apple generated $50.6 billion in revenue from its iPhone business, up from $47.9 billion a year before and ahead of the FactSet consensus, which was for $48.4 billion.</p><p>The company saw $7.6 billion in iPad revenue, down from $7.8 billion a year prior, as well as $10.4 billion in Mac revenue, which was up from $9.1 billion.
