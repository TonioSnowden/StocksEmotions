  "title": "'The Banshees of Inisherin' Leads Golden Globe Nominations With 8 Nods; The dark comedy starring Colin Farrell was nominated for best picture in a comedy. Blockbusters like 'Top Gun: Maverick,' 'Avatar: The Way of Water' were among nominees for best picture in a drama.",
  "text": "<p>On the television side, ABC's \"Abbott Elementary,\" the comedy about life inside a Philadelphia public school, led the pack with five nominations, continuing the success of the comedy series that has been a critical darling since it launched last year. Other critical successes, including the real-life inspired royal drama \"The Crown\" on Netflix and the Steve Martin-Martin Short-Selena Gomez comedy \"Only Murders in the Building\" on Hulu, each received four nominations.</p><p>The announcement of the Golden Globe nominees marks the next step for a scandal-plagued Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which oversees the awards, as it attempts to get back into Hollywood's good graces. NBC pulled the plug on the 2022 telecast amid allegations of corruption, self-dealing and lack of diversity in the HFPA. The network is bringing back the awards show—which typically kicks off awards season—on a one-year trial basis.</p><p>\"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" the story of a single family across multiple universes, also made a strong showing with the second-most nominations—a total of six—including best actress in a motion picture musical or comedy for Michelle Yeoh. The Malaysian actress, 60, who has gone largely unrecognized at awards shows despite a long career, is entering the awards season with momentum.</p><p>Unlike the Oscars, the Globes separates many major awards between the drama and comedy or musical genres.</p><p>\"Babylon,\" the three-hour epic from Damien Chazelle about the seismic shift in Hollywood from silent films to talkies, and \"The Fabelmans,\" Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical film about his childhood discovery of filmmaking, came in third in the movie count with five nods each.</p><p>Two heavy hitter actors, Tom Cruise and Will Smith, were not nominated for \"Top Gun: Maverick\" and \"Emancipation,\" respectively. Mr. Cruise was reported to have returned his Globe statues amid the HFPA controversy. Mr. Smith comes off a rocky year after this year's Oscars when he slapped Chris Rock on the stage and was barred from attending future Oscars ceremonies. \"Emancipation,\" the Apple Original Films title based on the true story of a slave's run for freedom, was shut out entirely.</p><p>Brendan Fraser, who plays an obese English teacher attempting to reconnect with his daughter in \"The Whale,\" was nominated for best performance by an actor in a movie drama, though he has already said he will not attend the event. He has accused an HFPA member of groping him nearly two decades ago, which the now-former member has denied.</p><p>Monday's nominations show that big investments do not necessarily translate into awards power. \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,\" the most expensive show of all timethat cost streaming giant Amazon roughly $715 million, did not receive a single nod.</p><p>And \"House of the Dragon,\" the splashy \"Game of Thrones\" prequel that drew 10 million viewers on its Sunday night premiere over the summer—more than any other new series debut in HBO's history—only received two nominations, though one was for best TV series drama. Still, more niche affairs like \"Hacks,\" the story of an aging comic and her young writer on HBO, and \"Severance,\" the Apple TV+ psychological thriller about office workers, received three nominations each.</p><p>For all the ways in which the Globes have been P.R. savvy—favoring celebrity nominations, allowing booze to flow freely during the telecast, courting buzz with risque hosts like comedian Ricky Gervais—few awards ceremonies have stumbled in the public eye as badly as this one.</p><p>Longstanding complaints about the HFPA came to a head last year when reporting by the Los Angeles Times revealed financial and ethical lapses in the organization. After the association confirmed that not a single Black person was among its 87 members, it now says Black voters comprise 10% of its newly expanded 200-person ranks. The organization's other recent reforms include changing its code of conduct and hiring a chief diversity officer.</p><p>The question remains how robust the celebrity presence will be at the January ceremony. Last year, stars including Mr. Cruise and Scarlett Johansson spoke out against the group amid the controversy. The show was reduced to a series of tweets announcing the winners.</p><p>The best song category offers the Globes a chance to recapture some of that celebrity wattage, with nominees including Taylor Swift for \"Carolina\" in \"Where the Crawdads Sing,\" Rihanna for \"Lift Me Up\" from \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" and Lady Gaga with \"Hold My Hand\" from \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"</p><p>The Globes help set the stage for an awards season that culminates with the Oscars. But instead of airing on a Sunday night, the Globes will be bumped to an unceremonious Tuesday.</p><p>Stand-up comic Jerrod Carmichael will host the 80th Golden Globeson Jan. 10 on NBC. Mr. Carmichael is known for the film \"Neighbors\" and the NBC sitcom \"The Carmichael Show.\"</p><p>Several of TV's buzziest titles received nominations, including \"The White Lotus,\" HBO's social satire about rich people on vacation at a luxury hotel whose second season wrapped up on Sunday night. The show, nominated for best limited series, also saw nods for members of its ensemble cast: Jennifer Coolidge as the messy rich woman Tanya and Aubrey Plaza as the steely lawyer unaccustomed to her husband's new wealth, were nominated for best supporting actress in a miniseries. F. Murray Abraham, who plays the leering voice of an older generation, was nominated for best supporting actor in a miniseries.</p><p>Write to Ellen Gamerman at ellen.gamerman@wsj.com</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Who would you like to see win an award at the Golden Globes this year, and who was overlooked?
