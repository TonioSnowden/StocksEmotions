This means all member states could return to pre-pandemic output levels by the end of next year, following the 6.6 per cent plunge in 2020.</p> <p>The growing optimism was mirrored across the Channel, where fresh <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9441ae74-c573-4892-9d64-4b2393ebbc24\">GDP data</a> showed the UK had proved resilient in weathering the second wave of coronavirus, shrinking just 1.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2021. According to one economist, the country is now on track to reach pre-pandemic output levels before the end of the year. Separate data yesterday showed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d5a290d-088e-4f09-aec2-401a0edbde6b\">consumer spending</a> rising in April as businesses lifted their shutters and inoculated older people began booking summer holidays. </p> <p>Caveats apply. Other data this morning showed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e4a264f-e613-466c-a7fa-28353d15b5f5#post-62b3372f-313f-4905-901c-d507a3581c01\">European manufacturers</a> still struggling to boost production, thanks to supply chain problems and shortages of raw materials. And in the UK, not everyone shares the enthusiasm expressed by the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e328f03-29bb-4ffe-a60a-f7e09596462b\">Bank of England's</a> chief economist. UK exporters are also yet to experience the full effects of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e4a264f-e613-466c-a7fa-28353d15b5f5#post-7790b775-a1a0-4d16-a212-22bfc66d2bc8\">Brexit</a>.</p> <p>Moreover, as political and business leaders told the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a506a1ee-d4f8-49d0-abf4-1c689e355faf\">FT Global Boardroom</a> event last week, vaccine-fuelled economic optimism is not a luxury enjoyed by poorer regions that are still struggling to get their fair share of coronavirus jabs. </p> <p>Richer countries were chided by a scathing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb698a43-0f97-4142-9ff5-15dde66ffae0\">new report</a> today for their lack of leadership in responding to the crisis. That echoed concerns expressed last week by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/836845c1-e313-40b2-bdc0-61a3e244008c\">FT Editorial Board</a> as it urged more fortunate governments to donate surplus doses to the developing world once they had vaccinated their most vulnerable people. “Wrenching pictures from India, Brazil and elsewhere should spur them to do so,” the FT said.</p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p><strong>US inflation</strong> rose at a much higher than expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfffa56a-6450-4a58-97a6-b3d12ea72d9c\">4.2 per cent</a> in April, the highest jump in the headline year-on-year figure since 2008. The leap will heighten fears that government support measures, supply problems and high demand caused by successful vaccination programmes could drive prices much higher in coming months. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98c211f4-f097-4ee6-b9da-593422b6a539\">Federal Reserve</a> officials have been keen to play down potential rises as “transitory”. </p> <p>A jump in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61ca6a81-4126-40d0-aa25-225d67e2b8d3\">producer prices</a> in <strong>China</strong> — another important indicator for global investors — reflects the rise in commodity prices and increasing optimism about the state of the global economy. </p> <p>“Minister of everything” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc0196ce-2192-44ae-9b57-53f0bc725861\">Chrystia Freeland</a> talks to the FT about <strong>Canada's</strong> C$101bn ($82bn) plan to help pandemic-stricken businesses and workers and her hopes for a consumer-led rebound.

Stellar first-quarter reports on both sides of the Atlantic have left analysts scrambling to revise up targets for earnings growth of 50 per cent in the US and up to 90 per cent in Europe. </p> <p>Our <strong>future of retail series</strong> continues with a look at how <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c704482e-ca38-4e5f-b01d-b77c507f0e18\">China</a> is shaping ecommerce with innovative new shopping apps such as OOOOO — “QVC for the TikTok generation”. UK banks, meanwhile, will be monitoring carefully the decision by online marketplace <strong>eBay </strong>to begin offering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7149172d-30c1-4bc7-b5a0-5439a500c285\">loans to business</a>. </p> <p><strong>Tui</strong>, Europe's largest tour operator, said a pick-up in demand for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c987f48-1bb2-4ce0-a623-6574856089ee\">summer holidays</a> this year was “clearly evident”, although it reported a €1.5bn pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of March, sending its shares down in early trading. US and UK <strong>airlines</strong> want a summit prior to June's G7 meeting to discuss the return of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4dbf0a5-7681-4795-b483-acfe1e263c8e#post-532760ab-db92-40e9-96e7-af382d868b1a\">international travel</a>.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>The recent rally in prices of raw materials such as copper and iron ore, alongside agricultural products such as grains and oil seeds, is fuelling talk of a <strong>commodities “supercycle”</strong>. Read our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3650c8f-70a2-4f86-a648-9dc0b4434348\">explainer</a> on how this differs from traditional patterns of boom and bust. <strong>Bulk shipping costs</strong> have shot up in tandem, driven by factors such as China's “insatiable appetite” for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/849434bb-1311-4d89-bc13-3e6c5dc7111a\">iron ore</a>.</p> <p>A worsening <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c7ff27c-919b-4d2b-a820-90fae546323a\">Covid-19 outbreak</a> sent shares tumbling on <strong>Taiwan's</strong> stock market, home to big tech companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's biggest chipmaker, and Apple supplier Foxconn. Strict border controls and quarantine have hitherto helped the country avoid lockdowns and record growth of 3 per cent last year. </p> <p>Losses at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c4ba2c3-ddac-41f5-9f46-7d93c6a5a92a\">Gladstone</a>, one of Europe's top <strong>hedge funds</strong>, are the latest sign of how the sector has struggled to cope with gyrations in global markets as hopes for post-pandemic recovery grow. The fund is the 13th most active short seller in European stocks and has been wrongfooted on several occasions.</p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>AdamC comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0dcaf74-9428-4f64-84f2-41b001e1e311?commentID=712dc616-bcf8-49f2-87a8-2a8e98e81a27\">Flexibility and fellow staff will pull us back to the office</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The office is primarily about bringing people together, in person. So making the new normal work is less about how much time they will spend in the office and more about what tasks they will do. For example, meetings, training and one-on-ones: office. Writing a report: home. This means how much time people will spend in the office should depend on the nature of their work, not some arbitrary split of their time.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>Now we're used to <strong>exercising</strong> at home via video or with high-end kit such as Peloton's networked bikes, what does the future hold for gyms?
