  "text": "<p>Lawn tennis fans are accustomed to rain stopping play. But diamonds? That was the reason Chris Evert gave officials during a US Open match in 1978. The defending champion had played a strenuous rally, during which the clasp on her eternity bracelet of 29 individually set jewels snapped. A search began, the diamonds were duly recovered and the match resumed. When Evert walked off court for her post-match interview, she was asked about the pause, and explained, “Oh, that was my tennis bracelet.”</p> <p>Slender, flexible and unpretentious in its straight-line design, the tennis bracelet has since become a symbol of insouciant glamour. A piece of jewellery that can just as easily accommodate a trip to the supermarket as a martini at The Ritz, the diamond-line bracelet came to prominence in the 1920s, when young women wore it to dance the Charleston. By the 1970s, when Evert did the previously unthinkable and wore her diamonds alongside her sweatbands, it acquired a louche practicality — and, of course, its new nickname.</p> <p>The rebrand saw sales skyrocket as women embraced a radically low-key approach to diamonds. A Tiffany spokesman told the New York Times in 1987: “No one wore diamonds with sports ensembles before the tennis bracelet.” In the 1980s, it became synonymous with status, with women wearing theirs alongside a Piaget or Rolex wristwatch. Some even purchased theirs from Evert herself: the player launched her own line, which she modelled at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</p> <p>Sibling stars Serena and Venus Williams have both adopted Evert's sparkly token of luck on court. But today tennis bracelets are back in the limelight largely thanks to Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who wore Princess Diana's Cartier exemplar for that infamous Oprah interview in March. Even before that, Pavoi's $15 gold-plated zirconia tennis bracelet was making waves on Amazon, with more than 9,300 customer reviews and upwards of 6,400 five-star ratings. “I feel like a princess wearing this,” proffered one buyer.</p> <p>Perhaps that's why the tennis bracelet has proved resolutely pandemic-proof. After all, not much else is making us feel princess-y at the moment. “In the 1980s, the tennis bracelet was definitely an ‘I've made it' piece. But the way we wear our jewellery now feels a little different,” says Jade Lustig, founder of New York-based brand Jade Trau. “It's less about a single statement piece and more about layering pieces that you love and wearing them all the time.” Trau never takes off her own tennis bracelet, made from diamonds her grandfather cut 40 years ago, even if she's “washing dishes or working out . . . I think we all have that Wonder Woman feeling when we wear a gorgeous diamond bracelet, like I could save the world with the power of my bracelets.”</p> <p>Note the “bracelets”, plural — because today's jewellery fan is stacking up styles in what is known in Instagram parlance as an #armparty. Model and photographer Laura Bailey combines a skinny Art Deco band of navy sapphires with a broader, three-diamond-wide bracelet, her Chanel J12 watch and rainbow-beaded bracelets “in the spirit of everyday, stealth glamour”.</p> <p>Los Angeles-based jeweller Jennifer Meyer wears a Cartier tennis bracelet that was given to her many years ago and which hasn't left her wrist since. “It feels like a part of me,” she says. “I wear it stacked with all my other favourites: my Jennifer Meyer turquoise and baguette diamond tennis bracelets, an Apple Watch and bracelets my kids made for me. The more the merrier.”</p> <p>If you'd rather keep things low-key, seek out the slimmer styles. Jade Trau's small Sophisticate Line design is characterised as a “mini tennis bracelet”.</p> <p>Anita Ko's bestselling Hepburn style, in rose gold, is as dainty as its namesake. “Next to rings, a bracelet is the piece of jewellery that we can see most easily on ourselves and admire throughout the day,” Ko says. “That's why I think women love to treat themselves.”</p> <p>As Lorelei Lee in <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em> would put it: “Kissing your hand may make you feel very very good, but a diamond and safire [sic] bracelet lasts forever.”</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Ellie Pithers 2021 'The timeless appeal of the tennis bracelet' FT.com 15 May.
