  "text": "<p>Some actors say their lines and leave. Mahershala Ali is not that type. Living the lives of other people is, he says, a job with a sting in the tail. On a Zoom call from Los Angeles, he recalls a precarious moment. It was 2018. The week before, he had finished shooting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6a26a8a-249d-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf\"><em>Green Book</em></a>, the film in which he played real-life pianist Don Shirley, touring the segregated American South of the early 1960s. (His performance would win an Oscar.) Now, Ali was on the set of TV show <em>True Detective</em>, cast as a taciturn cop investigating a macabre murder. Out of nowhere, he says, he felt scrambled, disorientated — subject to an impact “not dissimilar to boxing”.</p> <p>“Being inside someone else's issues and circumstances more than your own six days a week, and the short days are 12 hours — your mind and body doesn't quite know the difference. It honestly brings you to the point of mental illness.” He gives a short, beaming laugh. “I'm joking. But not.”</p> <p>The comment is striking not least because Ali, 47, projects a particular, deep-seated calm. Casting directors have always picked up on it. It is there too in <em>Swan Song</em>, the thoughtful new sci-fi in which he stars. Both the film — a story of loss and clones, set in the near future — and his character Cameron, a graphic designer, share a quiet composure. (The movie is released by Apple, which suits the MacBook aesthetic.) In both cases, the mood is deceptive. <em>Swan Song</em> was shot last November in Vancouver; Ali says anxiety about Covid and a sense of isolation nagged at cast and crew. The actor also had the emotional freight of playing Cameron, a husband and father who chooses to be replaced by an exact genetic copy of himself without his family's knowledge after diagnosis with a terminal illness.</p> <p>“When your character is that conscious of the ticking clock,” Ali says, “everything is extra vibrant. It all means something. So everything might make you break down. A lot of takes were heavy.” Another laugh.</p> <p><em>Swan Song</em> is set in the future, but also bound up with Ali's past. Cameron's wife Poppy is played by Naomie Harris. The casting reunites the actors five years after the film that changed Ali's life: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/913b27b2-f440-11e6-8758-6876151821a6\"><em>Moonlight</em></a>. For him, the excellence of Harris's work overrode concerns <em>Swan Song</em> might end up in the shadow of the earlier project. (Now a producer as well as an actor, he was involved in her casting.) He also knows the indie movie about a black boyhood in Miami's Liberty City that arrived as if from nowhere to win the 2017 Best Picture Oscar will always mark a plot twist in his story.</p> <p>“You know how they say, once you have a child you don't remember what life was like before? That's <em>Moonlight</em> to me.” The comparison is not made lightly — Ali's daughter was born the week of the 2017 Oscars. “It's not that it feels a long time ago. It's that everything before feels like <em>before</em>.”</p> <p>Ali was already in his 40s — a working actor for almost two decades — when cast by <em>Moonlight</em> director Barry Jenkins. He had found acting in college, having arrived on a basketball scholarship with plans to turn pro. His name would change too. Born Mahershalalhashbaz Gilmore, he took his new surname on converting to Islam in 2000. His forename was shortened to fit the demands of the movie business (and its posters). But while he soon grew busy — the fine grain of his acting and mournful charisma admired by the industry — he also got trapped in supporting roles. For years, he was hired to bring specific flavours to one or two scenes. Ali traces the situation back as far as college: “Even then, I was never the young, heroic lead. I was always the wise one.”</p> <p>At first glance, <em>Moonlight</em> looked like more of the same, a role as an older supporting character with limited screen time. But the film had no one star, and his work was so vivid, he was seen as the breakthrough performer. Fame at last, with all its complications.</p> <p><em>Moonlight</em> became a sensation during — and was part of — seismic change in the film industry. Even Ali's own Oscar for <em>Green Book</em> two years later came amid criticism of that film as dated in its racial politics. For Ali — who describes his personality as “reclusive” — success at this point in the 21st century has meant another adjustment between roles. “Professionally, you go from nobody even knowing what you're doing to people having an opinion on it. And from not being able to get a microphone in front of you to being expected to have profound things to say about real world issues.”</p> <p>Yet even after <em>Moonlight</em>, the lead in a worthwhile movie still never quite materialised. Ali's <em>Green Book</em> Oscar was for Best Supporting Actor (co-star Viggo Mortensen was nominated as Best Actor); <em>True Detective</em> saw him headline, but on TV. Oddly, <em>Swan Song</em> is his first film as undisputed star. He is frank when the subject comes up. (Many actors would feign innocence at having ambitions at all.) </p> <p>“It means a lot. It's hard to address without sounding arrogant, but I've always seen myself as a leading man. And the frustration is decades going by and never getting the opportunity to emulate the actors I love, Daniel Day-Lewis or Denzel Washington.” The way Ali explains it, ego is less involved than a desire for responsibility — a creative seat at the table. “You want to have that dialogue with the director, to shape a movie the way I've witnessed other actors do over and over. So honestly, it feels like ‘Finally.' It feels like a relief.”</p> <p>Becoming a producer has helped. “That's just an outgrowth of having really strong opinions.” Even with the stakes blockbuster high, he says he now has confidence to make his voice heard. Another starring role will be the title character of Marvel's <em>Blade</em>, rebooting the comic book hero once played by Wesley Snipes. “[Marvel] have embraced my feedback. I kid you not.” But producing is about more than securing parts. If <em>Moonlight</em> helped Hollywood reach a place where black actors can now win roles in stories not tied up with race, Ali says that still carries risk without people of colour in the creative process. </p> <p>“When you make work that wasn't necessarily intended for an actor of colour, you can't just say ‘Oh I love Mahershala' or ‘I love Lakeith [Stanfield]' and plug us in. You have to think, well, does that impact wardrobe? The art on the wall? Otherwise, it leaves the actors having to cover for producers who didn't deem it necessary. And the actor gets left holding the bag.”</p> <p>Of course, top billing has a price tag too — time. Making <em>Swan Song</em>, Ali says he was acutely aware of the parallel between his character's separation from his family while his clone prepares to replace him and his own making the movie. Absence too comes with the job. “Yeah, suddenly your child is walking, and you missed it. But life has challenges as well as beauty. And for a child, there is education in that. It's important to see their parents pursuing this thing that they're called to pursue.”</p> <p><em>In UK and US cinemas and on Apple TV Plus from December 17</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Mahershala Ali: ‘I was never the young, heroic lead.
