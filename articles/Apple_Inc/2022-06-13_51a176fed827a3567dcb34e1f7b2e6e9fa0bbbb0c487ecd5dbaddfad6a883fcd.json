  "text": "<p>Hey Fintech Fam!</p> <p>I've asked many of my contacts over the years whether or not technology will lead to concentration or diversification in the finance industry. According to the latest fintech report by the World Bank the answer is of course both. The organisation is predicting a bifurcated “barbell” market with large multi-product providers on one end and niche service providers on the other setting the state for an increasingly complicated financial landscape for regulators to get their arms around. More on that below.</p> <p>This week's issue provides another exclusive first look at the latest global fintech M&amp;A data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, an interview with a proptech firm pivoting amid the tech rout and an analysis what Apple's new financing arm means for the sector.</p> <p>Let us know what fintech predictions you have for the rest of the year at <a href=\"mailto:imani.moise@ft.com\">imani.moise@ft.com</a> and sid.v@ft.com.</p> <h1>Non-banks assert themselves with regulators</h1> <p>Last week was a chaotic one for US financial regulators which are facing mounting pressure to provide more clarity on policies regarding non-traditional banks.</p> <p>On Monday, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City were sued by crypto-bank Custodia for allegedly “refusing” to act on its application for a so-called “master account” for 19 months. If approved, Custodia would become the first speciality digital-asset bank with direct access to central bank funds, lowering its lower operating costs and removing the need to work with an intermediary bank.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill which includes a stipulation that any state-charted depository institution is entitled to a Federal Reserve account regardless of whether the firm is federally-insured or supervised. Though the bill is not expected to pass this year, its passage would likely accelerate the number of non-banks seeking access to federal accounts before regulators create a consistent framework for keeping tabs on the quickly growing sector.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Senator Pat Toomey revealed in a letter that the only non-bank to be given an account to date, B2B payments company Reserve Trust, had its access <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/kansas-city-fed-rescinds-master-account-for-payments-firm-gop-senator-says-11654765201?mod=Searchresults_pos2&amp;page=1\">revoked </a>after a rare public dispute between financial regulators illustrating the current disjointed state of affairs.</p> <p>Strengthening or clarifying policy frameworks is becoming increasingly important as the rise of embedded finance blurs the lines between financial services and other sectors, the World Bank said in a<a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/fintech-and-the-future-of-finance\"> recent report</a>. But regulators may have to choose their battles.</p> <p>“Bringing every other instance of finance and all entities involved in the production of financial services under the financial sector regulatory perimeter would not be viable in most markets,” the report said. “At the same time addressing conduct-related risks might necessitate defining a wider financial sector&#xa0;regulatory and oversight perimeter.”</p> <p>Traditional banks have continued to lobby for more transparency from the Fed since it released a proposal to give non-banks access to federal accounts last year and advocate for increased regulation of non-banks that wish to access the accounts.</p> <p>“Such access can serve as the source of considerable risk to individual Reserve Banks, to the US payments system and its participants, to financial stability and to the effective execution of monetary policy” a coalition of trade organisations said in a recent letter to the board of governors.</p> <p>There are few public examples of non-traditional banks pursuing a federal reserve account but analysis of recent applications by “novel” financial initiations reveal confusion, according to a Yale University study released in March. Most reserve banks do not explain how to apply for an account or what information is required. There is also no consensus on who decides which banks are legally eligible for accounts.</p> <p>The curious case of Reserve Trust “heightens the significant concerns already surrounding the fairness, transparency, and consistency of the Federal Reserve system's approach,” Toomey wrote in a letter to the Fed demanding documentation of the regulator's decision making process. </p> <p>The company initially had its application for an account rejected by the Kansas City Fed in 2017. But, the decision was reversed in 2018 following a phone call from one of the company's board members, former Federal Reserve governor Sarah Raskin. The phone call became public in February during contentious nomination process when President Joe Biden put Raskin up for another position at the central bank and ultimately helped <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89b29784-2ce0-43cb-85e7-c55683826a60\">derail </a>her appointment.</p> <p>The Kansas City Fed responded to the controversy with a statement explaining that conversations between regulators and applicants were common, and that the bank reversed it's decision after Reserve Trust “changed its business model and the Colorado Division of Banking reinterpreted the state's law in a manner that meant it met the definition of a depository.”</p> <p>But the state regulator quickly <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/15/bank-regulator-disputes-kc-fed-claim-about-firm-linked-to-biden-nominee-raskin.html\">disputed</a> the statement, telling CNBC that its analysis of the law is consistent and the Fed's description was a “misinterpretation.”</p> <p>Reserve Trust, which describes itself as a “non-depository Colorado charted trust company,” on its <a href=\"https://www.reservetrust.com/\">website</a>, did not reply to a request for comment.</p> <p>Fintechs eager to lower their own expenses, including Custodia, may point to the Reserve Trust decision as a precedent for getting their applications approved. But for now, the question of which companies should be regulated by financial authorities remains an open one.</p> <h1>Deal Tracker</h1> <h1>Quick Fire Q&amp;A</h1> <p><em>Every week we ask the founders of fast-growing fintechs to introduce themselves and explain what makes them stand out in a crowded industry. Our conversation, lightly edited, appears below.</em></p> <p>Last week I chatted with Pacaso CFO Nina Tran to discuss the market for fractional vacation homes and how the proptech firm is tweaking its strategy to ride out the current fundraising environment. Founded by two former Zillow executives, Pacaso has raised about $230mn from investors including SoftBank to build out a platform that allows consumers to purchase a one-eighth to one-half share of a luxury home maintained by the company. Customers bought more than 400 shares in 2021, which sell for between $240,000 and $2mn*. Roughly half that number of shares was sold in the first quarter of this year alone. Pacaso announced international expansion across Europe last year, but those plans are being revisited, Tran told me.</p> <p><strong>How did Pacaso get started?</strong> Zillow alumni&#xa0;Spencer Rascoff and Austin Allison founded the company in 2020 with a mission to make second-home ownership possible and enjoyable for more people. The old model of owning a whole vacation home is very wasteful and somewhat cost prohibitive. We're offering a better model of home ownership where Pacaso curates luxury homes in top destinations and sells one-eighth to one half ownership options. Pacaso operates the property so the equity owners don't have to worry about paying the bills or maintenance.</p> <p><strong>What's the revenue model?</strong> First we purchase a house, design and furnish it. All those costs go into the sale price and we charge a 12 per cent service fee on top of that. Then, when an owner buys into Pacaso, the owner and the home stay in our ecosystem for life and we earn property management fees, financing fees and brokers fees.</p> <p><strong>How will higher interest rates impact the business?</strong> There is a little bit of impact but nothing concerning for us because a lot of what we do is provide financing to our owners and a lot of our owners are affluent enough to afford a second home so the additional interest rate is immaterial to them.</p> <p><strong>What impact does your business have on the housing market?</strong> The co-ownership model means less competition for single family homes. Since most of our homes are in the luxury market and valued at six to seven times the median price, taking inventory out of the market is not a concern.</p> <p><strong>Have you had to slow your buying because of the current market?</strong> Yea, definitely. Being able to preserve cash for the long term is high priority. We need to be much more mindful of how we spend our money so we are going deeper into our core 40 markets. Now that we're not expanding into multiple markets we don't need expansion headcount in those areas, so we're able to leverage our core teams instead of hiring. We are continuing to buy in markets that are driven by buyer demand.</p> <p><strong>Why can't incumbents replicate your business?</strong> Nothing is preventing them from doing so. It's just that we are creating a new category right now. You can't go to a bank today and get co-ownership financing where there's multiple borrowers within one home, so we provide that. That's one of our competitive moats. We offer up to 70 per cent loan-to-cost at attractive interest rates, and it's interest-only over 10 years.</p> <h1>Fintech fascination</h1> <p><strong>Apple Now, Bank Later</strong> Apple plunged deeper into the realm of financial services when it said it would finance its new Buy Now Pay Later product on its own rather than delegating to a banking partner. Indonesia's biggest start-up GoTo also said last week it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5398536-6dd3-4044-adc9-f2237d3ce4a8\">invest more in BNPL</a>, following other tech companies in south-east Asia. Big tech's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bb641aa-abc4-4a48-bcf1-feac58ffca3e\">entrance into direct consumer</a> lending has implications for<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84a2db6d-5d8d-4a85-a0aa-edf7bc544113\"> fintechs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc4eeb5c-479a-4daf-9f8b-808ee937530f\">large banks</a> due to its distribution power and lighter regulatory framework. The set up will allow Apple to familiarise itself with the mechanics of one of the banking industries core products without a banking licence, and its an indication of its further ambitions in the finance space, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9376ff4f-9e9c-4faf-9a12-5aabfb6cd242\">says Lex.</a></p> <p><strong>Africa reaches out</strong> In a rare example of an African company making a tech acquisition in the US,&#xa0; digital payments company MFS Africa said it would buy &#xa0;Oklahoma-based Global Technology to accelerate its efforts to give millions of unbanked people across the continent access to international ecommerce platforms like Netflix and Amazon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/451c5e77-1c49-47c1-b55e-2e1a81e0597a\">“which are not able or willing”</a> to accept the mobile payment methods that currently dominate the region, CEO Dare Okoudjou tells the FT.</p> <p><strong>No premiums for insurtech </strong>Once high-flying insurance start-ups like Lemonade, Hippo and Root have emerged as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50aca302-1d1d-42d0-a52c-8303fc53a9fb\">biggest casualties</a> of the broader sell off in tech stocks, the FT's Ian Smith writes. Shares in those companies have each fallen between 85 and 90 per cent from their highs. As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7076048c-f066-4750-a364-29bb879ed367\">a refresher</a>, we covered why insurtech has underperformed the broader fintech sector in November.</p> <p>*This has been changed to make it clear that prices start at $240,000 not $600,000 as previously stated.</p><p>Source: Imani Moise 2022 'A chaotic week for regulators' FT.com 13 June.
