  "title": "Didn't Get Taylor Swift Tickets? There's a Few Things You Can Do; Buying tickets in resale markets like TicketNetwork and StubHub could be a costly, whiteknuckle affair",
  "text": "<p>\"This is Beatles-esque,\" said Dennis Arfa, chairman of Artist Group International, a booking agency that handles artists including Billy Joel, Metallica and Rod Stewart. \"We're in unknown territory.\"</p><p>Prices in secondary, or resale, markets like TicketNetwork and StubHub are unusually high and could remain elevated in coming months, music executives said. But waiting to buy is especially risky for Ms. Swift's in-demand tour. A wild card is whether more tickets will enter the market: Ms. Swift may still have some unsold tickets or could even announce another U.S. leg of her tour, executives said. A spokeswoman for Ms. Swift couldn't be reached.</p><p>Demand for Ms. Swift's \"Eras Tour\" is off the charts for what executives call a perfect storm of reasons.</p><p>Her latest album, \"Midnights,\" had the largest opening week for any record in the U.S. in seven years and dominated the entire top 10 of the Billboard singles chart. The 32-year-old singer-songwriter attracted a new generation of young fans when she joined TikTok last year. Plus, she continues to appeal to older listeners with her rustic, indie-folk albums from 2020, \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore,\" effectively broadening her appeal.</p><p>Ms. Swift's 52-date stadium tour, which launches in March, will be her first in five years due to the pandemic. Then there's the \"eras\" theme—a topic of lively conversation among her fans, called Swifties—which could see her revisiting different parts of her career, a possibility helping feed the fan frenzy.</p><p>Ticketmaster said a record 3.5 million fans registered for Verified Fan, a program that aims to ensure tickets go to fans instead of scalpers. Some 1.5 million received special codes to enter a presale last week; the other 2 million were put on a waiting list.</p><p>All told, 2.4 million tickets were sold—including a record 2 million on Ticketmaster on Nov. 15—and a planned sale for the general public was scrapped due to low inventory. Glitches on Ticketmaster and SeatGeek—which sold five of the 52 shows—prompted widespread angst among music fans, who, along with politicians, took aim at Ticketmaster. But many music analysts and executives blame demand—not technology.</p><p>\"It's really just supply-and-demand economics—there are way, way, way too many people who want way, way, way too few Taylor Swift tickets,\" said Bill Werde, director of the Bandier music-business program at Syracuse University and author of the industry newsletter Full Rate No Cap.</p><p>For those still in the market for tickets, here's what you need to know.</p><p>How Many Tickets Are Still Out There?</p><p>Ticketmaster said fewer than 5% of tickets have been sold or posted for resale on the secondary market. But Swifties shouldn't necessarily panic, said TicketNetwork's Sean Burns. \"There is definitely inventory out there,\" he said. Mr. Burns estimates there are roughly 1,000 to 1,500 listings each for most of Ms. Swift's shows.</p><p>StubHub said it has roughly 100,000 tickets for the tour across the U.S., averaging out to under 2,000 per show. In a 70,000-capacity stadium, that's not a lot, said StubHub's head of partnerships Adam Budelli, but it's likely more tickets will become available.</p><p>How Much Will It Cost You?</p><p>Many cheaper seats on TicketNetwork are in the ballpark of $1,000, including fees. Sitting closer to the stage will put you back $2,000 to $5,000.</p><p>The average price for a ticket sold on TicketNetwork for Ms. Swift's Aug. 5 Los Angeles show, for example, was $1,174 as of Nov. 21, according to TicketNetwork. Nosebleed seats far from the stage were upward of $717; the median ticket was $1,500; and the highest-priced one was $25,474 for a floor seat. StubHub said the average price was around $700.</p><p>Concert-ticket prices have soared for years now, but such lofty resale prices could make even some affluent consumers think twice.</p><p>\"The reality is, if you're a Taylor Swift fan and you don't have tickets, and you need to have tickets, the only answer is you're going to be spending a lot of money,\" Mr. Werde said.</p><p>Will Prices Go Down?</p><p>Prices tend to fall in the weeks after sales, and pick up again the last week or two before an event, as ticket supply dwindles.</p><p>\"I certainly recommend monitoring very closely over the next coming weeks here as this could end up being one of the best times to buy,\" said Mr. Budelli.</p><p>But several factors could keep prices high. If nearly all of Ms. Swift's tickets have been sold after last week's presales, that puts a floor on prices, which could rise. Also, Ms. Swift sold her tour right before the holiday-shopping season: Ticket-resellers may demand higher prices on the expectation that some buyers—including parents—are purchasing Christmas gifts.</p><p>Another option for fans is to hold out until prices fall into more affordable territory. Some savvy music fans wait until hours before a show, locking in huge discounts.</p><p>The problem with waiting is there's a risk of losing out on buying tickets altogether given the historic level of demand, Mr. Werde said. It's true that fans could buy out-of-town tickets, but that means travel and incurring even more costs.</p><p>Could There Be More Shows?</p><p>Ms. Swift could relieve some pressure in the market by adding dates. She is unlikely to significantly expand her current U.S. leg given competition for venues and the fact that playing outdoor U.S. stadiums in the winter doesn't make sense, music executives said. But there's nothing stopping her from adding an extra U.S. leg, say, after international dates that are expected to be announced.</p><p>Ms. Swift said last week in response to empty-handed fans that her \"hope is to provide more opportunities for us to all get together and sing these songs.\"</p><p>But even this prospect must reckon with a harsh reality: How much does Ms. Swift want to tour? And how many additional shows would be enough—given Ticketmaster has said it saw enough site traffic to warrant hundreds upon hundreds more shows?</p><p>\"If this was the new iPhone, we'd be making more iPhones to meet the demand. But you can't do that—she's a human being who can only play so many shows,\" said AGI's Mr. Arfa. \"Just because you're a fan doesn't mean you get a ticket.\"</p><p>—Anne Steele contributed to this article</p><p>Didn't Get Taylor Swift Tickets?
