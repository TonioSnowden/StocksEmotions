  "text": "<p>Chinese Estates Holding, a Hong Kong-based property group, has announced an offer to take the business private after its exposure to heavily indebted developer China Evergrande crushed its share price.</p> <p>The company, which is majority-owned by the family of billionaire tycoon Joseph Lau, said late on Wednesday its controlling shareholders would buy out the remaining 25 per cent stake they did not own at HK$4 (US$0.51) a share. Chinese Estates shares leapt 31 per cent in early trading on Thursday.</p> <p>The move to take the company private was another indication of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ffb1250-979b-409f-8f0a-b7fd93185399\">mounting spillover risks</a> from the liquidity crisis at mainland developer Evergrande, in which Chinese Estates had been a significant investor before it began heavily selling out of its position in recent weeks.</p> <p>Evergrande's plight roiled global markets last month after it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7c0f31d-4dff-4992-88e6-a70402b7b4bc\">missed an interest payment</a> on one of its offshore dollar bonds. The Biden administration weighed in on the developer's woes on Wednesday, with secretary of state Antony Blinken saying the US wanted China to “act responsibly” to manage the potential fallout.</p> <p>In the Hong Kong market, Chinese Estates' efforts to limit its exposure signalled that even the closest supporters of Evergrande's chair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9801d522-7d89-469c-98e4-0e25229fcebc\">Hui Ka Yan</a> were losing confidence in the world's most indebted developer. </p> <p>Hui is known to play cards with a group of Hong Kong tycoons, including Lau, whose family has invested in other Evergrande ventures, including its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c4d3394-e4d1-4150-8788-92b754eafea2\">electric vehicle unit</a>.</p> <p>Evergrande has lost more than 80 per cent of its market value this year, and its missed payment raised expectations of one of the biggest restructuring processes in Chinese history. Its shares were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c1bd657-fcb1-4a20-840a-037e319f8be2\">suspended this week</a> ahead of a possible sale of its property services unit as the group rushes to offload assets in a bid to survive. </p> <p>Directors at Chinese Estates were “cautious and concerned about the recent development of China Evergrande Group including certain disclosures made by China Evergrande Group on its liquidity”, the company said in a regulatory filing. It was referring to a report from Evergrande in late August, in which the developer warned it was at risk of default. </p> <p>Chinese Estates shares lost a quarter of their value in early September before rebounding ahead of a trading suspension last week.</p> <p>Chinese Estates, which is run by Chan Hoi-wan, who is Lau's wife and a former reporter at the defunct pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, still has a 4.4 per cent stake in Evergrande but has sold holdings in recent weeks amounting to more than 2 per cent of the company. </p> <p>Both Chan and Lau have also been selling down their personal stakes in the real estate group.</p> <p>The proposed privatisation offer came from Solar Bright, a British Virgin Islands-based company owned by Chan. Lau stepped down as chair of Chinese Estates in 2014 after being convicted of money laundering and bribery in Macau. </p> <p>The company said in a joint announcement that it could take a loss of HK$10.4bn this year on its Evergrande disposals if it sells all of its remaining stake, based on the share price as of the end of September.</p> <p>Fellow Chinese developer Fantasia Group this week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01740d2e-4013-4781-930a-6cb62c8248dc\">defaulted</a> on one of its offshore bonds, adding to concerns for the health of the wider Chinese real estate industry, which is facing pressure from Beijing to reduce leverage.</p><p>Source: Thomas Hale and Primrose Riordan in Hong Kong 2021 'Evergrande shareholder to delist in Hong Kong as contagion hits stock ' FT.com 7 October.
