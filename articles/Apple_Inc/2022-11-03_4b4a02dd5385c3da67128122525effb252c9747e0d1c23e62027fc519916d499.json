  "text": "<p>The San Diego-based company reduced its projection for 5G handset sales this year to as many as 650 million from an earlier forecast of up to 700 million. Earlier in the year it forecast shipments of more than 750 million units.</p><p>Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said the company had implemented a hiring freeze, was planning spending reductions for certain products and could make further cuts to spending as needed.</p><p>\"We're being very disciplined in managing operating expenses,\" he said on a call with analysts.</p><p>The company also said Wednesday that it would supply most of Apple Inc.'s new 5G iPhones next year with so-called modem chips that coordinate communications between phones and cell towers. Qualcomm had earlier assumed it would only supply about 20% of those chips, suggesting Apple's efforts to develop its own modem chips and replace Qualcomm's haven't moved as quickly as expected.</p><p>While phones have been a drag on Qualcomm's business, the company's sales are still rising because it is gaining market share in chips for high-end 5G smartphones and because it is diversifying into other markets, including the automotive sector, which have been more resilient.</p><p>Qualcomm said sales in the most recent quarter rose by 22% to $11.4 billion, above what analysts in a FactSet survey expected. Net profit rose 3% to $2.87 billion, below estimates.</p><p>The company's shares fell about 5% in aftermarket trading.</p><p>Many chip makers are going through a rough patch after profiting handsomely from soaring demand during the pandemic.</p>",
