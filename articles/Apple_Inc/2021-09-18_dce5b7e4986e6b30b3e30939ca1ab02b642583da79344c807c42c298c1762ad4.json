  "text": "<p>Lee Kum Sheung invented oyster sauce, a salty brown condiment that is now a staple in millions of homes, in 1888, when he was a 26-year-old street-food vendor in Hong Kong. He'd left a pot of oysters to simmer for too long, then tasted the brown sticky mess and found, to his surprise, that it was delicious. He began making the burned oyster sauce deliberately and selling it in ceramic jars under the Lee Kum Kee brand.</p><p>His brilliant mistake would make his family richer than he ever could have imagined: In July, when Lee's grandson (Lee Man Tat) died at age 91, the family's wealth was valued at more than $17 billion. And although the Lee Kum Kee brand now sells numerous other sauces, from soy sauce to chili bean paste, oyster sauce remains its most famous product.</p><p>I love stories about iconic dishes invented by accident because they make me feel less despairing about the mishaps that happen in my own kitchen every day. This week alone I have: burned some pine nuts, dropped pieces of egg shell in a cake mix and added too much water to a plum compote (it ended up like plum soup). Sadly, none of these mistakes led to any delicious new inventions (unlike burned oysters, burned pine nuts just taste plain bad).</p><p>But it is comforting to think that just sometimes, culinary triumph can be snatched from the jaws of a muddle. When I fail to add the baking powder in a cake, I remind myself that at the turn of the century, exactly the same mistake may have given us the brownie, when a cook in Bangor, Maine, forgot the baking powder and discovered that she liked the dense texture that resulted. When I let a pan of food burn, I think of the Tatin sisters—creators of the tarte Tatin—who thought they had burned the filling for an apple pie at their hotel in France in the 1880s, only to realize they could rescue the caramelized filling by baking the pastry base on top of the dish of apples instead of underneath and then turning the pie filling-side up on the plate.</p><p>The internet is full of lists celebrating these \"accidental food inventions.\" Without fail, such lists will mention chocolate chip cookies, Popsicles and potato chips, three of the most iconic American snacks. Popsicles supposedly came about in 1905, when Frank Epperson left some sugary soda on his porch overnight with a stirring stick stuck in it, and it froze solid. Potato chips are supposed to have come about at Moon's Lake House in Saratoga Springs in 1853, when a wealthy and demanding customer kept sending back his fried potatoes, asking chef George Crum to make them crisper. In 1930, Ruth Wakefield ran out of baking chocolate for cookies and added a chopped up a bar of chocolate instead. She was amazed to discover that the little pieces of chocolate didn't melt throughout the dough but remained studded at intervals in the cookies. Behold, the chocolate chip cookie!</p><p>Sadly, not all of these culinary legends hold water. Take the potato chip. As Dick Burhans recounts in \"Crunch! A History of the Great American Potato Chip,\" if chef George Crum really did invent chips by accident, it is odd that Mr. Crum's obituary in 1914 made no mention of it. The Crum story didn't start to circulate until the 1930s.</p><p>A likelier inventor of the potato chip is Katie Wicks, another chef at Moon's Lake House. Ms. Wicks's obituary in 1917 credited her as the creator of the potato chip. It is possible that, far from being an accident, Ms. Wicks learned how to make these chips from her brother-in-law, who was a chef at another hotel in Saratoga Springs.</p><p>But even if not every accidental food-creation story is true, such \"eureka\" moments do happen. Food writer Hetty McKinnon—author of \"To Asia, With Love: Everyday Asian Recipes and Stories from the Heart\"—recently forgot to drain a can of chickpeas and ended up making her best-ever hummus. \"It came about purely by accident,\" Ms. McKinnon told me by email. By the time she noticed that she had tipped in the whole can of chickpeas, water and all, it was too late. She pressed ahead, adding the tahini, lemon and garlic. When she turned on her blender, she found that far from being a watery mess, this hummus was \"light, airy, cloudlike.\" The reason is that chickpea water—also known as aquafaba—has amazing emulsifying properties (vegans sometimes use it in place of egg whites). \"Nowadays, even though it isn't traditional, it is the only way I make hummus,\" Ms. McKinnon said. I can confirm that her accidental (and very easy) recipe produces a hummus that is astonishingly whippy and light.</p><p>I am ever more convinced that mistakes in the kitchen should not be seen as anomalies but as an essential part of the cooking process. Most of the delicious things we eat every day came about through someone else's trial and error many years ago. Almost everything fermented, including bread and cheese, must once have been a mistake-turned-good. What is yogurt but rescued spoiled milk?</p><p>One of the greatest advocates of mistakes in the kitchen was the food writer Julia Child. She once tried to cook hamburgers on the David Letterman show, but the burners wouldn't work, and the meat remained stubbornly raw. Unfazed, Ms. Child repurposed the burgers as steak tartare.</p><p>Ms. Child once argued that the art of cooking was really \"one failure after another.\" This was no cause for despair, she said, because making mistakes is \"how you finally learn.\" Not every kitchen accident will make it into the history books, as oyster sauce has done. But learning how to take the burned bits in your stride makes you a better cook.</p><p>The Accidental Chef</p>",
