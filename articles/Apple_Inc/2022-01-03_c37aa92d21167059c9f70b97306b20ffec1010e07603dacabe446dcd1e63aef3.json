  "text": "<p>    Apple Inc. secured the top spot for phone sales in China for a second straight month in November, according to market-research data, driven by the success of the iPhone 13 series. </p><p>   The Cupertino, Calif.-based company had a 23.6% market share in November, according to market research firm Counterpoint Research, after outperforming all other phone makers a month earlier for the first time since 2015. </p><p>   Its nearest rival, Vivo, had a 17.8% market share in November, according to the data. </p><p>   Apple's move to keep prices of this year's iPhone 13 series in line with iPhone 12 models has been a hit with Chinese consumers, who account for about a fifth of total iPhone sales. </p><p>   Promotions during China's Black Friday-like shopping season in November, known as \"Singles Day,\" helped major Chinese e-commerce platforms report record sales. </p><p>   Apple's sales grew 15.5% in November from a month earlier, according to the Counterpoint data. </p><p>   Apple is also benefiting from the troubles of its former biggest local rival in China for the high-end smartphone market, Huawei Technologies Co. Shipments and sales of Huawei's premium models have plummeted since the company was hit by U.S. sanctions last year. </p><p>   However, Apple's top spot in China may be short-lived. </p><p>   Counterpoint analyst Ethan Qi estimated December or January would be a turning point after Chinese iPhone owners finish upgrading their older devices. Mr. Qi said Apple may drop back behind domestic brands like Oppo, Vivo and Honor -- a budget brand previously owned by Huawei -- early in the new year. </p><p></p>",
