  "title": "Samsung Posts Sharp Rise in Quarterly Profit; South Korean tech company's first-quarter results top analyst expectations",
  "text": "<p>Samsung, the world's biggest maker of chips, smartphones and televisions, posted revenue of 77.8 trillion won for the quarter ended March 31. It marks a 19% rise from the year-earlier quarter.</p><p>Samsung said macroeconomic and logistics issues stemming from inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war are expected to persist in the current quarter, raising production costs and damping consumer sentiment. But it expects component shortages that have disrupted the assembly of various tech products to improve, helping prop up demand.</p><p>The Suwon, South Korea-based company is considered an industry bellwether as it is a major electronics maker as well as a component supplier for major tech companies such as Apple Inc. Samsung's first-quarter results topped analyst expectations. The prior quarterly revenue record, of 76.6 trillion won, had been set in the October-December period of last year.</p><p>The performance reflects how semiconductor demand—and prices—generally have remained strong amid continued shortages in the opening months of 2022.</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker, earlier this month reported a 45% jump in net profit in the first quarter. On Wednesday, Qualcomm Inc., best-known for its smartphone chips, reported record quarterly revenue despite a drop in global handset shipments.</p><p>In the first quarter, Samsung's profits were boosted by strong sales of memory chips, its main cash-cow business. Memory prices have stopped rising, a sign that supply is catching up, though remain higher than what they were a year ago. The company expects strong sales of memory chips for servers in data centers to continue, driving profits for the current quarter and the rest of the year.</p><p>The South Korean tech company said its contract chip-making, or foundry, business logged its highest-ever sales for the first quarter and that foundry demand would exceed supply throughout the year. The South Korean tech company's semiconductor operating profit in the first three months of the year rose 152% from the prior year to 8.45 trillion won, while revenues rose 39% to 26.9 trillion won.</p><p>Samsung also dismissed market concerns that its foundry business was facing setbacks in its most cutting-edge process technologies. Its 4-nanometer process, despite initial delays, is currently meeting projected yield targets, while the company is on schedule in stabilizing production of the 3-nanometer process using the next-generation Gate-All-Around transistor technology, said Kang Moon-soo, executive vice president of Samsung's foundry business.</p><p>Samsung's first-quarter earnings were also helped by higher initial demand for its latest Galaxy S22 flagship smartphones, which hit shelves in February. The premium devices bring in the highest margins and are the core drivers of the company's smartphone profits.</p><p>Global demand is 20% higher for the Galaxy S22 series than its predecessor, based on the first six weeks of sales, Samsung recently said. Profits were driven by exceptionally high sales of the Galaxy S22 Ultra, the most premium and priciest model in the series, said Kim Sung-koo, vice president of Samsung's mobile business.</p><p>The company's mobile-and-networks division logged first-quarter operating profit of 3.82 trillion won, a 13% drop from the prior year. But revenue rose 11% to 32.37 trillion won. World-wide smartphone shipments in the first three months of this year were down by 7.6% compared with a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research, a tech-market researcher. Samsung's shipments fell around 4% during the same time frame.</p><p>Write to Jiyoung Sohn at jiyoung.sohn@wsj.com</p><p>Samsung Posts Sharp Rise in Quarterly Profit</p>",
