  "text": "<p>   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker, signaled that the global chip shortage was likely to continue, with tight production capacity for all types of chips it makes. </p><p>   TSMC expects manufacturers to stock up more than usual on chips and other components after recent events disrupted the global supply chain, Chief Executive C.C. Wei said Thursday on a quarterly earnings call. </p><p>   Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as the strict lockdown in Shanghai, a semiconductor production hub, because of a Covid-19 outbreak have served as the latest factors pressuring the global supply chain. </p><p>   TSMC's suppliers are grappling with labor, component and chip constraints due to the pandemic, the company said. That includes its chip-making equipment suppliers, which have had trouble delivering tools to the company since the beginning of this year, Mr. Wei said. The impact appears limited for this year, though the outlook is murky for next year and beyond, he said. </p><p>   The company's production capacity is \"not enough to support our customers,\" he said. </p><p>   TSMC's warnings came even as it forecast revenue to rise by at least nearly 30% this year from 2021 and posted both record quarterly revenue and profit in the first quarter. The company counts Apple Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. among its biggest customers. </p><p>   In the January-March quarter, TSMC posted net profit of 202.73 billion New Taiwan dollars, equivalent to about $7 billion, up 45% from the same period last year, driven by strong demand for chips used in high-performance computers and cars. Its revenue increased 36%. </p><p>   In the high-performance computing sector, which processes data and calculations at high speeds, TSMC's chips are used in central processing units, graphics units and autonomous driving vehicles. This sector is likely to become the biggest contributor to TSMC's revenue this year and beyond, the company said. </p><p>   Demand for automotive chips also remains solid, TSMC said, as auto makers seek to secure chips that can go into their cars, after running short for over a year. Meanwhile, growth is weakening for chips used in consumer electronics such as smartphones and personal computers, TSMC said. </p><p>   TSMC is scheduled to debut its most advanced chip-making technology in the second half of this year, the company said. The first group of customers for that includes Apple and Intel Corp., analysts said. About half of TSMC's revenue comes from leading-edge technology chips, company data showed. </p><p>   Apple and Intel didn't respond to requests for comment. TSMC declined to comment. </p><p>   TSMC said it would keep up with its lavish spending on the most advanced chip technologies. Analysts say that would likely be offset by TSMC's chip-price rise from last year. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Kosaku Narioka contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
