  "text": "<p>   ZVANIVKA, Ukraine -- After a solemn Mass in the Church of the Transformation, the Rev. Marco Fedak retired to a back room to review the latest news on his iPhone. Artillery rattled the church windows, and Ukrainian soldiers in fatigues prayed on hewed wooden church pews. If Ukraine's army retreats, Father Fedak said, he must leave with them. </p><p>   \"I wouldn't live long among the enemy,\" he said. </p><p>   As Russian forces approach Father Fedak's Greek Catholic monastery, a wider ecclesiastical flight is happening in Ukraine. When Russia launched its invasion in February, the ground war was coupled with a spiritual one. </p><p>   In Moscow, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, blessed Russian troops and proclaimed the war in Ukraine a metaphysical conflict between the faithful of God and a decadent West. That has sent officials from other denominations fleeing to the western reaches of the country to escape the fighting. </p><p>   The emigres include Ukraine's Catholics, Protestants and members of Ukraine's own Orthodox Church. Even some clergy of the Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox Church long under Moscow's putative control fled as its leaders in Kyiv denounced the war and declared the church's independence. </p><p>   The geographic shift underscores a broader spiritual schism under way since President Vladimir Putin first seized Crimea and covertly invaded Ukraine's east in 2014. Russia's Orthodox Church has undergirded Mr. Putin's geopolitical ambitions, holding Russia to be a defender of Russia's Christian civilization and therefore justified in seeking control over countries of the former Soviet Union and Russian empire. Patriarch Kirill has called the war a necessary struggle. </p><p>   Critics of the Russian church call it a spiritual land grab. </p><p>   \"For the Russians, the religious sphere matters, and wherever they take territory they want to understand who is important there,\" said Ruslan Khukarchek, founder of a Ukrainian-language Christian newspaper, the Cornerstone. Wherever Russian troops arrive, churches have reported visits from Russia's security services informing them that they need to register their activities or cease meetings, he said. </p><p>   A representative of the Russian Orthodox Church didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   In Mr. Khukarchek's native city of Berdyansk on the Russian-occupied Ukrainian southern coast, most of the pastors of Protestant churches have decamped. Most Ukrainians call themselves Orthodox Christians, but about 20% call themselves Catholic, Protestant or nondenominational, according to a 2018 poll conducted by the Kyiv-based Razumkov Centre. </p><p>   \"There is no place for us in the Russian world,\" said Bishop Sergius Horobtsov of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, which have mostly been overrun by Russian forces. Bishop Horobtsov abandoned his office in March in the city of Mariupol before it fell, slipping through Russian roadblocks by disguising himself as a musician, he said. </p><p>   Inside Russia, the Russian Orthodox Church has helped Mr. Putin cement his power by exalting his rule. He, in turn, has supported the church by crowding out its competitors. In 2016, he signed a sweeping antiterror bill that effectively restricted missionary activities of Protestant and non-Orthodox Christians, many of which the Kremlin regards as sects or tools of Western governments. </p><p>   Since the February invasion, Moscow has taken steps to establish a similar regime in Ukraine but has run into headwinds because of Ukraine's complex religious makeup, Mr. Khukarchek said. </p><p>   Some of the non-Orthodox groups have a history of resisting Russian authority. Catholics are mostly concentrated in western Ukraine, the Razumkov poll said, where Soviets crushed a rebellion in the early 1950s and outlawed the Greek Catholic Church. Mr. Khukarchek said some of the largest Protestant and nondenominational churches sprouted up in areas that during the Soviet Union were traditionally the most secular -- close to the border with Russia. </p><p>   Mr. Putin has mentioned a common Orthodox faith as one justification of his invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many of Ukraine's Orthodox believers have belonged to a Russian-led Orthodox Church, but the country has also been home to an independent, Kyiv-led Orthodox church. </p><p>   After Moscow's invasion, the Russian-led Orthodox Church in Ukraine declared itself fully independent of the Moscow hierarchy. </p><p></p>",
