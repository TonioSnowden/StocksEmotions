  "text": "<p>Ms. Bush's surprising chart climb is the latest example of an old song from pop music's library getting a new lease on life in the streaming era. Recently, Nirvana's \"Something in the Way,\" a deep cut from the band's 1991 album, \"Nevermind,\" exploded unexpectedly on streaming after appearing in the film \"The Batman.\" Meanwhile, older \"catalog\" tracks—whether from decades ago (Fleetwood Mac's \"Dreams\") or just a few years back (Glass Animals' \"Heat Waves\")—are attaining new popularity due to their use in TikTok videos.</p><p>\"Buzz is so much faster now,\" chart analyst and pop critic Chris Molanphy wrote in a recent Slate piece about \"Running Up That Hill.\" \"The digital era has sped up the reactivity of songs to shared cultural moments.\"</p><p>\"Running Up That Hill\" rose from No. 8 the week before. (Harry Styles' \"As It Was\" remains No. 1 for the sixth week.) Ms. Bush's song is also the most popular track on Spotify in the U.S. Pop star Halsey performed it at a festival this past weekend. Ms. Bush could not be reached for comment.</p><p>Such chart moves underscore how much today's music artists are competing with decades of past history like never before—making it harder to get attention and establish sustainable careers. Even the notion of \"new\" music may require reconsideration, industry analysts say. After all, for many younger listeners, \"Running Up That Hill\" and \"Something in the Way\" may be first-time listens.</p><p>The increasing frequency of old songs making waves on the charts is also perplexing for music executives. It can happen somewhat randomly, making hit-making even less of a science than it was before. Moments of chart success can fade quickly. In fact, that a 37-year-old song can rise so high raises questions about the value of music charts themselves, some industry watchers say.</p><p>Ms. Bush broke in the U.K. in 1978 with her self-penned single \"Wuthering Heights,\" which hit No. 1 on the U.K. charts. By the time of her 1985 album \"Hounds of Love,\" which includes \"Running Up That Hill,\" Ms. Bush was acting as her own producer. She developed a reputation as the rare pop experimentalist whose challenging music nevertheless saw considerable commercial success. Her influence extends over generations of pop artists, including Tori Amos, Lorde and Grimes.</p><p>An unlikely hit, \"Running Up That Hill,\" with its driving rhythm, pop hooks and five-minute length, helped turn Ms. Bush—then already a major star in the U.K.—into a bigger presence on the U.S. scene.</p><p>Its revival is the result of Netflix's \"Stranger Things,\" which takes place in the 1980s. In the show's current season, \"Running Up That Hill\" plays an important plot role and recurs across episodes. After the season started streaming on May 27, the song hit No. 1 on iTunes, before taking over streaming services. According to Billboard, it is currently the top-selling and most-streamed song in the U.S. It also has traction on U.S. radio—giving it the broad-based support a song needs to succeed on the charts.</p><p>The return of \"Running Up That Hill\" also speaks to the enduring fascination with 1980s culture—even among those who didn't live through it. In addition to the soundtracks of \"Stranger Things,\" there's a whole subgenre of music—called \"synthwave\"— devoted to the art of re-creating the feel of 1980s songs, TV shows and movies. For years now, pop hit-makers—artists and producers—have drawn on the woozy synths of the '80s to power a string of major hits from The Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" to Mr. Styles' \"As It Was.\"</p><p>\"How utterly brilliant!\" the reclusive Ms. Bush wrote recently on her website. \"It's hard to take in the speed at which this has all been happening since the release of the first part of the 'Stranger Things' new series. So many young people who love the show, discovering the song for the first time.\"</p><p>How 'Stranger Things' Helped Kate Bush Finally Reach the Top 5 of the U.S. Charts</p>",
