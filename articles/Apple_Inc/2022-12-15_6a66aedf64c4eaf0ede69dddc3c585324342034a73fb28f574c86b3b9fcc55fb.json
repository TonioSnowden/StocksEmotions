  "title": "FirstFT: Deep cuts coming to Goldman's bonuses",
  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs is considering shrinking the bonus pool for its more than 3,000 investment bankers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5580a9c7-c7bd-40ba-9212-ea83d4c7aa0b\">by at least 40 per cent this year</a>, as chief executive David Solomon tries to control costs with deeper cuts than many of its Wall Street rivals.</p> <p>The final bonus pools at Goldman are still being decided but the prospect of the deep cuts has fed fears that the bank could face high staff turnover in the new year, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>‚ÄúI think we're going to be worse than the Street,‚Äù one senior Goldman banker said.</p> <p>The cuts, the worst since the 2008 financial crisis, highlight the feast-to-famine nature of Wall Street banking, an industry that just last year paid out career-high bonuses to many employees on the back of record fees from stock market listings and corporate mergers.</p> <p>JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America are all contemplating cutting their investment banking bonus pools by 30 per cent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f774f6d5-3dfd-4879-ac19-8522e0078902\">the Financial Times has previously reported</a>.</p> <p>Goldman's roughly 400 partners are expected to see the biggest cuts to their bonuses. A person close to some of the most productive partners said many top bankers have already started looking for opportunities in private equity and alternative asset managers as they are concerned the cuts will continue.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Fed slows pace of interest rate rises </strong>The US central bank slowed the pace of interest rate rises at its final meeting of the year to a target range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Fed chair Jay Powell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2e1baae-60b3-4719-98ba-e932acb5a285\">welcomed a reduction in headline price growth</a> in the US in October and November but warned ‚Äúit will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path‚Äù.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Reaction:</strong> US economics editor Colby Smith <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7f1d330-e2b5-4177-9060-3eb0f6194198\">gauges the reaction</a> of economists and market participants to the latest decision by the US central bank and its new interest rate projections. Powell's message was ‚Äúalmost a dismissal‚Äù of the recent improvements in inflation, one said.</p></li> </ul> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/12171419.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Elon Musk sells another $3.6bn of Tesla stock</strong> The billionaire has offloaded <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6177c0a-b2a7-4de2-ac18-1a6126054666\">another tranche of Tesla stock</a>, bringing the total value of shares he has sold in the electric car company to almost $23bn since announcing he wanted to buy Twitter. Yesterday Twitter suspended an account that had been sharing publicly available data on the movements of Musk's private jet. Musk, who was overtaken by beauty magnate Bernard Arnault this week as the world's richest man, said the account was putting his family at risk.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Bahamian authorities were tipped off by top Bankman-Fried associate</strong> Ryan Salame, co-chief executive of FTX's Bahamas operating entity, told regulators on the island in the days before FTX collapsed that the now-disgraced founder had likely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/921d0727-4c6e-48fd-a93b-5234940fe620\">funnelled customer money to cover losses at his hedge fund Alameda Research</a>. The previously unreported contact between Salame and the Securities Commission of The Bahamas is the first known instance of a top associate to Bankman-Fried assisting government authorities to bring down an alleged years-long, massive fraud.</p> <p><strong>4. SEC sets out sweeping overhaul of US stock market </strong>The main US markets watchdog has proposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8102fc65-0879-4b88-b3c6-097447a61f7d\">the most sweeping overhaul of stock trading in almost two decades</a> in an effort to improve prices and transparency for small investors. The proposals have the potential to allow stock exchanges to offer share prices in fractions of a penny, as off-exchange dark pools and wholesale traders already do. But the plans led to resistance from market making firms.</p> <p><strong>5. Peru declares state of emergency</strong> Peru's fragile interim government declared a 30-day national state of emergency yesterday in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1036fcfb-f43b-4a82-8d2d-bf8c087646b4\">an attempt to quell violent protests</a> that erupted after former president Pedro Castillo's failed attempt last week to seize extraordinary powers. Troops had already been ordered on Tuesday to take control of airports and key infrastructure after violent demonstrations by angry Castillo supporters led to the death of seven people and the injury of hundreds of others. </p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Monetary policy </strong>The Bank of England and European Central Bank are expected to raise interest rates by 0.5 percentage points at meetings today as central banks on both sides of the Atlantic enter a new phase in the battle against inflation. In Mexico, economists expect policymakers to lift benchmark borrowing costs by 0.5 percentage points to 10.5 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Markets outlook</strong> Contracts tracking Wall Street's benchmark S&amp;P 500 and those tracking the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c12545c-44b1-472a-8139-3863887ff6c6\">lost 0.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively</a> following comments from Jay Powell that inflation would remain a problem for the US central bank well into next year. A measure of the dollar's strength against a basket of six peers gained 0.3 per cent in European trading.</p> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> US retail sales are expected to have fallen by 0.1 per cent during the month of November, according to economists polled by Refinitv, as shoppers began pulling back on spending in earnest as they contended with higher prices going into the holiday season. State unemployment claims are expected to increase to 230,000 for the week ending December 10, unchanged from a week earlier. The Philadelphia branch of the Federal Reserve will also release its latest manufacturing business index reading.</p> <p><strong>Company earnings </strong>Analysts expect software company Adobe to post earnings of $2.48 a share on revenue of $4.53bn in its latest quarter, down from $2.57 a share on revenue of $4.1bn during the same period of 2021.</p> <h1>What else we're reading and listening to</h1> <p><strong>Fall of the house of Sergei Leontiev</strong> He said he was a refugee from Vladimir Putin's autocracy. But why did financial entrepreneur Sergei Leontiev <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60f608b5-ef23-40b2-a931-2eb5d8faf099\">really leave Russia for exile</a> in the US? Accounts from former colleagues, foreign shareholders and experts in Russian finance paint a different picture.</p> <p><strong>üéß Martin Wolf on the economy in 2023 </strong>On this episode of the Behind the Money podcast, the FT's chief economics commentator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/019fcc1b-83a1-4426-83d2-ef26e9ca5c9d\">breaks down the biggest stories of 2022</a> ‚Äî inflation, the war in Ukraine, climate change ‚Äî and how they might impact events in the new year.</p> <p><strong>‚ÄòI feel for the regulators. You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't'</strong> Sheila Bair helped lead the response to the 2008 financial crisis as head of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56d3cd48-0cf7-44aa-9464-356e22b1065e\">interview with the Financial Times</a>, she warns that regulators have never really got to grips with private equity, hedge funds and private lenders, collectively dubbed ‚Äúshadow banks‚Äù.</p> <p><strong>Mobile games market set for decline</strong> The arrival of Apple's App Store in 2008 kick-started more than a decade of growth in the mobile games industry, turning it into a $100bn market. Now, it is set to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/395ebc6d-4b0c-4e66-903d-5b64a95649a3\">fall for the first time</a> since the birth of the smartphone.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/12172011.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>Gene therapies may cure disease, but can we afford them?</strong> Last month US regulators approved the fifth gene therapy targeting rare diseases since 2017, underlining the potential of this new class of medicines to treat and in some instances cure rare diseases, cancers and other conditions. But their growth depends on the willingness of governments, insurers and other healthcare payers in rich countries <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8173d816-1167-4773-bad5-f565fed3ffde\">to cover the cost of treatments</a>. ‚ÄúI think a discussion on affordability is essential,‚Äù one supporter tells the FT.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Plus:</strong> How much does my life cost? FT journalist Claire Bushey reflects on the cost <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cca5f8f-89dd-47c0-9c2a-81bce26d48fd\">of her own cancer treatment</a> and what it tells us about the US healthcare system. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Sport</h1> <p>Reigning champions France are on track to be the first team in six decades <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a213e819-f837-469c-8031-e3e01a7d77e5\">to win back-to-back World Cup titles</a> after beating Morocco 2-0 last night. France will now face Argentina in Sunday's final, pitting Kylian Mbapp√© against his Paris Saint-Germain teammate Lionel Messi.
