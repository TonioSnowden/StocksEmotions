  "text": "<p>Investors cheered earnings from large financial firms, sending stocks higher in recent days after months of falling on fears of rising interest rates and soaring inflation.</p><p>\"We are seeing better-than-feared earnings reports, and Treasury yields are pulling back -- both are positives for the stock market,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial Inc.</p><p>Data released Tuesday morning showed home-price growth slowed sharply, sending bond yields tumbling.</p><p>The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note slid to 4.109% from 4.231% on Monday as bond prices rose, according to Tradeweb. Monday's yield was its highest closing level since 2008. The two-year yield, which is closely tied to central-bank policy expectations, edged lower to 4.477% from 4.498%, retracing a larger move immediately following the housing data.</p><p>Falling long-term yields propelled segments of the stock market most sensitive to interest rates. Shares of utilities and real-estate firms -- that offer high dividends and sometimes compete with bond yields -- gained 2% and 3.9% as of early Tuesday afternoon, respectively.</p><p>That marked the largest one-day gain for the S&amp;P 500 real-estate sector in over two years, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>\"This is a pretty broad-based rally, but clearly the leadership is in rate-sensitive sectors,\" added Mr. Hogan.</p><p>Growth segments of the market also saw gains, as investors place more value on those companies' future earnings when interest rates are lower. Technology and consumer discretionary stocks rose 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Nearly all of the S&amp;P 500 11 sectors were in the green, except shares of energy firms.</p><p>Higher mortgage rates crimped housing demand, denting red-hot home price inflation that has buoyed headline inflation measures.</p><p>Stocks turned higher following the data release because some investors saw the drop in demand as a sign that the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening is reining in inflation.</p><p>Hopes and bets are building that the Fed could be approaching a point at which the central bank feels comfortable easing the pace of interest rate increases.</p><p>Fed officials are expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point next week but are also expected to debate a smaller increase toward the end of the year, offering investors hope that the worst could be behind them.</p><p>A slowdown in the pace of rate increases wouldn't necessarily indicate a shift toward easy monetary policy, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>\"It would be very dangerous for the market to assume a 0.50-point rate increase at the Fed's December meeting is a 'pivot,'\" said Ms. Krosby.</p><p>General Motors offered a positive glimpse into the industrial segment of the economy. Shares of the auto manufacturer rose $1.29, or 3.6%, to $37.01 after reporting earnings that were ahead of forecasts.</p><p>In coming days, Apple, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Amazon.com are due to report.</p><p>Indexes for U.S. listed Chinese stocks are recovering some of Monday's record losses after President Xi Jinping's political-shake-up to kick off his third term. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index rose 4.6% following a 14% drop on Monday.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, gained 0.3% to $93.52 a barrel.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.4%. Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 1.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 2.1%, the Shanghai Composite was up 1.3% and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.9%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.9%.</p>",
