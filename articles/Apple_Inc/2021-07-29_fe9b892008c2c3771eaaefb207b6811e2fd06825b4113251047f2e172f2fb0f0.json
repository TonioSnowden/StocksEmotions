  "title": "Business & Technology: Spotify Enjoys Boost in Advertising Revenue",
  "text": "<p>\"While I'm disappointed that our [user] growth was softer in the last half of Q1 and the first half of Q2, the good news is that we've seen that trend line reverse, and all the leading indicators I'm seeing show that we are back on track,\" Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek said on a call with investors.</p><p>Shares in the Swedish streamer fell 5.7% to $223.32.</p><p>As of the quarter ended June 30, Spotify had 365 million monthly active users, up 22% from a year earlier. The company said that Covid-19 weighed on performance in several markets -- mainly India, Brazil and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Executives also blamed a tough comparison from last year, when user growth outpaced estimates and sign-ups in new markets took off more quickly than expected. Meanwhile, paying subscribers, its most lucrative type of customer, rose 20% to 165 million.</p><p>Average revenue per user (ARPU) for the subscription business in the quarter slipped 3% to 4.29 euros, the equivalent of $5.07, as the company continued to attract new subscribers through discounted plans and charged lower prices in newer markets such as India and Russia. Excluding currency impacts, the company said ARPU was flat. Last fall, Spotify began raising the price of its family plan in several markets. During the previous quarter, it extended rate increases to 25 more markets, including in Europe, Latin America and Canada, before notifying users in the June quarter about price adjustments in another 12 markets, including for the family plan in the U.S. and the U.K.</p><p>Overall revenue from subscriptions rose 17% to 2.06 billion euros. Advertising revenue rocketed 110% to 275 million euros, growing for a fourth consecutive quarter after sliding in the first half of last year amid pandemic headwinds. Advertising, which typically has accounted for around 10% of overall revenue, has become a particular growth area as the company expands its podcast business. During the quarter, it made up nearly 12% of total revenue.</p><p>The company pointed to triple-digit year-over-year gains at existing Spotify studios -- The Ringer, Parcast, Spotify Studios and Gimlet -- and growth from its acquisition of podcast ad firm Megaphone. The company also said the rollout of Spotify Audience Network, which allows advertisers to buy against audiences versus specific shows, helped it triple the podcast inventory it can monetize.</p><p>\"If you looked at us for a long time you would have said Spotify is a paid-subscriptions business in music and ads is a sideline business. We're now finally seeing the ad-supported side break out and become a significant revenue driver for the firm,\" Mr. Ek said. \"I've said all future media companies are going to need multiple revenue models, and from a future strategy perspective this is incredibly great news for us.\"</p><p>He pointed to the large ad market in radio -- some $20 billion in the U.S. and $50 billion globally. Spotify now has 2.9 million podcasts available on its service, up from 2.6 million in the prior quarter.</p><p>The company said that the Joe Rogan Experience, which is exclusively available on Spotify, continues to outperform expectations, and that Ringer shows including the Bill Simmons Podcast helped increase consumption significantly around the NBA playoffs.</p><p>Facing increasing competition in podcasts from rivals including Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., Spotify introduced a platform for podcasters to charge a subscription fee. The company said it won't charge for use of the platform, nor collect any portion of podcasters' subscription revenues for the first two years.</p><p>Overall for the second quarter, revenue climbed 23% to 2.33 billion euros, in line with the company's expectations.</p><p>Spotify posted a loss of 20 million euros or 19 European cents a share, compared with a loss of 356 million euros, or 1.91 euros a share, in the year-earlier period. For the third quarter, Spotify said it expects to generate revenue of 2.31 billion euros to 2.51 billion euros.</p>",
