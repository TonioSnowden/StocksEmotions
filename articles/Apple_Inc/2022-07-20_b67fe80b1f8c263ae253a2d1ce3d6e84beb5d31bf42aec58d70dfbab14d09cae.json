A final approval from the presiding judge is still required.</p><p>The settlement covers certain MacBook models from 2015 to 2019. It also provides four years of protection for future keyboard issues.</p><p>Certain groups in the settlement are estimated to receive between $50 and $395 depending on the number of valid claims received.</p><p>The butterfly keyboard is the flatter keyboard found on previous MacBook renditions.
