  "text": "<p>Hackers have been feasting on the vulnerability found this month in software running on millions of servers around the world, with more than 1.2m attacks on companies globally since last Friday, according to researchers.</p> <p>Cyber security group Check Point said the attacks, relating to the Log4j open-source software library for logging data in Java-based applications, had accelerated, with its researchers seeing more than 100 attacks a minute at some points, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3c244f2-eaba-4c46-9a51-b28fc13d9551\">reports Hannah Murphy.</a> </p> <p>Perpetrators include “Chinese government attackers”, according to Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer of cyber company Mandiant. The flaw in Log4j allows attackers to gain remote control over computers running apps in Java. </p> <p>Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told industry executives that the vulnerability was “one of the most serious I've seen in my entire career, if not the most serious”, according to US media reports. Hundreds of millions of devices are likely to be affected, she said. </p> <p><em><strong>Your views:</strong></em> A number of readers responded to my coverage of Log4j in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b001d9f-c7b0-41bc-aa14-d7cf90a3dfee\">yesterday's newsletter.,</a> mainly defending the role of open source software in computer networks. I had linked to <a href=\"https://blog.filippo.io/professional-maintainers/\">this article</a> arguing there needed to be a professionalising of the role of maintaining such software, which was often carried out by volunteers in their spare time. <strong>Damon Lynch</strong>, an open source developer, objected to the headline, suggesting “Poorly supported code opens doors for hackers” was a fairer reflection of what was being said. <strong>Daniel Probst</strong> emailed: “While I agree that free riding on un(der) paid developers is a problem with many open source projects and can lead to security problems, IMHO the majority of grave security problems stem from closed source software not open source. Where was your post ‘1000s of closed source Microsoft Exchange servers actively compromised'?”</p> <p><strong>Dennis Gerson</strong>, an IBM veteran, &#xa0;said: “It is a failure of the various Software Foundation Community processes that lead to well known ‘bugs' never getting fixed . . . As we all know, there is no ‘free lunch'.&#xa0; We traded high price, high acquisition and support cost proprietary technologies for free acquisition prices, low support cost Open Source technologies. The not so hidden price we all pay is exposure to long known bugs through hacks and lack of accountability in resolving bugs.” </p> <p>Thank you for your comments.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1.

One hub can service about 600 people. Much of the company's work has been undertaken in India and Bangladesh. </p> <p>Its latest project — a joint effort with the non-profit TechFugees — is using the hubs to deliver power and access to information to refugee camps in Kenya and Uganda. It wants to roll out this “Knowledge is Freedom” campaign to displaced communities across Africa and the Middle East. The goal? To help over one million refugees.
