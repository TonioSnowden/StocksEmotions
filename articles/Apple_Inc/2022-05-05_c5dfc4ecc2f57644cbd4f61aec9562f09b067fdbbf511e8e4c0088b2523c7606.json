  "text": "<p>Specifically, Meta will be halting, or in some cases slowing, hiring for more mid- to senior-level positions, according to the company. This follows a recent pause on hiring early-career engineers a few weeks back.</p><p>Like other tech giants, Meta has been a hiring juggernaut in recent years, more than doubling the size of its workforce since 2018.</p><p>At the end of the first quarter, Meta counted 77,800 full-time employees, up 28% from a year earlier, according to the company's most recent quarterly report.</p><p>The company doesn't have any plans for layoffs at this time, it said. Meta overshot some of its hiring goals -- it hired more people in the first quarter of 2022 than it did in all of 2021 -- and it is adjusting accordingly, the company said.</p><p>The shift in hiring strategy comes after a string of disappointing quarters for the social-media company.</p><p>Last week, the company posted its slowest revenue growth since going public a decade ago as it navigates growing competition from the likes of TikTok and privacy headwinds for its advertising business. In February, the company said it estimated that ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple Inc. last year would cost it some $10 billion this year.</p><p>The company also cited the Ukraine conflict and broader macroeconomic conditions as factors for the slowdown.</p><p>The hiring strategy shift was earlier reported by Business Insider.</p><p>Meta shares climbed on the news, gaining more than 5% Wednesday.</p><p>Since February, the company's shares have dropped more than 30%. That is equivalent to a loss of $274.6 billion in market value.</p>",
