  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Xiaomi Chief Gives  Shares to Charity  ----  By Yifan Wang",
  "text": "<p>   The chairman of smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. has given company shares worth more than $2 billion to charity, in the latest huge donation by a Chinese mogul as Beijing deepens its crackdown on the country's tech sector. </p><p>   Xiaomi -- which overtook Apple Inc. as the world's second-biggest smartphone vendor in the second quarter, according to Canalys -- is seen by analysts as less of a priority for Chinese regulators than China's online giants, given its focus on hardware manufacturing. </p><p>   But with the handout, billionaire Lei Jun, who is also the company's founder and chief executive, is following gifts made by leaders at some of the country's biggest internet companies. </p><p>   Mr. Lei has transferred about 616 million shares to two charitable foundations co-founded by him, stock-exchange filings late Friday showed. Based on that day's closing stock price of 28.25 Hong Kong dollars, or the equivalent of about $3.64, the donation was valued at about $2.2 billion. After the transaction, he holds a 10.6% stake in Xiaomi, one of the filings showed. </p><p>   Last month, Wang Xing, founder of delivery giant Meituan, gave away more than $2 billion worth of shares to his charitable foundation. In the same month, ByteDance Ltd. founder Zhang Yiming made a gift of about $77 million to set up an educational fund in his hometown, according to the local education bureau. ByteDance owns the short-video app TikTok. </p><p>   Last year, Pinduoduo Inc. founder Colin Huang and his founding team donated a 2.37% stake in their company to a vehicle called the Starry Night Foundation, which has pledged to donate $100 million over the coming years to a Chinese university. </p><p>   \"It's one of the objectives of the government to make sure that private companies are not getting too big and too powerful,\" which may exacerbate the rich-and-poor divide in China, said Jefferies analyst Edison Lee. \"The donations would help narrow the wealth gap, so that would be aligning with the government's objective.\" </p><p></p>",
