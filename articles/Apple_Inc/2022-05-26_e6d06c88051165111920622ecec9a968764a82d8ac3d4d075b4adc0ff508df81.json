  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Are foreign companies giving up on China? </p><p>\n  They are certainly sounding a grumpy note: an April survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China found that 23% of respondents were considering shifting current or planned investments in China to other markets, the highest total in the past decade. </p><p>\n  Apple, whose suppliers in China constitute the country's largest source of private-sector employment, is pushing its contractors to do more manufacturing elsewhere. Even before the latest Omicron wave hit Shanghai, over a third of American companies told the American Chamber of Commerce this spring that they would reduce investment in the country due to the policy environment there. </p><p>\n  Foreign heavyweights such as Apple have invested so much in Chinathat there is little prospect of a mass exodus. But the stars are aligning for a more concerted effort by large manufacturers to diversify away from the country. Besides slower growth for China itself, the consequences could include further yuan weakness and a higher profile for more growth-oriented Chinese leaders such as Premier Li Keqiang. </p><p>\n   The country's strict anti-Covid-19 policies, which left most of Shanghai in lockdown for much of the past two months, is a main reason. Add in Beijing's tacit support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the broad damage to China's domestic economy from last year's crackdowns on the key property and technology sectors, and Beijing's policy mix begins to look toxic for foreign companies. </p><p>\n  While a surge of foreign investment into China in 2020 and 2021 looked at odds with the dive in overall relations between Beijing and Western capitals, in retrospect it isn't difficult to explain: China, and Chinese exports, were booming while the rest of the world was flat on its back. And while export competitiveness certainly isn't the only factor for overseas investment in China, it undoubtedly is a critical one. Over the past two decades the overall trends between China's export growth and foreign direct investment line up very well. </p><p>\n  Now, China's export growth has taken a steep dive thanks to a combination of Covid-19 lockdowns, weakening overseas demand and, most likely, tougher competition from other low-cost manufacturers that were closed last year. </p><p>\n  Exports may rebound temporarily should Shanghai get fully back on its feet. But most of these factors are likely to persist for a while. </p><p>\n  There will inevitably be more disruptive lockdowns in China given the very low probability of a significant move away from the \"zero-Covid\" policy until early 2023 at the earliest. And while alternative production locations such as Southeast Asia and India all present their own difficulties, they also have some distinct advantages, including growing, youthful labor forces -- and governments that aren't positioning themselves as ideological and, potentially, military opponents of developed democracies. </p><p>\n  Perhaps most important, Beijing's strident attack on some of its own most successful private companies, combined with its rigid approach to Covid-19 have severely impacted Chinese consumers and the labor market for young graduates. This raises serious questions about the growth of the domestic market and the stability of the policy environment for business. Perhaps coming personnel changes at the 20th Party Congress this autumn will signal the start of a course correction. Regardless, it will take more than a few speeches from Mr. Li to convince foreign businesses that China is still the country of the future. </p><p></p>",
