  "title": "The 2022 Toyota Tundra goes big on power, with a hybrid version and giant grill",
  "text": "<p>Here's a look at the numbers:</p><p>The base 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 puts out 389 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque.</p><p>Thanks to a motor-generator squeezed between the V6 and the 10-speed automatic transmission, the hybrid boasts 437 hp and 583 lb-ft of torque.</p><p>Those latter figures top the hybrid Ford F-150 PowerBoost's 430 hp and 570 lb-ft of torque.</p><p>ToyotaThe hybrid version of the 2022 Tundra can drive on electricity alone in city situations thanks to its 288-volt nickel-metal hydride battery pack tucked under the rear seat. Otherwise, the electric motor supplements the V8 primarily at lower speeds and under hard acceleration.</p><p>Also read:Americans' love affair with pickup trucks might be derailing their retirement plans</p><p>Toyota provided no hints about the new Tundra's fuel economy. The outgoing model is rated between 14 and 15 mpg combined.</p><p>Toyota says that the Tundra's tow rating will max out at 12,000 pounds.</p><p>Underneath, the Tundra retains conventional body-on-frame construction but follows the Ram 1500's lead in switching from leaf to coil springs for the rear axle in an effort to improve ride quality and off-road articulation.</p><p>Looking the part</p><p>Beyond the front grille, the new Tundra wears complex headlights that carve into the front fenders. Wheel arch trim rests over big openings that house alloy wheels painted silver or black, depending on the grade. Black trim on the A-pillars gives the Tundra's roof a “helmet” look. The contoured bed gives way to a small ducktail-like spoiler integrated into the tailgate.</p><p>ToyotaExtended- and crew-cab versions return, with a choice of 6.5- or 8.1-foot beds with the extended cab and 5.5- or 6.5-foot beds with the crew cab.</p><p>Inside, the new dash is dominated by an optional 14-inch touchscreen lingering above a strip of climate controls. Toggle-style switches sit below. Trim finishes range the gamut, from cloth seats on SR5 to various shades and patterns of leather.</p><p>The touchscreen holds a new infotainment system with “Hey, Toyota” voice commands and over-the-air updates for its software and available navigation maps. Wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility are included, too. Various collision-avoidance features such as automatic emergency braking, active lane control, and adaptive cruise control are standard, though Toyota has not made mention of a hands-free system like Ford's F BlueCruise or Chevrolet and GMC's Super Cruise.</p><p>Also see:The 11 best features of the Hummer EV</p><p>The new Tundra goes on sale later this year in SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, 1794, and TRD Pro trim levels, though Toyota has not said how much the new truck will cost. A TRD Off-Road package adds a specially-tuned suspension and a locking rear differential (4-wheel-drive versions only), while a TRD Sport package goes in the opposite direction with 20-inch alloy wheels and a lowered suspension.&#xa0;</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;Autotrader.com.</p>",
