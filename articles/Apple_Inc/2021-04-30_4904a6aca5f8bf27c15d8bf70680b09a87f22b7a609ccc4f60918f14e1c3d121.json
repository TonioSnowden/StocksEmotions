  "title": "Amazon's  Profit  More Than  Triples  ----  By Sebastian Herrera",
  "text": "<p>   Amazon.com Inc. reported record quarterly profit as demand remained robust for its deliveries, cloud-computing and advertising businesses, capping a blockbuster earnings season for the world's largest technology companies. </p><p>   The Seattle company's profit in the year since the pandemic started exceeded $26 billion, more than the previous three years combined. Net income from January to March more than tripled to $8.1 billion, and revenue of $108 billion far exceeded the average of analyst estimates on FactSet. </p><p>   Amazon said it expects sales from April to June to reach between $110 billion and $116 billion, which would mark three consecutive quarters with more than $100 billion in revenue. The company's shares rose about 3.5% in after-hour trading Thursday. </p><p>   The tech giant's success in the past year has catapulted the company to new heights, after consumers flocked to online shopping during pandemic lockdowns. Amazon's dominant grip over e-commerce and continued expansion into new industries have strengthened its power, although the company continues to face challenges from regulators and some employees. </p><p>   Amazon, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Google and Microsoft Corp. all reported significant gains in profits and revenue, underscoring how the pandemic helped strengthen tech companies and put them increasingly at the center of daily life. </p><p>   Apple's profit more than doubled to $23.6 billion due to higher sales of new, higher-priced iPhones as well as Mac computers and iPads. A surge in digital-ad spending lifted Facebook and Google parent Alphabet Inc., while Microsoft posted a 19% increase in quarterly sales as more customers turned to its cloud and videogame services while staying home during lockdowns. </p><p>   Amazon's first quarter is typically slower than its preceding end-of-year results, which are aided by holiday shopping sales. Yet the company exceeded expectations in recent quarters. It shattered sales records last year as the homebound turned to its delivery services. </p><p>   The company's stock price rose 76% in 2020. </p><p>   Amazon said Thursday it expects its annual Prime Day shopping extravaganza to occur in June. The event, which is typically held in July, the third quarter, is a windfall for sales. </p><p>   Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Amazon is focused on building out its one-day shopping service and continues to zero in on employee hiring and expanding warehouse capacity. \"The economy is starting to open up, and there is a lot of need for new employees for a lot of different industries,\" he said. </p><p>   The company said Wednesday that it is raising wages for its hourly workers, providing more than 500,000 employees with pay increases of between 50 cents and $3 an hour. Amazon pays a starting wage of $15 an hour, but the pay increase represents an investment of more than $1 billion. </p><p>   While the increase covers a variety of workers and schedules, it would amount to about $40 a week per worker if averaged over 500,000 employees. </p><p>   Amazon's dominance in online retail parallels the strength of Amazon Web Services, the business line that rents server capacity and software tools to other corporations. AWS is Amazon's main profit center, though its recent growth slowed as the cloud units of Microsoft and Google have moved aggressively to sign up new customers. Sales for the cloud unit totaled $13.5 billion in the first quarter, a 32% increase from a year earlier. </p><p>   AWS Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy is set to take over as Amazon's CEO in the third quarter after Jeff Bezos said in February that he would depart the role to become executive chairman. </p><p>   Amazon's ad business has become a major player in its industry. The fast-developing unit has put the company in competition with Google's and Facebook's leading ad businesses. Amazon's category that includes ad sales rose 77% in the first quarter from a year earlier to $6.9 billion. </p><p>   The coronavirus pandemic helped Amazon, Facebook and Google grow stronger, with the tech companies for the first time collecting the majority of all ad spending in the U.S. last year, The Wall Street Journal reported in March. </p><p>   \"What we always get back to with Amazon is the optionality -- they have multiple businesses firing off,\" said John Blackledge, an analyst with investment firm Cowen Inc. He said with the pandemic's end in sight, investors are eager to see Amazon expand its one-day shipping offerings. </p><p>   The largest U.S. tech companies recorded staggering growth last year as consumers and businesses relied more on online shopping, software and cloud services, as well as their smart devices and video streaming. The combined revenue for Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft grew by one-fifth to $1.1 trillion. Their collective market capitalization soared to almost $8 trillion at the end of 2020, compared with about $5 trillion at the end of 2019. </p><p>   Amazon's achievements have come as regulators increasingly scrutinize the company's market power. Congress has considered changes to antitrust laws that could make it easier for the government to challenge certain business strategies and practices or force tech giants to separate certain units. </p><p></p>",
