  "title": "FTC Challenges Nvidia's $40 Billion Deal for Arm Holdings; The agency alleges the semiconductor deal is anticompetitive",
  "text": "<p>If the deal were allowed, the combined firm could stifle next-generation technologies, including ones used to run data centers and driver-assistance systems in cars, the FTC alleged.</p><p>Arm is owned by Tokyo-based SoftBank Group Corp.</p><p>The commission, currently comprised of two Democrats and two Republicans, voted 4-0 to file the lawsuit. It is the FTC's first antitrust case since President Biden's nominee Lina Khan took over as the commission's chairwoman.</p><p>\"As we move into this next step in the FTC process, we will continue to work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition,\" Nvidia said in a statement.</p><p>The deal, first announced in September 2020, raised eyebrows with regulators and chip-making rivals. Arm, based in Cambridge, England, is one of the world's most important behind-the-scenes semiconductor companies. SoftBank, which bought Arm five years ago for $32 billion, had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.</p><p>Arm designs and licenses the basic blueprints of chips that are in around 90% of the world's smartphones. Companies such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rely on its design expertise for some of their chips, with Arm acting as a kind of Switzerland to the chip industryâ€”offering its designs to everyone without favoring any one company. Nvidia and Arm are promising that won't change.</p><p>Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia last month said the FTC had expressed concern about the deal. The chip company's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said at the time Nvidia was \"engaged in discussions with the FTC regarding remedies to address those concerns.\"</p><p>The U.K. in April launched a national-security review after having already begun a probe on antitrust grounds. The British government had sought assurances about the headquarters and jobs remaining in the country. Last month, London extended a probe into the deal, citing what it said were \"significant competition concerns.\"</p><p>Nvidia Pursues Arm Holdings</p><p>* Nvidia's Takeover of Arm Raises Competition Concerns, U.K. Regulator Says (Aug. 20, 2021)</p><p>* What Are Nvidia and Arm?
