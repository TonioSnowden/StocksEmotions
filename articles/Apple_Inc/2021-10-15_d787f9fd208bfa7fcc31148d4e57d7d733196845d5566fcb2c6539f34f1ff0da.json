  "title": "'Halloween Kills' Star Jamie Lee Curtis on Why She 'Loathes' Being Scared; A queen of the horror genre, the actress talked to us about 'MacGyvering' a podcast studio, her love of mid-century furniture—and her inconvenient aversion to fear",
  "text": "<p>What's your favorite performance by Jamie Lee Curtis? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Ms. Curtis, 62, comes by terror naturally. It's an expression she's worn her entire life, she says. \"Even when I was a toddler, I was always looking over my shoulder,\" she admitted in a recent Zoom interview, holding up her phone to flash a black-and-white picture of herself as a child. \"I'm always looking like I'm in trouble or someone's angry at me or something is coming at me,\" she said of the surviving record of those early years.</p><p>Michael Myers has been coming at Ms. Curtis since 1978's \"Halloween,\" the movie that launched her career. \"Kills,\" which hits theaters and the Peacock streaming service today, picks up immediately after 2018's \"Halloween\" and will be followed next year by \"Halloween Ends.\" The horror franchise might have made Ms. Curtis's career, but they're not movies she has any interest in watching. \"I have zero affection for the horror genre,\" she said. As she recently shared with us, she does, however, have passionate feelings about everything from furniture to architecture, books and her own patented MacGyver moves. But being frightened? Not so much.</p><p>I loathe to be: Scared. Loathe with a capital \"L.\" And yet it is how I have made my entire career, which was born really from the 1978 \"Halloween\" movie. And it's ironic that I'm 'that' girl, because the truth is I'm terrified.</p><p>I went to the 'Halloween Kills' premiere dressed as: my mother, Janet Leigh, in her role from \"Psycho.\" I wore a blue dress, my mother's wig and a shower curtain I ordered on Amazon and then covered in fake blood that I draped over my arm as a stole.</p><p>In lieu of having graduated college, I listen to: KCRW, my local public radio station. I'm an uneducated well-educated woman and a lot of my well-education is because of KCRW.</p><p>I recently read for the first time: \"The Sun Also Rises.\" A small group of friends and I are in the middle of a deep-dive into the work of Ernest Hemingway. Then we're going to move on to John Steinbeck, my favorite.</p><p>I have rocked a good costume or two, but I've never: worn a Michael Myers one. I went as Vega from \"Street Fighter\"' when my daughter and I went to the Evo e-sports event in Vegas for her 18th birthday. I've also been an Orc at [the annual gaming convention] BlizzCon. But I leave Michael to Michael.</p><p>I spend the beginning of every day: in my Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman. My husband, Christopher Guest, gave it to me 35 years ago. The leather's all cracked and it's been beaten up and puked on by my children and my dog, and yet, I love it. I've always been drawn to midcentury modern design.</p><p>I like to take visitors to: the Eames House in Pacific Palisades, Calif., where Charles and Ray Eames lived and worked. The house demonstrates the difference between minimalism—which isn't what they were about—and function. They were making things that were functional. The simplicity of the steel and concrete belies the fact that there were tons of things in their house.</p><p>The single greatest invention is: the Bandolier, a crossbody smartphone holder. As soon as I bought one, it was life-changing. I thought, 'I don't have to carry a purse. I don't have to carry cash,' because it incorporates a wallet. I have given hundreds out as gifts.</p><p>I've never felt as seen and heard and appreciated as when: [Lionsgate's then-president of global marketing] Damon Wolf invited me into the marketing meeting for \"Knives Out.\" Most people don't let me talk. Most people are like: 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, you just look cute, just do your thing.' I am an ideas person.</p><p>Growing up, I wanted to be: a police officer. I'm good with people. I like law and order. I believe in that fundamental idea that our world would be an anarchy without some sort of law enforcement. And I am a very good girl, and I was a very good girl.</p><p>My mother taught me to: write thank-you notes.</p><p>My father taught me that: the words \"in perpetuity\" are in every contract that you sign as an actor. When you're young and hungry, you'll sign anything to get a job. And he reminded me that you have to be mindful that you're signing something, because if it's a movie, it's going to live forever.</p><p>I have every: Leica camera that there has been from the M6 all the way up. I'm a Leica photographer. In fact, Daniel Craig gave me one of his Daniel Craig Leica Q2s that he made with [photographer] Greg Williams.</p><p>​You could change my last name to: MacGyver. I am constantly MacGyvering. I love wedges and little shims and duct tape. I am that girl. I am a fixer.</p><p>I have received two patents for: baby diapers. The first idea came to me in the 1980s, when I was changing a diaper on one end of a counter and the wipes were six feet away. I went: Wow, someone should build a diaper with wipes built into the front. I started MacGyvering the diaper.</p><p>I invented Instagram before Instagram back when: I noticed the iPhone took really good pictures. I contacted 30 photographer friends of mine and on June 8, 2010, we all started sharing our pictures with each other at iphoneys.blogspot.com. It's still there.</p><p>The first time I heard the song 'Good Friend' by Emily King, I: thought, well, that's a great theme song for a podcast about friendship. I'm going to Twitter stalk her. And I asked her if she'd let me use it, which she did, and I created a podcast called \"Good Friend.\" It's conversations about friendship with people like Lena Dunham and Maria Shriver.</p><p>I created a recording studio out of: outdoor pool floats, an umbrella and quilts to record my part for the first season of the scripted podcast I co-created, \"Letters from Camp.\" For the second season, I was able to set up a proper recording studio in my office–with a Shure microphone, thank you very much–and I now feel incredibly professional. Jake Gyllenhaal was living in my office in Los Angeles for a few months during the pandemic and he recorded his portion of \"Letters From Camp'' season one by climbing under a desk and creating a sound hole for himself.</p><p>—Edited from an interview by Chris Kornelis</p><p>'Halloween Kills' Star Jamie Lee Curtis on Why She 'Loathes' Being Scared</p>",
