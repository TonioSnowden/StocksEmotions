  "text": "<p>The Brexit story is a funny old mix these days of continued recriminations over the economic impacts of leaving the single market, reruns of the familiar fights over Northern Ireland and yet, slowly but surely, the gradual framing of a new post-EU economic landscape.</p> <p>So this week, while a majority of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a91e6b2-808a-4b17-96e4-3391dc2dca39\">MPs voted</a> (in a throwback to 2020) for lawbreaking legislation to unilaterally disapply the Northern Ireland protocol, the government also published the results of its consultation on regulating medical devices after Brexit.</p> <p>That may sound like a nuggety subject, indeed the 155 pages aren't exactly bedtime reading, but the document is instructive about the broader direction of travel when it comes to how the post-Brexit “nimble Britain” concept will play out in reality.</p> <p>A year ago I reported on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b37791d-9e7e-4e7b-8b4d-eacce84398d4\">widespread concerns in the medtech industry</a> about the dangers of diverging too far, too fast from EU rules in order, as the health innovation minister Lord James Bethell put it, to “grasp the opportunity of innovation now we have left the EU”.</p> <p>The basis for those fears was simple for an industry that relies on accessing global markets to recoup investment: the combined EU market represents nearly 22 per cent of global healthcare spending, compared with just 3 per cent in the UK. </p> <p>A separate UK regulatory regime for devices that need, in any case, to be cleared for the EU market obviously risked being commercially counterproductive.</p> <p>So a year on, how did that work out? Well, judging by the outcome of the consultation, the answer (after the government surveyed 413 individuals and 451 organisations) is pretty prosaic: if Brexit portends a regulatory revolution, it is one that will come by increments whose ultimate consequences today remain uncertain.</p> <p>There are two immediate headlines from the consultation which speak squarely to the practical limits of go-it-alone Britain's ability to obtain a regulatory advantage in a complex and highly globalised marketplace.</p> <p>The first is a decision by the UK to offer a hefty transition period for companies to adjust to any new regulations, with devices that have an EU “CE” mark recognised as safe for the UK market for up to five years. </p> <p>So while the UK is not giving up on its post-Brexit equivalent, the UKCA mark, it is taking it slowly, and has promised a review of the grace periods at the end of the five-year period, which doesn't rule out the possibility of further extension of dual recognition.</p> <p>The second is an acceptance that the UK just doesn't have the operational capacity to move any faster: the recently restructured regulator (the MHRA) has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ef390b4-2d57-42fa-9ac6-88c08307eade\">undergone budget and staff cuts</a> while the commercial marketplace for so-called ‘Conformity Assessment Bodies' that companies must use to test and certify medical devices desperately needs expansion.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, this pragmatism comes as a <a href=\"https://www.bivda.org.uk/News-Events/BIVDA-Press-Releases/ArticleID/715/BIVDA-Press-Release-BIVDA-welcomes-MHRA%E2%80%99s-formal-response-to-the-consultation-on-future-regulation-of-medical-devices-in-the-UK\">relief to the industry bodies </a>like British Healthcare Trades Association and BIVDA (the trade body for in vitro diagnostic devices) which had warned that pushing too far, too fast would hurt both industry and patients.</p> <p>As William Lee, head of policy and compliance at the British Healthcare Trades Association, wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.bhta.com/mhra-consultation-response-government-responds-to-consultation-on-the-future-of-medical-device-regulation-in-the-uk/\">blog</a> after the consultation findings were published, the government has acknowledged serious industry concerns “with regard to continuity of supply, shortage of conformity assessment bodies, hard-pressed MHRA resource, and the need for industry input into guidance on how the regime will operate”.</p> <p>The second fundamental recognition in the consultation, as James Moore, professor of medical device design at Imperial College, London observes, is that the UK government has accepted industry demands to remain largely aligned with EU standards. </p> <p>As the consultation document noted, “a significant number of responses requested close alignment with [EU rules and standards] . . . to avoid confusion and potentially duplicative or divergent requirements and to facilitate the ongoing supply of devices to the UK market”.</p> <p>It adds: “In light of this, our intention is to broadly reflect the GSPRs [General Safety and Performance Requirements] in the UK regulations, tailored to the domestic context.”</p> <p>This is borne out by Moore's own industry survey, which is yet to be published, in which he interviewed more than 40 medtech SMEs, trade bodies and funding groups. The desire to remain aligned with the EU is a clear thread that runs through those responses.</p> <p>So also is deep frustration with the NHS, which in theory should be a unique test-bed for new medical devices, but in practice is a byzantine mess. </p> <p>Respondents complained it was too slow, too financially constrained, too fractured, too restrictive in outlook (so start-ups struggle to get their devices accepted) and doesn't involve doctors enough in procurement. </p> <p>The UK was compared unfavourably to the kind of smaller “nimble” countries, like Israel and South Korea, which some Brexiters often believe the UK should be striving to emulate.</p> <p>But still, overall Moore, who was one of those raising concerns about post-Brexit medtech regulation a year ago, is encouraged by the realism being shown at the outset of this journey — albeit with the caveat that in many areas the details of the regulations are still to be fleshed out. </p> <p>“There's still a lot that could go wrong, because of the degree to which the government is not committing to a lot of hard lines on these issues,” he adds. “So there's still a lot of wriggle room, but I'm more encouraged by this.”</p> <p>But what about those potential upsides? As Derek Hill, professor of digital health at UCL observes, despite the broad commitment to alignment with EU rules, there are some areas in which the UK is seeking to do things differently.</p> <p>Post-Brexit the UK has joined the International Medical Device Regulators Forum in its own right (it participated previously via its EU membership) which Hill says may enable the UK to influence future global approaches to medical device regulation, and then implement the forum's recommendations more rapidly than the EU.</p> <p>“The UK no doubt hopes it can work with what they call ‘like-minded regulators' to address emerging challenges in medical device regulation, including artificial intelligence in medical devices and products that sit at the interface of drugs and devices,” he says.</p> <p>Hill adds that the UK is seeking to make it easier to deploy medical devices that are on Apple's AppStore or Google's Play Store, but which store data outside the UK; and take a more forward-leaning approach to deploying and updating innovative software in medical devices. </p> <p>He sums up the MHRA approach as “pragmatic”, for the most part aligning with the EU regulatory framework and international standards, but with “some recommendations opening up opportunities for regulatory innovation in certain areas, like medical devices containing AI software.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Whether this approach will, to quote from the government press release, make the UK the “best place to develop and introduce innovative medical devices” and transform the UKCA mark into a “global exemplar” of best practice, is very much harder to say. Divergence is not a one-way bet: it comes with costs as well as benefits.</p> <p>What is clearer, however, is that away from the world-beating bluster, the real Brexit regulatory revolution proceeds by baby steps, not leaps and bounds.</p> <p><em>Do you work in the medical technology field? Do you think Brexit presents the UK with regulatory opportunities. Email me at britainafterbrexit@ft.com</em></p> <h1>Brexit in numbers</h1> <p>The government likes to focus on the “opportunities of Brexit” while sceptics instead focus on the costs — when in reality there are both opportunities and costs, and the question is whether one outweighs the other, both now and overtime.</p> <p>Today's chart from the <a href=\"https://www.santandercb.co.uk/sites/default/files/documents/trade_barometer_spring_2022.pdf\">Santander Trade Barometer 2022</a> highlights the cost of building new bureaucratic barriers between the UK and the EU, but potentially points to the opportunity that flows from all businesses now having to master that bureaucracy.</p> <p>It is striking that major markets like Italy, Spain, Germany and France which were friction-free until Brexit are now seen as more bureaucratic than Canada, Australia or the UAE and US.</p> <p>But on the upside, businesses that now are forced to build capacity and networks so they can export to the EU — hiring customs, logistics, VAT and other experts — find themselves equipped to export to the rest of the world.</p> <p>As a foreign correspondent for 15 years in South Asia, China and the US, it was routine to hear UK trade promotion bodies complain how difficult it was to inculcate that exporting outlook to SMEs in the UK — compared to companies in, say, Germany or Israel. </p> <p>When Liam Fox in 2016 upset everyone by remarking that UK business was sometimes “too lazy and fat” to embrace global trade, his point wasn't entirely without foundation. For many UK companies, it was certainly easier thanks to EU membership just to export closer to home.</p> <p>This isn't to be naive. Today's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a31b4b8e-f9fc-4f1e-84c1-3632f194d05a\">new trade figures</a> make dismal reading and appear to bear out academic studies that have found Brexit barriers have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0860ee6-e06e-4fc4-bd87-d56dcc7ee946\">significantly shrunk</a> the number of exporting relationships with the EU.</p> <p>More than a third of the 1,017 businesses with turnover in excess of £1mn surveyed by YouGov for the Barometer said the current Brexit trade deal is not sufficient for them to continue trading with the EU.</p> <p>But for those companies that have persisted and mastered the new bureaucracy, the experience of Brexit may yet embolden them to lift their eyes to more distant markets.</p> <p><strong>And, finally, three unmissable Brexit stories</strong></p> <p>While Boris Johnson secured a crucial second reading for a bill that will pave the way for him to rip up the <strong>Northern Ireland protocol</strong>, the UK's foreign secretary Liz Truss laid out the reasons for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78a0998c-64c7-47a6-b5e5-5cf132fa3b55\">ditching the international agreement</a> in an article for the FT. But, as Jude Webber found, many businesses in the province are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96096b2a-bdac-490c-9a46-97a7f69b924d\">profiting from the trading arrangements</a>. </p> <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> set October 19 2023 as the date for a new independence referendum this week. The FT's new Scotland correspondent Lukanyo Myyanda looks at how Brexit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52b90df4-08e2-4660-adfc-2c1ef1f8692a\">could be a game changer</a> for the SNP leader in any future vote. </p> <p>The <strong>Conservatives</strong>' longstanding love affair with older voters <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37b43960-2a83-4c8b-bead-4bf84beae5b9\">has climaxed under Boris Johnson</a>, writes Simon Kuper. It's an old people's party and that's a winning strategy in a country where most voters are now over 55, he writes.</p><p>Source: Peter Foster 2022 'UK takes a pragmatic approach to medical regulation' FT.com 30 June.
