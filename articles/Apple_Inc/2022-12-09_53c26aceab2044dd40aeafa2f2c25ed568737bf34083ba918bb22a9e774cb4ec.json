  "title": "Technology & Business:  FTC Asks Judge  To Stop Meta From  Buying VR Startup  ----  By Jan Wolfe and Salvador Rodriguez",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission asked a judge to halt Meta Platforms Inc.'s planned acquisition of a virtual-reality startup, a case that represents a shift in U.S. antitrust enforcement and poses a challenge to the Facebook parent's metaverse strategy. </p><p>   The FTC is seeking an injunction blocking Meta's planned acquisition of Within Unlimited Inc., the company behind popular virtual-reality fitness game \"Supernatural.\" </p><p>   The lawsuit is being closely watched because it is based on an unusual theory of competitive harm focusing on potential future competition in a nascent industry. The case is widely seen as emblematic of FTC Chair Lina Khan's frequent criticisms of powerful technology companies. </p><p>   Meta said last month that the FTC's case is based on ideology and speculation -- not evidence of anticompetitive conduct. Meta said it is \"confident the evidence will show that our acquisition of Within will be good for people, developers and the VR space, which is experiencing vibrant competition.\" </p><p>   The FTC's request is before U.S. District Judge Edward Davila, who will hear arguments and testimony over two weeks in his San Jose, Calif., courtroom. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is listed as a potential witness. </p><p>   Meta announced its intention to buy Within Unlimited in 2021. The company didn't disclose the value of the deal. </p><p>   The transaction is part of Meta's big bet on immersive virtual worlds, or metaverses. </p><p>   Meta could have chosen to use its resources to build its own app, and it was planning to do so until it heard a rumor that rival Apple Inc. was interested in buying Within Unlimited, said Abby Dennis, senior trial counsel at the FTC, in her opening remarks. </p><p>   In its July complaint, the FTC accused Meta of trying to buy its way to the top of the virtual-reality market, rather than competing on the merits. </p><p>   In opening remarks, Meta lawyers argued that the company didn't have plans to build its own VR-fitness app. Meta is entrenched in a competitive VR market, and there is no requirement that a company must build rather than buy its own apps, said Mark Hansen, a lawyer for the company. </p><p>   The FTC originally framed Meta and Within as direct competitors in the market for virtual-reality fitness products. </p><p>   In an unusual move, the agency withdrew that theory by filing an amended complaint in October. </p><p>   The FTC's case now hinges on a theory that the Meta-Within deal is a threat to \"potential competition\" in the future. The agency says blocking Meta from buying Within would enhance competition because Meta would be forced to develop an app that competes with Within's \"Supernatural.\" </p><p>   Historically, when U.S. regulators seek to block mergers, they focus on direct competitors in more mature markets, said Rebecca Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. \"The lack of head-to-head competition in this case makes it hard to win, but I don't think it's a nonmeritorious case,\" she said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Dave Michaels contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
