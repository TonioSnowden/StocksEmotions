  "text": "<p>Insider Inc., the parent of Business Insider and related properties, roared back in the second half of the year, posting 30% revenue growth for 2020 while turning a profit, Mr. Blodget said. A person familiar with the matter said the company generated over $150 million in revenue.</p><p>Business Insider, which blends business news and pop culture coverage, benefited from the combination of a burgeoning subscription business and its reliance on a form of automated advertising that held up relatively well in the pandemic, but which many peers have drifted away from.</p><p>Insider Inc. was able to continue a hiring spree despite the turmoil. The company added 200 employees in 2020, 130 of them in the newsroom, and now employs just over 500 people in all.</p><p>\"We feel extremely fortunate to have come through it the way we have,\" Mr. Blodget said in an interview.</p><p>Across the online publishing world, advertising sales improved somewhat over the course of 2020, but not enough to avoid cuts. BuzzFeed Inc. laid off at least 50 people, Vox Media Inc. cut 72 and Vice Media slashed over 150. At Atlantic Media, backed by multibillionaire owner Laurene Powell Jobs, more than 70 people were let go. Mergers have been afoot in the industry as companies bet on consolidation to put their businesses on stronger footing.</p><p>Mr. Blodget, a former stock analyst, launched Business Insider in 2007. Axel Springer acquired it in a 2015 deal that valued the company at $390 million. At the time, Business Insider generated around $50 million in annual revenue, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Advertising is the company's dominant source of revenue. In the past few years publishers began to shift away from relying on \"programmatic ads\" -- those sold in real time through computerized exchanges -- to higher-priced direct-sold ads. Business Insider didn't make that shift as fully and had an advantage at the start of the pandemic: direct-sold ads dried up, while marketers looking for the best price continued to buy programmatic ads, industry watchers said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a push at Business Insider to develop a subscription business flourished in 2020, with the number of subscribers doubling to just north of 100,000, people familiar with the matter said. The site charges $12.95 a month for a subscription, though it offers significant introductory discounts, they said.</p><p>Continuing that momentum will be challenging as all major publishers chase subscribers. Among rival business-focused publications, Bloomberg LP has around 250,000 subscribers to its website and business news site Quartz has around 25,000. The Wall Street Journal had 2.35 million digital subscribers as of the September quarter.</p><p>Most of Insider Inc.'s recent editorial hiring has been aimed at developing content that people will pay for. The newsroom has made additions in its investigations, corporate, finance and tech teams and created a 10-person Washington, D.C., bureau.</p><p>\"We had always been a place that has hired carefully and slowly,\" said Nicholas Carlson, Insider's global editor in chief. \"But now that we have a lot of the business in place, we decided to ramp hiring up.\"</p><p>The growing staff has also shifted the culture of a newsroom built in Business Insider's early years around rapid-fire posts and headlines aimed at generating traction on social media. Now a kind of bifurcated newsroom has emerged, staffers say: Reporters who focus on pop culture and general news continue to dominate the company's traffic measurements, while business reporters strategize on stories to help propel the subscription business.</p><p>For example, the company has put more resources into reporting executive moves and other insider corporate announcements. \"People at Cisco want to know who the rising stars at Salesforce are,\" Mr. Carlson said.</p><p>Over the course of 2020, traffic across all of Insider's sites, which also includes the general news-focused Insider.com, averaged 114 million unique U.S. visitors a month, according to Comscore Inc.</p>",
