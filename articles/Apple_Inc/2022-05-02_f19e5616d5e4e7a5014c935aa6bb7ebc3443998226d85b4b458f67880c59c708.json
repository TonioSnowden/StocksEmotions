  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 19 points, or 0.1%, at 32,996.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up less than a point at 4,132.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP traded at 12,336, hoverin gnear unchanged.</p><p>On Friday, the Dow fell 939 points, or 2.8%, to leave the blue-chip gauge down 4.9% in April. The S&amp;P 500 fell sharply, entering its second market correction of 2022 and leaving it with an 8.8% monthly decline. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 saw their biggest monthly percentage drops since March 2020.</p><p>The Nasdaq, meanwhile, dropped 13.3% in April for its worst monthly performance since October 2008.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The Institute for Supply Management said its index of U.S. manufacturing activity fell 1.7 points to 55.4% in Apriland showed the industrial side of the economy grew at the slowest clip in 18 months, reflecting broad supply and labor bottlenecks and intense inflationary pressures. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast the index to rise to 57.8% from a one-and-a-half year low of 57.1% in March. Any number above 50% signifies growth.</p><p>But the focus is on the state of the economy ahead of what's expected to be a half-point rate hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.</p><p>Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital, says the best chance of a rally this week is after the Fed decision on Wednesday, as the hike is expected, and as stocks typically rally after press conferences. But he doesn't think any rally will last.</p><p>\"I don't see how this market rallies unless the Fed pivots to a more dovish stance or valuations get low enough that fundamentals can support the market. I don't think fundamentals can help this market yet. So lower prices are likely to come after any FOMC rebound,\" said Kramer.</p><p>Treasury yields resumed a march higher Monday, another headwind for the growth stocks that populate the Nasdaq. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y jumped nearly 9 basis points to 2.973%.
