  "title": "The Acura Integra is back for 2023, and it's more than just a sedan; For enthusiasts, a 6-speed manual transmission option evokes the glory days of the older model",
  "text": "<p>* Stylish yet practical body</p><p>* Turbocharged engine</p><p>Cons</p><p>* The engine is a little low on torque</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* The Integra is all-new for 2023</p><p>Price: The 2023 Acura Integra starts at $30,800.</p><p>The 2023 Acura Integra is an all-new premium compact sedan and the most affordable new Acura. It revives a name from the days when Acura had more excitement going for it (the '90s, when the first NSX supercar was also around) and replaces the ILX.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the new Integra is a 5-door liftback. It has a hatchback instead of a trunk. But we'll call it a sedan for the sake of expediency.</p><p>Like the ILX, the Integra is based on a Honda HMC Civic platform. Now there's a fresh generation of Civic, which debuted for the 2022 model year, prompting this new Acura model. And as platforms go, the Civic's is excellent. This new Integra is made in the United States at Honda/Acura's plant in Marysville, Ohio.</p><p>2023 Acura Integra pricing</p><p>The 2023 Acura Integra has a starting price of $30,800, plus a destination fee of $1,095. In A-Spec form, the 2023 Integra begins at $32,800, while the A-Spec with technology package has a starting price of $35,800 — with a CVT or a 6-speed manual transmission.</p><p>A more extreme version of the Integra may join the range at some point, perhaps priced closer to $45K.</p><p>Other small premium sedans include the Audi A3, from around $35K. The Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class costs about $38K (there's a cheaper A-Class, but potential Integra buyers might well prefer the sleeker CLA). Or the BMW XE:BMW 228i Gran Coupe is about $36K.</p><p>Among this crowd, the 2023 Integra is priced keenly. Alternatively, the Volkswagen VWAGY Golf GTI (hatchback) is almost as luxurious and has an enthusiast heritage arguably greater than the Integra. It starts at around $30K and is appreciably more powerful.</p><p>Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area paid for their new Integra. Since this car is all-new for 2023, there's no information yet on resale values.</p><p>Driving the 2023 Acura Integra</p><p>The same engine as the sporty Honda Civic Si is under the aluminum hood of the 2023 Integra. It makes a pleasant 200 horsepower, but a little more torque than 192 lb-ft would surely have been possible from a turbocharged engine.</p><p>The standard-issue transmission is of the continuously variable variety — which is not the first, second, or even third choice of an enthusiast. But there it is, and anyone who doesn't want to get to grips with a stick shift will have to put up with it.</p><p>Fortunately, an enthusiast's first choice is available, a 6-speed manual transmission. The ratios are close together, a short-throw shift action provides maximum sportiness, and there's a rev-matching feature on the downshifts. It also brings a helical limited-slip differential for optimum traction.</p><p>This manual transmission becomes eligible with the A-Spec treatment. Add the Technology package, and an adaptive suspension is in the mix. Although the ILX was more about comfort, the new Integra comes with a sport-tuned suspension and a variable-ratio steering system as standard.</p><p>Another aspect of the technology package is the addition of a customizable Individual setting to the other standard selectable driving modes of comfort, normal, and sport.</p><p>Don't miss: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>Thin pillars enhance outward vision, and rear side airbags are standard in the new 2023 Integra. One of the most distinctive features, though, is the liftback section. The rear seats split and fold in the usual 60/40 manner, creating a flat load space and resulting in flexibility for carrying cargo and/or passengers.</p><p>The A-Spec package brings red needles for the gauges, stainless steel pedals, and contrast stitching on the steering wheel, seats, and shift boot. The technology package livens up the standard simulated leather seating surfaces with inserts of simulated suede.</p><p>The basic infotainment system has a 7-inch touchscreen, and the technology package brings a 9-inch version. For an immersive audio experience, two of the 16 speakers in the ELS Studio sound system (part of the technology package) sit above the front occupants.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The 5-door liftback design of the 2023 Integra blends a bit of pizazz with practicality. It's definitely more interesting than a regular sedan and is another nod to past Integra models.</p><p>Cosmetic additions with the A-Spec package include a lip spoiler, various exterior details finished in gloss black, and 18-inch alloy wheels in Shark Gray.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Acura Precision Cockpit A 10.2-inch digital driver information display is standard in every new Integra premium sedan. It can be configured to show various pages of information.</p><p>Manual transmission This 6-speed manual transmission evokes the glory days of the older Integra model and allows drivers to get the most out of the new car's 200-horsepower engine.</p><p>Also read: What California's ban on gas cars could mean for you—even if you don't live there</p><p>Standard features</p><p>Before any options, the 2023 Integra sedan comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights/daytime running lights/taillights, powered moonroof, heated front seats, 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat, and simulated leather seating surfaces.</p><p>The infotainment system is based around a 7-inch touchscreen and includes Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration (not wireless), one USB-A port, and eight speakers.</p><p>Among the standard safety features is forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, plus blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.</p><p>Factory options</p><p>The A-Spec package for the new Integra sedan brings LED fog lights, an appearance bundle, 18-inch alloy wheels, plus eligibility for the manual transmission and the technology package.</p><p>The technology package adds puddle lights, front/rear parking sensors, an adaptive suspension, a head-up display, and low-speed automatic emergency braking. It also includes ambient LED cabin lighting, wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, three USB-A ports, 9-inch infotainment touchscreen, Amazon AMZN Alexa compatibility, wireless charging, 12-way power-adjustable driver's seat with memory settings, 4-way power-adjustable front passenger seat, 16-speaker ELS Studio audio system. For Integra versions with the automatic transmission, the technology package also gets a remote start function.</p><p>Don't miss: 10 cars that are being discontinued this year (and there could be bargains here)</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>A turbocharged 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine drives the new Integra with 200 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. A standard automatic transmission sends this to the front wheels.</p><p>There's no option for all-wheel drive. A 6-speed manual transmission is available, however.</p><p>This same engine is in the Honda Civic Si, where premium gasoline is recommended. So it's best to use premium here as well.</p><p>1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 200 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 192 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-5,000 rpm EPA city/highway fuel economy: N/A</p><p>KBB's car review methodology .</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com.</p><p>The Acura Integra is back for 2023, and it's more than just a sedan</p>",
