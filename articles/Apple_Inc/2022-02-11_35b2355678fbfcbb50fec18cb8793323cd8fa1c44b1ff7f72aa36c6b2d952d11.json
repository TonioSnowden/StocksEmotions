  "title": "MANSION --- Balance Sheet: An Actor's Dramatic Renovation --- Zoe Boyle and her cinematographer husband embarked on a project to merge two apartments just as the pandemic hit",
  "text": "<p>The couple married in summer 2019 and they wanted to swap their warehouse apartment for a more permanent home. Mr. Spence had two priorities for their new place: He wanted to live in the east London borough of Hackney, where he was raised, and he wanted a spacious house. \"We wanted something open plan, but with the flavor of an old London house,\" he said.</p><p>For her part, Ms. Boyle, 37, who played Lavinia Swire on the TV series \"Downton Abbey\" and Trinity Ashby on \"Sons of Anarchy,\" was happy to take on a project house rather than pay a premium for a home renovated to someone else's tastes. \"I grew up with my parents always renovating houses, and although it could be a bit chaotic, it was something I was used to,\" she said.</p><p>Their house, when they found it, had great potential, but it had been split into two properties. One was a gloomy, dark and damp one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment on the basement level. The other was a four-bedroom, one-bathroom house on the three upper floors. Altogether, the property measured around 2,100 square feet, which ticked one of Mr. Spence's boxes. \"And the upper floors had classic Victorian proportions with high ceilings and big windows and some original features,\" he added. \"We could see the potential.\"</p><p>Eager to get started, the couple hired Bradley Van Der Straeten Architects to help them draw up plans to reunite the house and apartment. They secured building permits and found a contractor.</p><p>Then came the pandemic.</p><p>Britain went into its first national lockdown at the end of March 2020, and the couple were forced to put their plans on pause. \"It was a difficult time for everybody, we were paying rent and mortgage, and at the time it felt like the world was ending,\" said Mr. Spence.</p><p>The couple spent that initial lockdown fine-tuning their plans for the house but it wasn't until August 2020 that they were finally able to start the work.</p><p>Unforeseen expenses included treating damp in the basement, tackling an outbreak of black mold in the attic, and repairs required to the roof. \"Even things we thought would be easy turned out to be really expensive,\" said Ms. Boyle. One was that they had two gas meters and they had to have one removed and one moved.</p><p>\"We thought it wouldn't be very difficult,\" she said. \"but it ended up costing GBP 8,000 [$10,860], and we are still dealing with the administration because it turned out they took out the wrong meter.\"</p><p>Unifying the house with the extended basement meant installing a new timber staircase. The basement now contains a large, open-plan kitchen and living room with sliding glass doors leading out to the backyard. A new skylight throws more light into the room, while its exposed timber joists and timber floors add natural texture.</p><p>The house needed a lot of basic maintenance including full rewiring, and the replacement of its aged sash windows with double-glazed versions. The small kitchen, which had serviced the main house, was repurposed as a guest bathroom.</p><p>They also redecorated the whole house, including a large living room on the first floor, the principal bedroom with en-suite bathroom on the second floor, and an office, guest bedroom, and a third bedroom now used as a gym on the third floor.</p><p>Agreeing on a color scheme was a particular challenge for this couple, since Mr. Spence likes clean, white lines and plenty of light, and Ms. Boyle is a fan of rich, deep, and unexpected colors. The solution, suggested by their architects, was to use blocks of color against a white backdrop.</p><p>The white kitchen has cabinets painted an intense plum and the interiors of the enclosed staircase linking the basement to the upper house is sky blue. \"They are all heritage colors which are based in nature, so it doesn't feel too clown-like or carnivally,\" she said.</p><p>Upstairs, the experiments with color continue: The guest bathroom has sunshine-yellow tiles, offset with black metal hardware, while the living room, with its original bay window and open fireplaces, is painted in tones of yellow and sage. Ms. Boyle's love of color is given free rein in the primary bedroom, with its anthracite walls and ceiling, rich orange carpet, and blue velvet bed. The en-suite bathroom, meanwhile, is apple green.</p><p>Three months behind on their schedule, in March 2021, the couple were finally able to move into their house. \"Being here during the lockdowns, and having so much space, was great,\" she said.</p><p>\"Even though it is quite a big house, more than half of it is living space rather than sleeping space and we really do use every single room,\" Ms. Boyle said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
