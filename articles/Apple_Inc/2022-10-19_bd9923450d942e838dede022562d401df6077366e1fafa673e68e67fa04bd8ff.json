  "text": "<p>The NFL and Amazon indicated the plan is for the game to become a permanent fixture.</p><p>The game will be a \"key new pillar\" for the league, NFL Media Chief Operating Officer Hans Schroeder said on a conference call to discuss the new game. Marie Donoghue, Amazon's vice president of global sports video, said: \"We see this as starting a new holiday tradition.\"</p><p>For Amazon, having an NFL game on its streaming platform on what is known as the biggest shopping day of the year would give it a large promotional platform for its own retail efforts.</p><p>The deal deepens the partnership between the NFL and Amazon, which this season started streaming the league's \"Thursday Night Football\" franchise. Amazon has an 11-year deal for \"Thursday Night Football\" at a price tag of $1.2 billion annually, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.</p><p>Neither the league or Amazon would comment on the terms of adding a new game to Amazon's current package.</p><p>The new game also gets Amazon in on Thanksgiving weekend. While Amazon has \"Thursday Night Football,\" its package doesn't include a Thanksgiving game. The NFL's Thanksgiving games are on CBS, NBC and Fox.</p><p>Amazon is also among the potential suitors for NFL's Sunday Ticket package, which will be available after this season. Sunday Ticket is a direct-to-consumer offering currently available on satellite broadcaster DirecTV that allows subscribers access to all out-of-market games. Apple Inc. and Google's YouTube also are circling the property, the Journal has reported.</p>",
