  "text": "<p>Random House, 335 pages, $28</p><p>Toward the end of crime reporter Justin Fenton's account of the catastrophic reign of a Baltimore police unit that became synonymous with law-enforcement corruption and brutality, BPD detective Ryan Guinn touches on a paradox many of his colleagues see at the heart of police work. Speaking of another officer's brazen disregard for the law, Mr. Guinn protests: \"He cut corners -- yeah, what cop doesn't cut corners? Show me a cop who goes A-to-Z and hits every letter in their investigation. With the pressure we're put under to produce?\"</p><p>The nexus between the \"pressure\" brought by civic leaders clamoring for an answer to gun violence, and the less lofty realities of the practical world of policing comes into focus in the story of one notorious team's origins and descent into infamy, as told by a longtime journalist for the Baltimore Sun. Mr. Fenton's \"We Own This City\" is the tale of the Gun Trace Task Force, founded in 2007 as a well-meaning initiative that would target the distributors and straw purchasers responsible for flooding Baltimore streets with guns. \"We were like one big unit,\" recalled Mr. Guinn, a founding member of the GTTF, \"and we went everywhere.\"</p><p>A few paragraphs into reading \"We Own This City,\" I had the distinct sensation that I'd read this story before. A quick search confirmed that sensation: The same events were the subject of \"I Got A Monster,\" by former Baltimore City Paper editor-in-chief Brandon Soderberg and freelance journalist Baynard Woods, published just seven months before Mr. Fenton's. Both books chronicle the rise and fall of a Baltimore police unit so riddled with corruption that several of its members are currently serving long prison sentences after multiple trials that began in 2017. Both rely on many of the same kinds of sources: direct interviews by the writers, court documents, transcripts of federal wiretaps, and other public records. Both let the narrative unfold and the actions of its principals (mostly) speak for themselves. But where \"I Got A Monster\" preoccupied itself with telling a fast-paced story of policing gone bad, \"We Own This City\" takes its time, unspooling the history of the Gun Trace Task Force. Mr. Fenton is after more than the portrait of a few malcontents.</p><p>From its inception, the Task Force's approach was supposed to be more measured and deliberate than the usual unsystematic approach to curbing violence, and for some time, it seemed to work: 268 guns were seized in the task force's first year from just 41 arrests. Then a new commander changed the GTTF's focus to more \"street rips\" -- arrests of individuals suspected of possessing illegal firearms -- and higher quotas, and the unit cut its personnel by more than half. And when BPD detective Wayne Jenkins moved into the unit, the possibility for graft and corruption increased by orders of magnitude.</p><p>Mr. Jenkins, as Mr. Fenton reports, was one of the more blatant examples of dirty cops firmly supported by the system. Complaints that he planted drugs, took money forfeited from drug seizures and committed physical assault led to civil lawsuits and criminal charges, but almost all resulted in acquittals. (One lawsuit did find Mr. Jenkins liable -- for a single dollar.) \"Nobody could tell him nothing,\" said one cop. \"He would not listen to anybody.\" Mr. Jenkins was the one doing the telling, \"like he would sit us down and have miniclasses, give us scenarios, see what we would do and show us how to do it and not get caught.\"</p><p>His colleagues feared him; he was paranoid (rightly, it would emerge) that his phone was being tapped, that federal agents were on to him. It made for a poisonous work environment, even if Mr. Jenkins had the reputation of being \"one of the best narcotics cops not [just] in the city but also the state.\" One cop got an ominous warning: \"Learn what you can, then get out of his squad. If you look around, he do some crazy s</p><p>---</p><p>. They protect him and leave the guys who work for him to the wolves.\" (The warning officer was Sean Suiter, whose mysterious death was officially classified an unsolved homicide.)</p><p>Mr. Jenkins had a way, according to a detective he once worked with, of asking suspects whom police should target next: \"If you was going to rob somebody, who would it be?\" The detective \"figured Jenkins was just trying to speak in the vernacular, but in hindsight, the framing of the question was telling.\" When one is primed for criminality, who better to engage than those with similar intents? Exploiting suspects' incentive to cooperate in hopes of catching a break, Mr. Jenkins could get leads that served for future busts -- or crimes of his own.</p><p>It would take years to set the trap that would take down Mr. Jenkins and the GTTF, catalyzed by a fluke tap of a different cop, and the additional, early involvement of the DEA. Though Mr. Fenton does detail what motivated Mr. Jenkins, and what prompted others who worked with him at BPD to supplement their legal income with ill-gotten gains, he does so in a way that offers explanation (a stillborn child, marital issues) without excuse. That is in keeping with the other strength of \"We Own This City\": It layers the downfall of the Gun Trace Task Force in the larger story of the relationship between the BPD and the city, locked in the toxic tango of racism and violence that erupted after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, leading to protests and unrest in the streets -- and a spike in homicides.</p><p>The breakdowns in trust and in value systems that led to Gray's death as part of an alleged \"rough ride\" -- a deliberately cruel practice in which cops drive vans containing shackled, unbuckled suspects in a lurching, spasmodic way that can lead to injuries -- are the same breakdowns that allowed a group of cops to pilfer drugs and money with impunity: privileging results over legality, papering over festering wounds without solving the actual problems, avoiding judicial oversight of law enforcement, and not listening to communities when they clamored for safe neighborhoods rather than shows of force.</p><p>\"We Own This City\" is a standout examination of the failures of policing, laid out in context with greater systemic failures. The trial of those on the GTTF, Mr. Fenton writes, \"had laid waste to what remained of the Baltimore Police Department's credibility. This wasn't a one-off, disputed incident or a case of one 'bad apple' -- the public had heard from officers themselves, who had come together into an elite and well-regarded unit, admitting to an array of pervasive misbehavior unobstructed for years by any systems designed to stop them.\"</p><p>I would go a step further than Mr. Fenton: The system might as well have been designed to promote rampant corruption of the kind exhibited by the Gun Trace Task Force. A system that values arrest quotas without checking to see if charges might actually stick, that encourages overtime billing for unworked hours, that promotes while ignoring police shootings of the unarmed, and does not adequately teach officers how to de-escalate conflict is a system that creates the seeds of criminality among those sworn to uphold the law.</p><p>The \"pressure . . . to produce\" that his colleague saw motivating and enabling Mr. Jenkins turns out to be at odds with building trust within the communities the police are supposed to keep safe. \"We Own This City\" is a sobering and necessary account of one dramatic way that trust was destroyed, but it is as much a damning indictment of how that destruction grew out of a mixture of negligence, incompetence and hubris. Protesting the presence of a few bad apples is easy. Reckoning with the tainted harvest will take dedicated work.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Weinman is the author of \"The Real Lolita\" and the editor of \"Unspeakable Acts: True Tales of Crime, Murder, Deceit and Obsession.\"</p>",
