  "text": "<p>Bricks and mortar retail is facing a make or break holiday season in western economies. Footfall, which rebounded sharply over the summer, is dropping back in the face of the Delta variant and frustration with long lines and empty shelves. Store visits remain down by a fifth or more from 2019 levels in both the UK and US.</p> <p>Yet young consumers in particular still want to go shopping. New US data from Accenture suggests 70 per cent of Gen Z customers plan to make most of their holiday purchases in store, while 54 per cent of Baby Boomers plan to buy largely online. Younger consumers are driven partly by fear of shortages — they would rather physically pick up items than risk shipping delays — but also by a desire to get out and do things with other people.</p> <p>That means brands and malls that lost ground to online sales last year have a vital chance to fight back. If they can provide positive in-person experiences and good customer service, they may be able to woo back younger customers.</p> <p>When mall group Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield surveyed European and UK customers, it found that they expected half of shopping space to be devoted to “experiences” rather than product sales, far more than the current share. So the company is trying to respond. Its malls have recently added posh minigolf, <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.lamag.com/digestblog/little-kitchen-academy/__;!!BupLon6U!5Vd4Z5CYX0zcMfSLcdfT-IfipBqxmH8HqXOaWPzKT-uqMdyB76nv3xVQBEwuAa5zRTfK1_0V$\">cooking classes for kids</a> and <a href=\"https://metrixfootball.com/\">virtual football</a>. Last month it hosted Lady Gaga's latest album launch with ticketed “fan zones” at 21 malls that drew 10,000 people.</p> <p>Stores are also springing up to capitalise on some of the most common gripes about online shopping: “inaccurate” recommendations and misleading pictures. Situ Live, which opened in Westfield London last week, is one of them. </p> <p>Last Saturday, the place felt like a cross between an Apple store and an Ikea showroom, staffed by energetic YouTube influencers. Staff showed off high-tech beds, induction cookers and virtual reality headsets, and then encouraged visitors to hop on and try for themselves. Rather than selling products itself, the store charges manufacturers a sponsorship fee and uses QR codes to send interested customers to the maker's website.</p> <p>Online retailers that profited mightily during the pandemic are well aware that competition is returning. Internet sales made up 25 per cent of total UK retail sales in August, the lowest level since the start of Covid-19. And clothing groups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cda44c7d-f386-4be2-b769-65133ce0d81a\">Asos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4904701-61bf-46c6-b6a6-311ce895767a\">Boohoo</a> recently warned that increased returns due to poor fit and supply chain issues would hit profits.</p> <p>Digital behemoths are beginning to hedge their bets, as they seek new revenue sources and closer ties to their customers. Amazon opened its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/393a6b27-31d2-412a-92da-6ebc1e743f8f\">first 4-star retail outlet outside the US</a> last week and is said to be considering department stores as well. China's JD.com just launched its first bricks and mortar mall in Xi'an. Google has been using its first store, which opened in New York in June, to learn what customers like and don't like about its Pixel phones and Nest thermostats.</p> <p>But hands on experiences and whizzy digital products are just the beginning. Stores must also find ways to make ordinary in-person shopping worth the trip, even as they struggle with staff and product shortages. </p> <p>Retailers can do that by offering services that are simply not replicable online. Swedish clothing group H&amp;M has long encouraged customers to <a href=\"https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/circular-and-climate-positive/recycling/\">bring in old clothes</a> for recycling — and a small store credit. </p> <p>Others are trying to capitalise on concerns about shipping delays and shortages by steering customers to click and collect programmes and hoping they pick up additional items while they are there as well.</p> <p>US retailer Target last week offered its first ever in-store October “deal days” accompanied by a promise to reimburse customers if their purchases are discounted closer to Christmas. The aim was to lure customers to stores while stocks are high and spread out the crowds, improving the shopping experience while reducing stress on employees.</p> <p>Getting this holiday season right will probably hit profit margins. Big retailers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/600b73e9-df2b-4748-8201-6ae8bb1213bf\">stocked up early this year</a>, driving up inventory and shipping costs, and tight labour markets are forcing chains to pay higher wages or offer steeper employee discounts to recruit seasonal staff.</p> <p>“Consumers have the power and you have to orient around pleasing them,” says Joel Bines of consultants AlixPartners. “This is going to affect your traditional profitability, but it's worth it because you stay relevant.”</p> <p>Shoppers will remember which stores had full shelves and short queues, and, more importantly, which ones did not.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:brooke.masters@ft.com\">brooke.masters@ft.com</a></p> <p><em>Follow Brooke Masters with&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/brooke-masters\"><em>myFT&#xa0;</em></a><em>and on&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brookeamasters\"><em>Twitter</em></a></p><p>Source: Brooke Masters 2021 'Will Gen Z save malls and stores from their online rivals?
