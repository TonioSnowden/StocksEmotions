  "title": "Cross Country:  Big Labor May Save New York From AOC's Socialism  ----  By Steven Malanga",
  "text": "<p>   When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her upset victory against Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley in 2018, she had the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America. What she lacked was a single endorsement from New York's powerful unions. Since then, candidates supported by the DSA have scored more wins against union-supported incumbents. As New York heads into an election cycle that will shape the politics of America's largest city for the next four years, unions and the DSA are on a collision course. </p><p>   New York's unions are a heterodox group, ranging from public-sector outfits like the United Federation of Teachers and District Council 37, which cherish the rich compensation they've won for members over the years, to more conservative trade unions like the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which benefit when the city's economy grows. Despite their sometimes divergent interests, these unions have always found enough common cause to become a central force in the city's Democratic coalition. But they were caught off guard by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's appeal, especially in gentrifying neighborhoods where recently arrived young progressives embraced her antiestablishment campaign. </p><p>   After her election, union leaders tried to play down their support for Mr. Crowley, arguing that they had little choice but to support an incumbent. \"You're constantly making pragmatic decisions about the relationships that you need to have if you're a union that relies on the government to assist with some of the things that you need for your members,\" Bob Master, local political director of the Communications Workers of America, told Jacobin magazine. \"Young radicals need to understand this.\" </p><p>   But if labor leaders expected young radicals to accept the way things worked, they were naive. Quickly, DSA officials began plotting to infiltrate local unions and overthrow their leadership. In August 2019 Politico New York published a DSA memo outlining a \"strategy for militant, democratic, classwide struggles\" that included stinging assessments of some unions. </p><p>   About the powerful United Federation of Teachers, DSA said: \"Simply put, it is tremendously influential politically, but fails to exercise the full potential of its power. Its strategy rests on electing fairly centrist/conservative Democrats.\" The New York Hotel Trades Council, with more than 35,000 members, \"seems to have shifted towards accommodation in its relations\" with management. A recent contract, the memo said, \"attempts to impose a suffocating and prolonged period of employer-friendly labor peace.\" </p><p>   The memo shattered any sense that DSA and labor were heading for conciliation. Vincent Alvarez, president of the New York Central Labor Council, a regional federation of 300 unions, blasted DSA for efforts \"to sow the seeds of disunity\" through \"infiltration and disruption.\" Richard Steier, editor of the Chief, a newspaper for government workers, wrote a piece headlined, \"Meet the New Left, Just as Daft as the Old Left,\" in which he described the DSA strategy as \"pie-in-the-sky.\" The head of the Hotel and Trades Council blasted the party for being \"primarily composed of middle-class white people.\" </p><p>   DSA leaders fought back, accusing the hotel union of enlisting members to make secret recordings of DSA meetings. </p><p>   The divisions remained apparent in 2020. DSA candidates for state legislative seats in New York City districts defeated incumbents endorsed by labor. In Brooklyn, insurgent candidates Jabari Brisport, a public-school teacher, and Phara Souffrant Forrest, a nurse, each failed to win the endorsements of their own unions, but managed to beat union-backed opponents. </p><p>   The stakes are higher in 2021's city elections. Though the DSA probably doesn't have enough clout to elect a mayor, some observers speculate the socialists could win as many as six City Council seats in gentrifying areas, creating a powerful bloc in the 51-member body dominated by progressive Democrats. The DSA has asked candidates to sign an antibusiness agenda that some union leaders fear will smother the city's economy. Among other items, the DSA advocates canceling all rent and mortgage payments incurred during the pandemic and taking government control of city utilities and broadband providers. </p><p>   Some union leaders blame Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for helping scuttle a deal to bring Amazon's second headquarters to Queens, which would have created 25,000 new jobs, including thousands of unionized construction jobs. On the day Amazon pulled out of the project after pressure from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other DSA politicians, she boasted on Twitter that the company's withdrawal shows \"anything is possible\" and thanked supporters for helping defeat \"Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation.\" Gary LaBarbera, head of the Building and Construction Trades Council, hit back: \"Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City's economy.\" He warned that his members \"will remember which legislators forgot about us.\" </p><p>   For some union leaders, the clash of visions is stark. \"The vast majority of union members pay dues to help ensure a better economic life for themselves and their families, not to strive for socialism,\" Mr. Steier observed in his 2019 piece. </p><p>   Having spent years helping to turn New York City blue, labor leaders now fear the Big Apple may end up red -- socialist red. They're right to worry. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Malanga is senior editor of City Journal. </p><p></p>",
