  "title": "House Democrats' Only Abortion Foe Is in a Tight Primary Runoff in Texas; Rep. Henry Cuellar says his opposition to abortion is rooted in faith, while his opponent backs 'unfettered access'",
  "text": "<p>National Democrats are watching the race as a test of how the abortion issue could affect voter turnout and races in the November election, when the party is defending its majorities in the House and Senate.</p><p>Politico's publication of a leaked draft opinion that suggested the Supreme Court was prepared to throw out precedent for a right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade has drawn new attention to the nine-term congressman's long-held stance, which he said is rooted in his faith.</p><p>\"I've never really had to address that issue, until recently,\" Mr. Cuellar said in an interview Friday. \"I'm a Catholic, don't believe in it, but should there be exceptions? Yeahâ€¦Should there be restrictions? Heck, yes.\"</p><p>Mr. Cuellar, 66, opposes Democratic federal legislation to codify the abortion rights outlined in the Roe v. Wade ruling. Ms. Cisneros supports federal money to make abortions more affordable and accessible.</p><p>Ms. Cisneros, a 28-year-old who interned for Mr. Cuellar, lost her challenge to him two years ago by fewer than 3,000 votes. In the March primary this year, she came within 767 votes, triggering the runoff this week.</p><p>The Republican candidates also are standing for a runoff election Tuesday: Cassy Garcia, a former staffer for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and Sandra Whitten, who lost to Mr. Cuellar two years ago by more than 19 percentage points.</p><p>Ms. Cisneros's path to the Democratic nomination depends on high turnout in the part of the district that stretches toward San Antonio, where voters tend to be more progressive. That includes Wilson County, where resident Diana Holcomb, 55, said she plans to vote for Ms. Cisneros after backing Mr. Cuellar in the past.</p><p>\"Now there is a choice, so I'm staying with choice,\" she said of why she was switching to vote for Ms. Cisneros. \"It's more about women's bodies. Why aren't men's bodies regulated?\"</p><p>Mr. Cuellar is working to win cities and towns along the border, in Laredo and communities like Rio Bravo that are traditionally Democratic and heavily Catholic.</p><p>Mr. Cuellar and Republicans have attacked Ms. Cisneros as being weak on border security. Ms. Cisneros has said she wants to carve up Immigration and Customs Enforcement and reassign its enforcement functions.</p><p>On the campaign trail Thursday, Mr. Cuellar drew friendly honks outside the Rio Bravo Meat Market in this community of nearly 5,000 where the median income is $23,431.</p><p>Mr. Cuellar reached into car windows of border patrol agents driving to work at the U.S.-Mexico border at the end of the street to shake hands.</p><p>Kevin Delgado, a 22-year-old butcher, ran out of the market in his apron to snap a photo with the congressman and say he would vote for him. Jose Luis, 40, who stocks the market's shelves, said he wasn't happy with his representation. \"Laredo's been the same since he got elected,\" he said.</p><p>Both men said abortion wasn't a deciding factor for them.</p><p>Laredo resident Hilda Rubio, age 69, ranks abortion rights as a top issue, but also said she was struggling with which Democrat would win her vote.</p><p>\"Abolish abortions and you end up with all these babies and children in orphanages,\" she said.</p><p>In Texas, physicians are banned from performing an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, at about six weeks, through a law passed last year that allows citizens to report violations. Should the 1973 Roe. v. Wade ruling be overturned, Texas has passed a trigger law to ban all abortions without exception poised to take effect.</p><p>Emily's List, which backs abortion rights, is spending $500,000 to run ads on television.</p><p>Neither the Spanish nor English version of the ad mentions abortion, instead using more general language that Mr. Cuellar is \"voting with MAGA Republicans against women's healthcare\" and noting his opposition to expanding overtime pay and a union-backed bill on labor organizing.</p><p>Laphonza Butler, Emily's List president, didn't respond directly to questions about the ad's omission of abortion, saying the group wanted the message to include a swath of issues.</p><p>Ms. Cisneros's campaign has been airing TV ads for weeks saying Mr. Cuellar is \"the lone Democrat against a woman's right to make her own decisions.\"</p><p>The race has split Democrats in Washington, part of an internal tug of war between progressive and more-centrist members.</p><p>Additionally, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cuellar's home and campaign office in January. The FBI has disclosed few details about the investigation, though Mr. Cuellar's attorney has said the congressman isn't a target.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) backs Mr. Cuellar. \"He is not pro-choice, but we didn't need him\" to pass legislation on abortion rights, she said.</p><p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) has campaigned for Ms. Cisneros, and Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) recently endorsed her, saying the Supreme Court leak shows \"we must elect pro-choice candidates that will fight to make sure abortion remains the law of the land.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) campaigned with Ms. Cisneros on Friday.</p><p>Republicans say they are eager for Ms. Cisneros to win the runoff, believing her progressive views could help flip the district in what may be a bad year for Democrats.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think the issue of abortion will play out in the Democratic primary runoff in Texas? Join the conversation below.</p><p>David Wasserman, of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said the prospect of Ms. Cisneros winning the primary was key in giving the district a \"toss-up rating,\" though President Biden's low approval with Hispanics and the FBI raid also contributed.</p><p>In Laredo, Annabella Ramirez, a 61-year-old retiree, said she plans to vote for Mr. Cuellar. If he doesn't win, she will vote for a Republican. She said she voted for former President Trump in 2020.</p><p>\"I don't support it because I'm Catholic,\" she said of abortion. But she added: \"It should be up to the mom, the lady, that's what I think.\"</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com</p><p>House Democrats' Only Abortion Foe Is in a Tight Primary Runoff in Texas</p>",
