  "title": "Hertz Hands Keys to Ex-Goldman Sachs Executive After Wild Pandemic Ride; Rental-car company taps Stephen Scherr to be its next CEO, succeeding interim chief Mark Fields",
  "text": "<p>He takes over a company that was a veritable bingo card of the pandemic economy. Hertz filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 after the falling value of its used-car fleet caused a debt crunch. It quickly became the original meme stock, cheered on by an army of retail traders—foreshadowing the Reddit-fueled mania around GameStop Corp. and others a year later.</p><p>And it turned out to be a surprise winner as the pandemic reshaped Americans' habits.</p><p>Far from evaporating, demand for rental cars heated up during the pandemic as many consumers avoided public transportation and relocated for long stretches of remote work. When a group of investment firms took over the company last June, stockholders received $8 a share—almost unheard-of in bankruptcies, which typically wipe out shareholders.</p><p>Hertz went public again in November and has a market value of about $9 billion, three times what it was before the pandemic hit.</p><p>Now the challenge for Mr. Scherr, 57 years old, who is expected to take over at the end of this month, is to clean up Hertz's notoriously bad customer service and make progress on partnerships it has struck to sell its cars via Carvana Co. and lease them to Uber Technologies Inc. drivers. One of Hertz's major owners, Certares Management, also owns American Express Co.'s corporate-travel business, a potential trove of data that a tech-savvier Hertz might tap.</p><p>Mr. Scherr joined Goldman in 1993 and rose as an investment banker, raising money for media and telecom companies. He oversaw the firm's push into Main Street banking and helped launch its Apple credit card, Goldman's first. He was named CFO in 2018.</p><p>He announced his resignation in September and, as his time at Goldman ticked down, joined the transition team of incoming New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat. He had been weighing a position in Mr. Adams's administration but began interviewing for the Hertz job after being recruited by a pair of former Goldman colleagues, who by then were working at hedge funds involved in the Hertz restructuring, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Goldman hasn't historically been a training ground for CEOs, unlike JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., whose senior executives have gone on to run big public companies. Most take jobs at investment firms or in government.</p><p>Alexander Gladstone contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com</p><p>Hertz Hands Keys to Ex-Goldman Sachs Executive After Wild Pandemic Ride</p>",
