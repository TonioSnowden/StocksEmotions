  "title": "EA Will Stand Fine Alone; 'Battlefield' misfire hurts, but Electronic Arts holds a diverse lineup that will keep business strong even as rivals get swallowed up in M&A wave",
  "text": "<p>Luckily, Battlefield is no Call of Duty. The blockbuster shooter from rival Activision Blizzard is on an annual release cycle and typically sells more than 20 million units a year. Analysts were expecting more like 10 million to 12 million units for the latest Battlefield, from a franchise that only sees a major release every two to three years. Hence, the resulting forecast cut amounted to a 1.3% trim. Much of Battlefield's weakness will likely be compensated for by strong performance of EA's sports titles as well as the popular online shooter game \"Apex Legends,\" which Wall Street expects to generate more than $1 billion in revenue this fiscal year for EA, according to consensus estimates by Visible Alpha.</p><p>The bigger question surrounding EA is how the company will fare in the consolidation wave sweeping the game sector. Last month, three major deal announcements occurred: Take-Two Interactive bidding $11 billion to buy Zynga, Sony's $3 billion pickup of Bungie and Microsoft's $69 billion proposal to buy Activision. The latter is most relevant for EA, because it would leave the company as the largest pure-play game publisher by annual revenue. It would also leave the company seemingly disadvantaged in a world in which major platform owners see game content as a crucial draw. Hence, the deal wave has set off speculation on who might go after EA.</p><p>Few really could. With a current market value around $38 billion, an offer for EA would need to be in the $60 billion range to reflect a 55% premium—the midpoint between the premiums offered for Zynga and Activision. That severely limits the field mostly to cash-rich, big tech platforms such as Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook-parent Meta—all of whom have powerful reasons to stay out of regulators' sights.</p><p>Some have speculated on Netflix, which is now dabbling in games and—thanks to a poorly received fourth-quarter report—might feel a need to change its story. But Netflix has never done a sizable deal; six acquisitions listed by FactSet don't even have transaction values attached. And the streaming giant is barely tipping back into being free-cash-flow positive, after spending years burning cash to build up its own content slate.</p><p>Also, any bidder with the scale and resources to make a play for EA will likely want to see how the Microsoft-Activision deal plays out with regulators. That deal will be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission, which has promised a tougher look at major tech transactions. That could stall any move for EA by months at least. But the company is doing just fine; its wide lineup of sports, action and mobile games diversifies its exposure, while properties such as \"FIFA,\" \"Madden NFL\" and \"Apex\" provide the hits to keep players coming back. Clay Griffin of MoffettNathanson wrote Wednesday that EA \"may have to execute its strategy as a party of one.\" There are worse things.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>EA Will Stand Fine Alone</p>",
