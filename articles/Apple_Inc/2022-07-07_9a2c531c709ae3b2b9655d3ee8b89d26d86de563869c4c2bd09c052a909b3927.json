  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Online advertising wasn't having a great year. But things are getting worse, and Wall Street may be underestimating just how much so. </p><p>\n  The combined weight of macroeconomic factors such as rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and growing inflation took some wind out of the online-ad market in the first quarter. And the situation has grown even more fraught since, with inflation jumping to a multidecade high in May. Snap Inc. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in late May that \"the macroeconomic environment has definitely deteriorated further and faster than we expected,\" causing the company to warn that revenue and pretax earnings for the second quarter were coming in below the forecast it gave a month earlier. </p><p>\n  That was an ominous sign halfway through the quarter, and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg closed the period with a similar sentiment. In an all-hands meeting with employees last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said the Facebook parent is slashing its engineer-hiring target for the year by 30%. He called the current state of affairs \"one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,\" according to a report by Reuters. Facebook's ad business dwarfs Snapchat's, and analysts expect advertising revenue at the social-media giant to show no growth on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter for the first time in the company's history. </p><p>\n  But Facebook isn't the only one feeling the pain. Combined advertising revenue for Meta and Google-parent Alphabet, along with Twitter, Snap, Pinterest and the ad segment of Amazon, is expected to rise 9% year over year to $97.2 billion in the second quarter, according to consensus estimates by FactSet. That is a notable slowdown from the 17% growth shown in the first quarter and would be the slowest growth since the second quarter of 2020, when the onset of pandemic lockdowns caused a sharp drop in advertising for travel and other key sectors. </p><p>\n  Individual results for all six of the aforementioned companies are expected to reflect the second-quarter slowdown, even though macroeconomic factors aren't weighing on all equally. Google's core search arm still makes up the bulk of its ad business and has so far proved more resilient than other segments. Thus, Google's total ad revenue for the second quarter is expected to increase 12% year over year to $56.7 billion. </p><p>\n  Facebook, by contrast, is still dealing with the impact of changes to Apple's iOS platform last year. And TikTok's growing clout may also be taking a bigger bite. In a report last week, eMarketer projected that TikTok's global ad revenue will top $11.6 billion this year -- up 200% from last year and surpassing Snap, Twitter and Pinterest in overall size. TikTok competes with Google's YouTube, which is expected to show ad revenue growth slowing to 8% year over year in the second quarter after averaging 42% over the last four quarters. </p><p>\n  Wall Street expects ad growth to pick back up in the second half of the year. But with more executives and experts predicting a recession on the horizon, that prospect looks increasingly dicey. And the modern online-ad industry's resilience in a sustained global recession has yet to be truly tested. </p><p>\n  In a report last week, J.P. Morgan's Doug Anmuth noted that digital advertising accounted for about 12% of total ad spending in the financial crisis of 2008-09. That compares with 67% last year, \"making online spend now far more exposed to broader macro trends,\" he wrote. This time, the industry will need to pick up more than a few clicks to recover. </p><p></p>",
