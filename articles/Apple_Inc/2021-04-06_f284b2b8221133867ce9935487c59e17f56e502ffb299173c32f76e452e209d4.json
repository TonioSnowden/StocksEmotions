  "text": "<p>And we take a look at Hitachi Ltd .'s purchase of GlobalLogic Inc ., a deal that amounts to a big bet on helping heavy industry go digital.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>SoftBank bet. SoftBank Group Corp . agreed to pay $2.8 billion for a 40% stake in AutoStore, whose technology makes it possible for warehouses to be operated almost entirely by robots, WSJ reports.</p><p>AutoStore is controlled by Thomas H. Lee Partners LP , while another private-equity firm, Sweden's EQT AB , holds a minority stake. The deal values the company at $7.7 billion including debt, the companies said Monday.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported such a deal was imminent earlier Monday. SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been placing big bets on artificial intelligence and internet-connected devices for years, famously predicting in 2017 that super smart robots will outnumber humans within 30 years.</p><p>21%</p><p>A Biden proposal would impose a 21% minimum tax on U.S. companies' foreign income. (WSJ)</p><p>Coinbase Independent Directors Have Close Company Ties</p><p>Fred Ehrsam 's ties to Coinbase Global Inc . run deep: He co-founded the multibillion-dollar bitcoin exchange, was its president until 2017, owns millions of its shares and was part-owner of a company it bought last year, WSJ reports. Under Coinbase 's plan to tap the public markets, however, the San Francisco-based company classifies Mr. Ehrsam as an independent director, securities filings show. The same goes for Fred Wilson , another Coinbase director who owns a significant stake of the company. That independent label allows Coinbase , the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, to assign Messrs. Ehrsam and Wilson to an investor-protection role that is required for every public company. Mr. Ehrsam and Mr. Wilson didn't respond to requests for comment. Coinbase is restricted in what it can say publicly ahead of its listing, which is expected on April 14. The prospectus for its offering says its board has determined that Messrs. Ehrsam and Wilson meet the regulatory definition of independent directors.</p><p>Why Hitachi Is Spending $9.6 Billion to Dive Into the Software Business</p><p>Hitachi Ltd . 's $9.6 billion purchase of digital-engineering firm GlobalLogic Inc . amounts to a big bet that enterprise software will unleash the power of big data on heavy industry, WSJ reports. The Japanese manufacturing giant follows a string of other old-guard hardware businesses that are investing in fast-growing enterprise-software development, analysts say. Best-known years ago for TV sets, video recorders and batteries, Hitachi is diving headfirst into this area as coronavirus restrictions have all but shoved industries into digitizing their businessesâ€”faster. That's where Hitachi hopes to employ GlobalLogic's engineering know-how in manufacturing, energy and other sectors to expand further outside Japan, said Gajen Kandiah, chief executive of Hitachi Vantara, the firm's digital infrastructure segment.</p><p>New Money</p><p>Sendbird Inc., a San Mateo, Calif.-based mobile engagement and communication platform, closed a $100 million Series C round.
