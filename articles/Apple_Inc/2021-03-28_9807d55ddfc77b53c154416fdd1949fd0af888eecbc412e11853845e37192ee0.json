  "text": "<p>If you could set up a winery anywhere in the world, where would you do it? In sun-baked Tuscany? On a grassy hillside in Sonoma? Or&#xa0;how about a railway arch in Battersea, south London? Because that's where you'll find Blackbook – a winery that's fast emerging as one of the most exciting in the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/022d88ce-c211-48c7-b78c-a10ffd03fa71\">English wine </a>scene.</p> <p>Neither of Blackbook's founders are from London, or even England for that matter. Winemaker Sergio Verrillo, 40,&#xa0;grew up in&#xa0;Connecticut, the son of&#xa0;Italian&#xa0;and Hungarian immigrants. He moved to London in the 2000s to work as&#xa0;a sommelier at Gordon Ramsay's Maze and Chez Bruce, before retraining as a winemaker in 2010. His wife Lynsey was born in Aberdeenshire and raised&#xa0;in Edinburgh.</p> <p>But when it came to establishing Blackbook, the pair knew it was London or bust: “We&#xa0;are both city people – we are passionate about this city,” says Verrillo. “We love its vibrancy, its energy and its culture, and we try to reflect that in our wines.”</p> <p>London is home to four wineries: Blackbook, London Cru and Vagabond in the south-west, and Renegade in the east. What makes Blackbook different to some of its peers is the fact that the winery only uses English fruit. Most of&#xa0;that comes from Essex, and all of it from vineyards within a two-hour radius of London. Verrillo's big loves are Pinot Noir and Chardonnay – varietals he&#xa0;got to know well while serving apprenticeships at&#xa0;Flowers in Sonoma, Burgundy's De Montille and Ata Rangi in New Zealand. His wines would be classed as “natural” by some – the wines are fermented with wild yeasts and bottled unfiltered with minimal sulphur – but they also&#xa0;have purity and polish.</p> <p>“Their Chardonnays are world class,” says Gus Gluck, founder of <a href=\"http://www.qualitywinesfarringdon.com/\">Quality Wines</a> in Farringdon and <a href=\"https://www.gbwineshippers.co.uk/\">GB Wine Shippers</a>. “They have a structural quality, a diamond-like texture, that reminds me of exciting Chablis. They're the first still English wines I've tasted that you could really lay down.” &#xa0;</p> <p>The 2019 Painter of Light, made with grapes from Clayhill in Essex, is luminous – citrusy, with a touch of salt. The 2018 Pygmalion Chardonnay has more oaky power – Bramley apple, brandy butter – that will&#xa0;probably produce a more profound wine in the long run.</p> <p>One of my favourite rosés of last summer was Blackbook's 2018 I'd Rather be a Rebel Pinot Noir; the 2019 (launching at the end of April) is leaner but it's got wonderful vigorous crunch: raspberry, rose, pink grapefruit and a fine, structured tannin.</p> <p>Blackbook's striking labels (all by the <a href=\"https://yarzatwins.com/\">Yarza Twins</a> studio in Whitechapel) are a homage to the city – one quotes a tile pattern from Tate Britain, another a florette from the Royal Opera House. The label on the white blend The Mix Up was inspired by Warren Street Tube station. And the winery has grown into a hub for the local community. “All around us are small businesses – distilleries, wine merchants, craft brewers, food companies,” says Verrillo. “We've hosted supper clubs and drink festivals, we're collaborating on a beer with the nearby Mondo brewery, and we're doing a vermouth. Every harvest we welcome dozens of volunteers to work in the winery. That ability to reach out to people and do fun things is a big part of why we love being in London.” &#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.blackbookwinery.com/\"><em>blackbookwinery.com</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/alicelascelles\"><em>@alicelascelles</em></a></p><p>Source: Alice Lascelles 2021 'Chablis on Thames: the rise of the urban winery' FT.com 28 March.
