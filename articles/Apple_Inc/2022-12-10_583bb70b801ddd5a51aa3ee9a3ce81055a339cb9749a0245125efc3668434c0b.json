  "text": "<p>\n  The story of Moise de Camondo perfectly fits artist and writer Edmund de Waal's intuitive understanding of the world as it once was. \"Letters to Camondo\" takes the form of a series of imaginary letters from the author to the great but unremembered art collector of the title. A cosmopolitan Turkish Jew, Moise de Camondo knew everyone who was anyone in Paris at the end of the 19th century. An unstoppable collector of things made by the greatest French craftsmen and artists, he built a house to show it all off. He had a daughter, Beatrice, and a son, Nissim. In 1917, Nissim volunteered to be a pilot, was often in combat and mentioned in dispatches only to be shot down and killed. A broken Camondo gave his house and collections to the nation, and ever since there seems to be no interest in the family. He died just in time to avoid being murdered, along with his daughter and grandchildren, in Auschwitz. Edmund de Waal's book is a powerful, indeed beautiful, requiem for the forgotten. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Pryce-Jones is the author, most recently, of \"Openings &amp; Outings: An Anthology.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Vivek Ramaswamy </p><p>\n  The emerging religiosity in the climate-change debate obscures the diversity of questions at issue. Are global surface temperatures indeed rising to problematic levels? Are human beings principally responsible for this effect, and can they reasonably reverse it by altering their behaviors? Steven E. Koonin, in \"Unsettled\" (2021), has shown that the answers to these questions are far more complicated than we've been led to believe. Bjorn Lomborg has recently shown that rising global surface temperatures are likely not the unmitigated evil so many assume. The brilliance of Alex Epstein's recent \"Fossil Future\" is that he writes not as a scientific expert but as a philosopher. Mr. Epstein delivers clarity of thought in a way that only an outsider can. He concedes that man-made climate change is real, but he recenters the debate around the question that matters: What is the best course of action to improve human flourishing? His answer is clear and unapologetic: more plentiful, reliable, abundant access to fossil fuels. The climate-disaster-related death rate, he points out, is 98% lower today than it was just a century ago -- largely owing to innovations powered by fossil fuels. The right way to handle climate change isn't to reverse it but to master its effects -- a thesis that is as provocative as it is intuitive. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Ramaswamy is the author of \"Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Moshe Safdie </p><p>\n  Moshe Halbertal and Stephen Holmes's \"The Beginning of Politics\" examines the biblical Book of Samuel's political and psychological intricacies and demonstrates it to be the first insight into the complexity of sovereignty and government. I reread Robert Fagles's translation of \"The Odyssey\" during the Covid-19 lockdown. Fifty years after first reading Homer's epic poem, I returned to it with a broadened perspective, and consumed it as if watching a film -- I found it more dramatic, and certainly more imaginative, than any space fantasy I have seen. \"Memoirs of Hadrian,\" by Marguerite Yourcenar, reflects on statesmanship, leadership, ambition, and the potential and limits of power. Richard Saul Wurman's epic publication \"The Notebooks and Drawings of Louis I. Kahn\" (1962) expressed Kahn's method, philosophy and poetic words. Recently republished, along with new anecdotes, photographs, and essays, the book shows why Kahn's stature as one of the great American architects stands firm. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Safdie is the author of \"If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Bozoma Saint John </p><p>\n  In February, I made a big, scary change in my life. I left my role as the chief marketing officer of Netflix without another job lined up. It came after more than two decades of breakneck-speed career climbing at Endeavor, Uber, Apple and Pepsi. And suddenly, I stopped. It was the perfect time to pick up a book written by one of my best friends, Luvvie Ajayi Jones's \"Professional Troublemaker: The Fear-Fighter Manual.\" The book embodies the audacity we often need when we make the tough but right decision in life. I've been a disruptor in many spaces, and haven't been afraid to shake things up. But sometimes, we all need to borrow a little courage to do things differently. This book helped me do just that. As I prepare to publish my memoir, I've taken lessons from Luvvie's book to get ready to step into my new chapter and cause \"good trouble.\" </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Saint John's memoir \"The Urgent Life: My Story of Love, Loss, and Survival\" will be published in February. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Maria Salazar </p><p>\n  In 1991, I was Central America's bureau chief at Univision, the most prominent network for Latin Americans in the United States. I covered the civil war in El Salvador, where the FMLN guerrillas used extreme violence against the state. Javier Zamora's childhood memoir, \"Solito,\" details his 3,000-mile journey alone from El Salvador to the United States. Reading about El Salvador brought back memories of the war, where ultimately my life was threatened. I sought protection at the American Embassy. My trust in America as a safe haven was instinctive -- a blessing that I never questioned. Heart-wrenching and beautifully detailed, Mr. Zamora's story feels too heavy to have been repeated by anyone else. Truthfully, the U.S. holds millions of untold stories just like this one. Everyone should know what I knew in 1991 -- that America is both a refuge for those escaping violence and persecution, and fertile ground for hard-working immigrants with dreams of a better life. \"Solito\" is an unfinished story. </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Salazar is a congresswoman from Florida. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Surbhi Sarna </p><p>\n  I've always used books to either better understand my current reality or escape it, and 2022 was no different. As I transitioned from being an entrepreneur to a venture capitalist focused on biology, I wanted to better understand how innovation in health care can go wrong. \"Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty,\" by Patrick Radden Keefe, tells the terrifying story of how one family's greed contributed to, and may have caused, the opioid crisis in the U.S. I also reread \"Bad Blood,\" by John Carreyrou, which pieces together the rise and fall of Theranos. It reminded me of the importance of keeping health entrepreneurs focused on the patients they ultimately serve. When I was done scaring myself, I turned to lighter reading. Andrew Shvarts's \"It Ends in Fire\" is about a strong heroine who becomes an undercover spy at a school that teaches magic as she plots revenge on the system that destroyed her family. Oh, 2022, what a year, and I'm grateful for the books that helped me get through it. </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Sarna is a group partner at Y Combinator and the author of \"Without a Doubt: How to Go From Underrated to Unbeatable.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Lionel Shriver </p><p>\n  Ever since researching my own fictional contribution to the field, \"Game Control\" (1994), I've been fascinated by demography, whose inputs (longevity, women's rights, disease, little stuff like what people see as the meaning of life) are as complex as its outputs (political power, war, economic success, little stuff like whether we thrive or implode as a species). If you're interested in how this century is apt to play out, I recommend two highly readable books that I devoured in quick succession: Edward Paice's \"Youthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World\" and Paul Morland's \"Tomorrow's People: The Future of Humanity in Ten Numbers.\" While Southeast Asia, Europe and even China dwindle, by 2100 arid Africa's population is almost certain to exceed 4 billion. From either liberalism or cowardice Mr. Paice won't touch the scary subject with a barge pole, but he lays out stats that surely translate into mass African migration into Europe, which is bound to make the crisis of 2015 look like a school field trip. Mr. Morland addresses this prospect more honestly, while reserving judgment. Top off your reading with Douglas Murray's courageous \"The Strange Death of Europe,\" which suggests this future appeals to most Europeans like a hole in the head. My literary triptych augurs that trouble awaits. </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Shriver is the author, most recently, of the essay collection \"Abominations.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Ed Stack </p><p>\n  I love the saying \"It takes 20 years to make an overnight success.\" Many people don't realize how long it takes to become successful. \"The Ride of a Lifetime\" by Robert Iger and \"Play Nice but Win\" by Michael Dell help put the journey into perspective. For Mr. Iger, succeeding Michael Eisner as CEO of Disney was a challenge. Whether standing up to his predecessor or the Disney family, he was resolute in his vision. I can't wait to see how he navigates his next chapter as he shifts back to the CEO position. I was inspired by Mr. Dell's story of how, as a college kid with a passion for computers, he started a business. Like Mr. Iger, Mr. Dell never let his vision be dimmed by those around him who suggested he take a more traditional path. From the battle with Carl Icahn to take the company private to taking it public again, along with his acquisition strategy, he was definitely playing to win. Both books resonated deeply with my own experiences and are valuable for anyone trying to understand the importance of seeing around corners, stay- ing true to your vision and never giving up. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Stack is executive chairman of Dick's Sporting Goods. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Morgan Talty </p><p></p>",
