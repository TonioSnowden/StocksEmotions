  "title": "Gett Reaches $1.1 Billion SPAC Merger to Go Public; Company joins with ride-hailing operators to organize transportation options into one platform for corporate customers",
  "text": "<p>London-based Gett is combining with Rosecliff Acquisition Corp. I, a SPAC backed by the investment firm Rosecliff Venture Management LLC. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the two sides were nearing an agreement.</p><p>Gett is marketing itself as a practical solution for global companies to transport workers rapidly, particularly with many still working from home at least part-time during the coronavirus pandemic. The company now works with roughly a quarter of Fortune 500 companies, including Apple Inc. and Coca-Cola Co.</p><p>\"It's prime time for the unique solution Gett has,\" Chief Executive Dave Waiser said.</p><p>The merger would mark a new step in Gett's attempt to refocus its operations after closing its New York ride-sharing business Juno in 2019. Several years earlier, Mr. Waiser said it would eventually offer services such as on-demand manicures, housecleaning and pizza delivery.</p><p>At one point in 2019, the company was valued at about $1.5 billion and had raised several hundred million dollars in funding, including a roughly $300 million investment from auto maker Volkswagen AG.</p><p>Gett still operates ride-hailing services in markets such as Israel and London, but roughly 40% of its trips for corporate clients now come from third parties.</p><p>The SPAC deal would add to a string of blank-check mergers tied to the future of transportation. Southeast Asian ride-hailing and app operator Grab Holdings Inc. announced a roughly $40 billion megadeal in March, while Dubai-based Swvl Inc. said this summer it was valued at about $1.5 billion in its SPAC combination. Many other startups tied to electric vehicles, batteries, self-driving cars and flying taxis have also undertaken SPAC mergers in recent years.</p><p>Such deals are popular alternatives to traditional initial public offerings, in part because they allow early-stage companies to make business projections that aren't allowed in IPOs. Startups can often also raise large sums of cash in SPAC deals.</p><p>As part of the combination with the Rosecliff SPAC, Gett is expected to raise a roughly $30 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE. PIPE investors are expected to include the SPAC creators and existing Gett investors. The Rosecliff SPAC has about $250 million on hand, though that total could shrink if investors withdraw money before the deal closes.</p><p>A SPAC is a shell company that raises money and lists on a stock exchange with the intent of merging with a private company such as Gett to take it public. After it announces a deal, the startup releases detailed financial information and regulators then review the merger. Once it closes, the private company replaces the SPAC in the stock market.</p><p>Rosecliff Venture Management has invested in several other startups through its various funds, including sneaker company Allbirds Inc., mattress seller Casper Sleep Inc. and private-jet charter firm Wheels Up Experience Inc., which went public through a SPAC deal.</p><p>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</p><p>Gett Reaches $1.1 Billion SPAC Merger to Go Public</p>",
