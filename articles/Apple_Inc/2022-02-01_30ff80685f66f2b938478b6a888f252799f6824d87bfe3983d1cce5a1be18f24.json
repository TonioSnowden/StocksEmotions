  "text": "<p>\"You constantly need new content,\" said Michael Nathanson, an analyst for MoffettNathanson. Streaming services not only have to build vast libraries of old shows and movies, he said, they also \"need a couple big, nice theatrical movies every quarter to make it feel like it's really valuable.\"</p><p>Major releases have been a reliable driver of streaming subscriptions, particularly for newer services. Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+, for instance, won far more new U.S. subscribers when the musical \"Hamilton\" came out than any other day since early 2020, when the service was still getting off the ground.</p><p>AT&amp;T Inc.'s HBO Max saw a jump in U.S. sign-ups when \"Wonder Woman 1984\" was released on Christmas Day 2020, according to Antenna data. The same happened for Apple Inc.'s Apple TV+ on the day \"Greyhound,\" a World War II movie starring Tom Hanks, came out in July 2020.</p><p>Many of the new subscribers don't stick around long. About half of U.S. viewers who signed up within three days of the release of \"Hamilton,\" \"Wonder Woman 1984\" and \"Greyhound\" were gone within six months, Antenna data show.</p><p>Disney, Apple and AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia, the parent of HBO Max, declined to comment.</p><p>Even if streaming services retain only half of the users they sign up during big bursts, that still translates into sizable numbers of longer-term subscribers.</p><p>All streaming services see a portion of U.S. customers unsubscribe every month and have been signing up more users than they lose over time. But viewers who join a service right after a big release tend to leave significantly faster than the average streaming customer, according to an analysis of Antenna data.</p><p>Comcast Corp.'s Peacock, another service that entered the streaming arena in the past couple of years, saw a surge of U.S. sign-ups during last summer's Tokyo Olympic Games, for which it had streaming rights. Four months later, about half of the U.S. customers who had joined around the beginning of the Games were gone, Antenna data show.</p><p>Comcast's NBCUniversal unit, the parent of Peacock, declined to comment. Comcast said last week that more than nine million people were paying to watch Peacock, on top of an additional seven million cable and broadband customers of Comcast and other providers who get the service free and are using it regularly.</p><p>Antenna is able to compile daily subscriber sign-ups to most streaming services by aggregating data coming from a series of third-party apps that help users manage their email inboxes or keep to a monthly budget. Such apps keep track of streaming-related transactions and emails confirming users' decisions to sign up for or cancel a streaming subscription.</p><p>From a sample of five million U.S. users, Antenna extrapolates to build its projections, similar to what pollsters or other measurement companies such as Nielsen do. Antenna said users of those apps opt in to having their data used anonymously.</p><p>Antenna doesn't track subscriber sign-ups for Amazon's Prime Video because many subscribers join Prime for other Amazon benefits.</p><p>Streamers' challenges are exacerbated by the fact that most services are available through a monthly subscription, making it easy for viewers to cancel when they are done binge-watching a show.</p><p>The proliferation of streaming services has given users an array of options. HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Apple TV+ and Discovery Inc.'s Discovery+ have entered the field since 2019, while ViacomCBS Inc. has rebranded and expanded its CBS All Access service, now known as Paramount+. All are fighting for market share with more established players including Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video and Disney-controlled Hulu.</p><p>U.S. households subscribed to 3.6 streaming services on average last year, according to Kagan, a media research group within S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. The U.S. subscriber base of Netflix, the country's largest streaming service, has plateaued in recent quarters, MoffettNathanson data show.</p><p>When it reported fourth-quarter results on Jan. 20, Netflix said it might be affected by growing competition, adding that it continues to grow in regions where competitors have launched. The company's operating profit for the quarter shrank to 8.2% from 14.4% a year earlier.</p><p>Netflix attributed the decrease partly to its larger programming lineup compared with the year-earlier period, when Covid-19 shut down some production. Netflix's stock plunged by 22% after it forecast a significantly lower number of subscriber additions for the first quarter than it added a year ago, despite coming off a string of hit shows and movies.</p><p>\"The cost to build, the cost to market and the cost to retain customers will all be going up in a competitive market,\" Mr. Nathanson said.</p><p>Streaming services spent about twice as much on content -- both to create originals and acquire the rights to old movies and shows -- last year than they did in 2017, according to projections from Ampere Analysis, a research firm. Netflix alone planned to spend $17 billion on content last year, the company said in April.</p><p>More-established services with larger libraries of content have shown higher subscriber-retention rates than new entrants.</p><p>\"We always say that library titles tend to increase engagement and minimize churn,\" Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek said during a conference call with analysts in November, referring to the rate at which customers unsubscribe. \"But new titles, new content, whether they're movies or series, actually add new [subscribers.]\"</p><p>Netflix experienced a large influx of new customers in the first few weeks of the pandemic in March 2020, when lockdowns left many people with more time to watch shows such as \"Tiger King\" from the couch.</p>",
