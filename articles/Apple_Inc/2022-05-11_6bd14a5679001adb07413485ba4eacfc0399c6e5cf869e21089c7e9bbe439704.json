  "title": "New Pixel Phones, Watch, Buds and Tablet: Google Tries the Apple Playbook; The all-new smartwatch, which features Fitbit's health tracking capabilities, ships this fall, while Google's AirPods Pro competitor hits shelves in July",
  "text": "<p>The long-anticipated Pixel Watch smartwatch will go on sale this fall, along with the next-generation Pixel 7 and 7 Pro smartphones. Next year, Google will add a large-screen Pixel tablet to the family. The company also teased a prototype for augmented-reality glasses that translate spoken conversations in real time, but it didn't promise a ship date or any other availability.</p><p>I'm a big fan of Pixel smartphones because they run clean versions of Android, unencumbered by bloatware often found in other Android smartphones. They also come with mind-boggling AI-powered features that put Apple's Siri and Samsung's Bixby to shame.</p><p>Google's devices make up just 2% of the North American smartphone market, according to analytics company Statcounter. It's tough to convert Apple and Samsung loyalists. The Pixel minority is growing, though: Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president of devices and services, said in a pre-briefing that the often out-of-stock Pixel 6 and 6 Pro were the fastest-selling Pixels ever, and he blamed global supply-chain problems for not having even more to sell.</p><p>The latest Pixel drop goes beyond the phone.</p><p>There's a lot riding on the Pixel Watch, the fruits of Google's roughly $2.1 billion acquisition of wearables maker Fitbit. No Android wearable has come close to overtaking the Apple Watch's 30% slice of the global smartwatch market, according to Counterpoint Research. (Samsung, in second, accounts for 10%, while Fitbit has just 3.8%.) Perhaps the Pixel Watch, which combines the Google Assistant's smarts with Fitbit's health and fitness tracking, can turn things around.</p><p>Here's what we know about the new Pixel devices, and when they'll be released.</p><p>Pixel Watch</p><p>The Pixel Watch, which runs Google's Wear OS software, is coming out this fall. It's compatible with Pixels and other Android phones (but not iPhones), and features a round display in a stainless-steel encasing with a dial on the side.</p><p>The company showed previews of the watch's Google Assistant voice capabilities and smart-home control. A cellular option can provide phone-less connectivity to apps such as Google Maps and messaging. The watch has a heart-rate sensor and GPS, and is water-resistant up to 50 meters.</p><p>More details, including price, will be announced later this year. Mr. Osterloh said to expect \"deep integration with Fitbit\" software, including insights into heart rate and sleep, and described it as a \"premium-price product.\" Samsung's Galaxy Watch4 starts at $250, and the entry-level Apple Watch SE costs $279.</p><p>Fitbit data collected through the Pixel watch will stay separate from Google's other data collecting, per agreements with regulatory bodies.</p><p>Pixel Buds Pro</p><p>At $199, the Pixel Buds Pro are a premium addition to Google's earbuds lineup, which includes the $179 Pixel Buds and $99 Pixel Buds A-series. They feature active noise cancellation, as well as a transparency mode to let outside sounds in. The battery is rated for 7 hours with ANC and 11 hours without. The case can be wirelessly charged.</p><p>The earbuds can be connected to multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously. Mr. Osterloh said they feature intelligent audio switching for seamless transitions between, for example, listening to a podcast on your phone to turning into a video call on your laptop. This is a notoriously hard problem to solve—and I'm looking forward to testing it.</p><p>Another feature worth a try: active in-ear pressure relief, developed to fix the pressurized \"ear suck\" sensation some people get when wearing headphones.</p><p>Like the other Buds models, the Pros have hands-free Google Assistant capabilities. They are also IPX4 water-resistant (translation: splashes are OK, pool dives aren't), so they're suitable for workouts. The earbuds will be available for preorder on July 21 and hit stores July 28. Later this year, Pixel Buds Pro will support spatial audio, an immersive, three-dimensional audio experience.</p><p>Pixel 6a, 7 and 7 Pro Phones</p><p>There's good news for those with smaller hands. The 6.1-inch Pixel 6a is a downsized version of the massive Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. It costs $449, about $150 less than the 6.4-inch Pixel 6.</p><p>The battery also is a bit smaller, there's no wireless charging and the dual rear camera is slightly inferior. But the 6a does come with the Google-designed custom Tensor chip found in the pricier phones, as well as their Live Translate and car-crash detection features. The phone supports Wi-Fi 6e connectivity and 5G, with the faster millimeter-wave flavor supported on select models.</p><p>Google also offered a preview of its coming premium phones, the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, due this fall. The rear camera housing on both has an aluminum finish, and the 7 Pro will have a triple camera system similar to its predecessor. They'll include the next generation of the Tensor chip and ship with the upcoming Android 13.</p><p>Pixel Tablet</p><p>We don't know much about the Pixel tablet yet. It will run on Google's Tensor chip and is intended as a companion to the Pixel phone. \"It's more of a premium-style product and on the larger side,\" Mr. Osterloh said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your first impression of the new Pixel products?</p><p>\"The Android team has been making big advancements in tablet software,\" he said. The new large-screen device will be the \"most intelligent tablet in the world.\"</p><p>Tablet-optimized apps haven't been as widely available on Android devices as on the iPad, which owns about 50% of the market globally. My hunch? Google is teasing the tablet early to garner developer interest. My own hope? That the Pixel tablet has a Chrome interface—maybe just a desktop Chrome browser app—and a keyboard accessory so it can be used for both work and play.</p><p>AR Glasses Prototype</p><p>At the end of the two-hour presentation—which included a live audience in Mountain View, Calif.—the company teased a prototype that translated text onto a pair of glasses' lenses. A video showed a mother speaking in Mandarin to her daughter, who could read an English translation on-screen, like live subtitles.</p><p>—For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter .</p><p>Write to Nicole Nguyen at nicole.nguyen@wsj.com</p><p>New Pixel Phones, Watch, Buds and Tablet: Google Tries the Apple Playbook</p>",
