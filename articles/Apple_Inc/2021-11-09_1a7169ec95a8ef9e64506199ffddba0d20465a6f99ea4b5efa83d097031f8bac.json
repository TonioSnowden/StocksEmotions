  "text": "<p>Originally eight people were to be tried. But last Monday five pleaded guilty. That left Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai, pro-democracy activist Gwyneth Ho and Chow Hang-tung, former vice chairwoman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. The Alliance has been the lead organizer of Hong Kong's June 4 commemorations. </p><p>In 2020 when Hong Kong police declared the vigil unauthorized, it invoked public health concerns about the coronavirus. But the real goal has always been to erase June 4 from public memory by making the massacre as verboten in Hong Kong as it is on the mainland. Ms. Chow spoke for many in Hong Kong when she said at the opening of her trial that \"mourning is not a crime.\" </p><p>These prosecutions are not the only sign. The Hong Kong Alliance disbanded in September after police accused it of being \"an agent of foreign forces.\" Police raided a now-closed June 4 museum run by the Alliance. The University of Hong Kong recently ordered removed from its campus a sculpture honoring the Chinese massacred in the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. </p><p>By refusing to plead guilty and go quietly, these three now on trial in Hong Kong have done their part to force public discussion of June 4. They do so to keep its memory alive in the one corner of China where, until now, the truth could still be spoken.</p><p>Beijing's Memory Control in Hong Kong</p>",
