  "text": "<p>US Treasury prices fell sharply on Monday in a bearish start to 2022 that follows the worst year for the global bond market in more than two decades. </p> <p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose by nearly 0.13 percentage points, exceeding 1.6 per cent for the first time since the emergence in late November of the Omicron strain of coronavirus, which sent yields tumbling. It marked one of the biggest Treasury sell-offs over the past year.</p> <p>The yield on the policy sensitive two-year note briefly rose above 0.8 per cent, its highest level since March 2020. The moves accompanied a dramatic shift by traders on Monday, as they bet on tighter policy from the Federal Reserve in the years ahead.</p> <p>In stocks, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.6 per cent to close at a record high. The US benchmark was lifted by a surge in Tesla shares, after the carmaker reported blowout production numbers. A rally in shares of Apple, which pushed the iPhone maker's market capitalisation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57f57303-82b9-49db-89ee-54888e1c714d?emailId=61d344d12d401b00044f0d64&amp;segmentId=3d08be62-315f-7330-5bbd-af33dc531acb\">to $3tn</a>, also boosted the index. </p> <p>But the gains were not that widespread, with half of the stocks in the benchmark falling in value.</p> <p>The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index closed 0.5 per cent higher, having reached a record intraday high on light volume. Germany's Dax and the Cac 40 in Paris both rose 0.9 per cent. Exchanges in London, Japan and mainland China were closed for holidays. </p> <p>Monday's market moves followed the worst year for global bonds <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d11b596-7c0b-453b-a61f-9295d4103634\">since 1999</a> after central banks signalled that they were prepared to combat inflation pressures with interest rate rises. The withdrawal of stimulus that powered a global economic recovery has so far had only a modest effect on equities, with the S&amp;P 500 plateauing at the end of 2021 but still gaining 27 per cent for the year. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 finished 2021 up 22 per cent.</p> <p>A survey on the US manufacturing sector, due for publication on Tuesday, along with the monthly jobs report on Friday, will provide clues on whether investors are right to be anticipating at least three quarter point interest rate rises by the Fed this year.</p> <p>“With speculative spirits high, investors will need to gauge return per unit of risk as volatility reappears,” said Sean Darby, an analyst at Jefferies. “Perhaps equity investors should be more concerned that policymakers might get boxed in by trying to tame inflation with higher rates without upsetting asset markets.”</p> <p>Among Monday's biggest movers, Tesla surged more than 13 per cent after the carmaker negotiated supply-chain disruption to report <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad6d68b0-0171-4f24-9076-d778babf6fed\">forecast-beating deliveries</a> for the fourth quarter. </p> <p>Rival carmakers gained in response, with Volkswagen and BMW rising more than 2 per cent in Europe.</p> <p>Investors were starting the year with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58a0dbf0-aaf3-4ec0-8e56-5d47f9a1b42b\">several risks</a> bubbling in the background, said Karl Steiner, a strategist at Swedish bank SEB. Evergrande's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc49ae99-9fe5-494e-a2ae-a05be25eb309\">notice on Monday </a>that it would again suspend its shares in Hong Kong injected “a bit of uncertainty”, Steiner added. </p> <p>The property developer has been at the centre of a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21acda99-ee35-4f6d-8cfa-017d55e1bb10\">sector-wide crisis</a>&#xa0;in the world's biggest emerging markets for months. Hong Kong's Hang Seng share index fell 0.5 per cent on Monday, with the property development sector off 1.1 per cent. </p> <p>Mounting tensions between western countries and Russia have also caught investors' attention, with Joe Biden, US president, warning that Washington would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3142343-9c76-42c8-a949-634f662fddfb\">act “decisively”</a> should Russia invade Ukraine. </p> <p>Oil prices edged higher on both sides of the Atlantic ahead of an Opec meeting on Tuesday to discuss boosting output. Brent crude, the international benchmark, ticked up 1.5 per cent to $78.98 a barrel following reports that Libya's production had been choked off due to a damaged pipeline. </p> <p><strong>​Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/224f71e1-69aa-43ca-887c-5e6fd1625615\"><em>Why are US Treasuries still so popular in the UK?</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/224f71e1-69aa-43ca-887c-5e6fd1625615\"><em>From Jonathan Haslam, Professor Emeritus in the History of International Relations, University of Cambridge, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Bryce Elder and Adam Samson in London and Joe Rennison in New York 2022 'US government bonds knocked in 2022 debut' FT.com 3 January.
