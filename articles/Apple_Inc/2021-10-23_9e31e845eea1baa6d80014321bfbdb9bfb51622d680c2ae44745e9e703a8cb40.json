  "text": "<p>Tonight will unfold on a beach on the Coromandel Peninsula in New&#xa0;Zealand, surrounded by sky and sea, green valleys, misty rainforests and pristine golden&#xa0;sand. Tailoring the perfect guest list is a delicate art. Mine is a blend of humour, knowledge, fun and royalty.</p> <p>Having grown up in New Zealand, it&#xa0;would be remiss of me not to invite at least one Kiwi. I have asked the actor and film-maker <strong>Taika Waititi</strong>, who will supply the jokes. For knowledge, we have <strong>Anthony Bourdain</strong>, the great chef, who will share all his wisdom and experiences. <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> will bring kindness, intelligence and fun to the table, and I presume she'll get on extremely well with <strong>Nigella Lawson</strong>, the queen of cookery and my final guest. Later on, I expect Michelle and her majesty to hit the dance floor&#xa0;together.</p> <p>Bread, butter, crisps and martinis are non-negotiable. They won't exactly go with the main course, but it's my fantasy so we'll play by my rules. We&#xa0;start with bread from Lyle's restaurant in east London, Bungay butter and Tyrrells salt and vinegar crisps, accompanied by a dry Sipsmith martini with a twist. Next, asparagus with brown butter and poached egg — three of my favourite&#xa0;things. Well, four, if you add in&#xa0;a buttery Grgich Hills Chardonnay&#xa0;2005.</p> <p>Chef Wichet Khongphoon is the life and soul of every party and a friend of mine, so I need him in the kitchen. His King's Cross restaurant, <a href=\"https://supawan.co.uk/\">Supawan</a>, is a small, understated spot on the Caledonian Road that knocks out insanely delicious Thai food. His cooking is balanced and thrilling. It awakens the senses, which is precisely what I want&#xa0;here.</p> <p>We'll feast on <em>pla tod naam pla</em>: crispy&#xa0;sea bass fillet laced with fish sauce&#xa0;and palm sugar, with a green apple salad. <em>Yum kamin khao</em>, a white turmeric salad with salted prawns, lime and fish sauce. And <em>Yum koah tod</em>, a salad of crispy, crushed rice balls with peanuts, ginger, coriander, Kaffir lime and chillies, hot and sharp. These are life-giving flavours. And since Wichet also owns the florist next door, perhaps he can do the flowers as well.</p> <p>If my guests are desperate for something sweet, we can have an apple tarte tatin with freshly churned vanilla ice cream. But I would prefer a cheese course because cheese is another one of my favourite things. On&#xa0;the warm Coromandel Peninsula, we'll have Vacherin with sourdough crisps made from leftover bread (making them&#xa0;zero‑waste), paired with a bottle&#xa0;of&#xa0;Vern&#xa0;from Renegade Urban Winery, which is just a juicy bottle of&#xa0;goodness.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Chantelle Nicholson 2021 'Chantelle Nicholson's fantasy dinner party — a Thai feast on the New Zealand coast' FT.com 23 October.
