  "text": "<p>   When Lamia Funti was looking to add a signature cocktail to her Lamia's Fish Market restaurant in Manhattan's East Village, she wanted something tasty, boozy and just a little trashy to keep things on a lighter note. And she quickly remembered a drink from the past: the Long Island Iced Tea. </p><p>   \"There's nothing trashier,\" she said of the cocktail, which mimics the taste of ice tea through the potent combination of several spirits, plus mixers. </p><p>   Ms. Funti also wanted to give the drink a fresher, classier take, so she updated the recipe with such ingredients as sherry and sake. The result is a craft-minded version of the old-school sip that she calls a Manhattan Iced Tea. She serves it with a mini bottle of Champagne to make for a fancier affair. </p><p>   So it similarly goes at other bars and restaurants throughout the city. The newest thing in cocktails is turning out to be something old, as in retro drinks with a guilty-pleasure -- or, yes, even trashy -- quality. But the cocktails are being rethought for an era in which mixologists are constantly looking to outdo each other with their complex creations. </p><p>   At the Dead Rabbit, the lower Manhattan craft-cocktail bar, one of the stars is an Appletini, or apple martini, a drink that dates back at least a couple of decades. The Dead Rabbit version makes use of fresh ingredients and gets a boost of flavor from celery bitters. </p><p>   \"We take forgotten cocktails and make them more palatable,\" said Jillian Vose, beverage director. </p><p>    Dante, another renowned craft bar, with two locations in Manhattan, also is taking a trip back in time this summer with a menu of drinks inspired by the Cosmopolitan, the cocktail that combines vodka, cranberry juice and triple sec, and is forever associated with the television show \"Sex and the City.\" The Cosmo Collection, as it is called, is being offered at Dante's West Village establishment and features such versions as the Barbados Cosmo, with passion-fruit liqueur, and the Coco Cosmo, with coconut liqueur. </p><p>   \"It's a love letter to the Cosmo,\" said Dante beverage director Chris Moore. </p><p>   Bar-industry professionals say that nostalgia is clearly the most significant driver of this retro trend, which is focused largely on drinks popularized between the '70s and the early 2000s that often were sweet and easy to drink, and delivered an alcoholic punch. </p><p>   At the same time, older bargoers' tastes have matured, industry professionals say, which means they might be seeking drinks with a little more complexity. </p><p>   There is a risk that comes with reinventing cocktails, warns Art Sutley, a hospitality-industry consultant. As creative as establishments might want to get, they must stay true to the original flavor profile for the fans who came of age with the drink. </p><p>   \"If you take them too far from what the cocktail means to them, I think you've done a disservice,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
