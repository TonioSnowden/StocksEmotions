  "text": "<p>    Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company is looking into digital currencies and that cryptocurrency is part of his personal portfolio. </p><p>   Though what Apple's cryptocurrency-related projects might look like remains unclear, potential endeavors into digital currencies wouldn't involve investing Apple's sizable cash balance into them, Mr. Cook said. \"I don't think people buy an Apple stock to get exposure to crypto,\" Mr. Cook said in a prerecorded interview for the New York Times DealBook Online Summit Tuesday. </p><p>   Cryptocurrency is already part of Mr. Cook's personal investments, he said in response to a question asking whether he owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum. Mr. Cook said he has been interested in digital currencies \"for a while\" and doing research on them. </p><p>   \"I think it's reasonable to own it as a part of a diversified portfolio, and I'm not giving anybody investment advice,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Cook said the company has no immediate plans to accept cryptocurrency on Apple Pay or as a means of tender for its products. \"But there are other things that we are definitely looking at,\" he said, without specifying more. </p><p>   On nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, Mr. Cook said he views them as interesting, though it will take a while for them to gain mainstream use. NFTs are bitcoin-like tokens, with a twist: Only one at a time is created and they aren't interchangeable, as currency tokens are. The NFT is connected to a digital work of art or other real-world item and sold as a unique digital property. </p><p>   Other companies and executives have ventured into the realm of crypto. Tesla Inc. disclosed a $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin in February and soon after began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for its vehicles. The company quickly reversed course, however, suspending that initiative in May as Elon Musk expressed worry about the source of the electricity being used to power bitcoin mining. Mr. Musk, the electric-vehicle company's chief executive, in July said that he and his rocket company, SpaceX, hold bitcoin. </p><p>   Part of bitcoin's appeal for some holders is that it isn't circulated or controlled by a government or nation. Unlike opening up a bank account to store dollars, euros or yen, starting a bitcoin account doesn't require providing identifying information. Bitcoin is effectively anonymous, and law enforcement can't freeze a bitcoin account as they could a bank account. </p><p>    PayPal Holdings Inc. finance chief John Rainey earlier this year said the digital-payments company was looking to expand its lucrative business of enabling customers to pay merchants with crypto assets, though it didn't yet plan to invest in them. </p><p>   Payments company Square Inc., which is headed by bitcoin advocate Jack Dorsey, in October 2020 said it acquired about $50 million worth of bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Mr. Dorsey is also CEO of Twitter Inc. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. acquired $100 million of bitcoin for its general investment account, the company said in December 2020. </p><p></p>",
