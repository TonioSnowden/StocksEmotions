  "title": "Warner Music CEO Steve Cooper to Step Down Next Year; In email to employees, executive says he told the board to start searching for successor",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Cooper, 75 years old, said he has instructed the board to begin the search for his successor, and that he and the board expect the transition to take place by the end of 2023, according to the email viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>His successor likely will face pressure to revive a stock price that is lower than when the company went public in June 2020 and navigate a shifting music business amid broader concerns of an economic downturn.</p><p>Any successor will also need to win the approval of billionaire Len Blavatnik, whose Access Industries Inc. controls Warner Music. Mr. Cooper said the company would look internally and externally for his successor. Warner Music's CEO of recorded music, Max Lousada, is perceived as the most likely internal candidate, according to people at the company and in the industry.</p><p>Mr. Cooper's decade-plus tenure atop Warner is a somewhat unlikely success story. As a finance-focused outsider to the music industry, his appointment in 2011 as the record business was shrinking was met with skepticism.</p><p>A University of Pennsylvania Wharton School graduate, Mr. Cooper arrived at Warner Music as a seasoned business leader with stints including CEO at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., Hawaiian Telcom and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts; CEO and restructuring chief of Enron Corp.; and executive chairman of Blue Bird Corp. and Collins &amp; Aikman Corp.â€”and essentially no experience in music.</p><p>But as streaming on services such as Spotify and Apple Music became the primary way consumers listened to music, Warner Music under Mr. Cooper's watch earned the reputation of an early adopter of new technologies amid digital disruption. In 2016, Warner Music was the first major label to report streaming as its largest source of recorded music revenue.</p><p>Warner Music owns labels including Atlantic, Elektra and its flagship Warner Records, as well as Warner Chappell Music, the third-largest music publisher. During Mr. Cooper's reign, the company has broken superstar acts including Ed Sheeran, Lizzo and Dua Lipa, and expanded deals with artists Coldplay, Prince and Madonna. It also has acquired the catalogs of David Guetta and David Bowie.</p><p>Warner Music's global recorded-music market share has increased by nearly 11% during Mr. Cooper's tenure, to 16.7% in 2021, according to industry tracker Music &amp; Copyright. The company's revenue rose nearly 19% in its most recent fiscal year, its best showing this century, to $5.3 billion.</p><p>\"I'm now six decades into my career, and of everything I've done, this is the job I've enjoyed the most,\" Mr. Cooper wrote in the email, adding that he is proud to say he is the longest-running CEO in Warner Music's history.</p><p>He said the company is positioned for continued growth and innovation.</p><p>\"We're just at the beginning of a new golden age of music,\" he wrote.</p><p>Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com</p><p>Warner Music CEO Steve Cooper to Step Down Next Year</p>",
