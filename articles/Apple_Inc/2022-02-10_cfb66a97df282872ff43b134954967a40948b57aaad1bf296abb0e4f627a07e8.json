  "title": "'The Sky Is Everywhere' Review: Vividly Capturing Love and Loss; A high-school student struggles with the death of her older sister in Josephine Decker's screen version of Jandy Nelson's young-adult novel",
  "text": "<p>And daring. In a time of focus-grouped screenplays and coolly calculated productions, here's an independent film that risks all to portray joy, grief and assorted bewilderments in between. (It's playing in theaters and streaming on Apple TV+.)</p><p>The story is set in the present, but the setting bespeaks eternal hippiedom—a northern California of rampant ferns, towering redwoods and time-warpy eccentrics who include Lennie's grandmother, Gram, and grandfather, Big; they're played, respectively, by Cherry Jones and Jason Segel. Lennie's sister died of the same heart arrythmia that killed their mother, and there's no sign of her father. She turns mainly to her best friend, Sarah (Ji-young Yoo), for advice on getting through a depression so deep that she can no longer coax a note from her clarinet, even though Lennie is, by all accounts, a gifted musician. (The work of a singularly gifted musician, Caroline Shaw, dominates the adventurous soundtrack.)</p><p>Lennie's depression isn't permanent. She grows enchanted by that trumpeter, Joe Fontaine (an intense Jacques Colimon). Joe actually spends more time on the guitar, which Mr. Colimon plays impressively. He uses it to seduce Lennie in a scene that plays second fiddle only to a longer one in which Bach bonds their souls—the selection that does it is \"Air on the G String.\" The scene is full of feeling, as befits one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written. It is also hilariously and intentionally over the top, what with vines intertwining and flowers bursting into bloom, another instance of the filmmaker's heedlessness in the service of young passion. (In a film made mostly by women, the cinematographer was Ava Berkofsky.)</p><p>Ms. Decker has been there before. Her 2018 feature, \"Madeline's Madeline,\" was all aswirl in extravagant images, the tale of a talented, troubled teenager caught between her wildly neurotic mother and an emotionally predatory woman who leads an improv group. Lennie finds herself caught between Joe and another attractive guy, Toby (Pico Alexander), who shares her grief because he was her sister's boyfriend. At the same time grief and joy share their place in Lennie's life with selfishness, literary gloom—she's obsessed by \"Wuthering Heights\"—and lacerating guilt. \"The Sky Is Everywhere\" covers a lot of ground, and it isn't all strewn with blossoms.</p><p>'The Sky Is Everywhere' Review: Vividly Capturing Love and Loss</p>",
