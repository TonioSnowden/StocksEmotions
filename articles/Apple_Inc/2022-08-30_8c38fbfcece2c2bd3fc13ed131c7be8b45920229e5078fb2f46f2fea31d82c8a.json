  "title": "More young, middle-class Americans flock to dollar stores, seeking a refuge from inflation; Dollar stores and analysts say middle-income consumers are now experiencing similar pain to lower-income households",
  "text": "<p>Most of this new influx of customers are making $50,000 to $75,000 a year, and some make up to $100,000 a year, he told investors. The core Dollar General customer typically has an annual household income of $40,000, Vasos said last year.</p><p>Similarly, Mike Wytinski, president and CEO of Dollar Tree DLTR, told investors last week that new customers were coming into both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar over the last year, and the majority belonged to households making $80,000 a year or higher.</p><p>One somewhat kooky example: Consumers are buying more powder detergent instead of the liquid varieties, and often skipping on fabric softener, Wytinski said, as prices for those products rise. Powder detergents are usually cheaper and more potent than liquid ones, theoretically making each load of laundry cheaper.</p><p>Last week, Dollar General reported robust second-quarter sales and profit, and predicted a positive full-year outlook, while its smaller rival Dollar Tree reported lower second-quarter revenue than analysts expected and lowered full-year earnings guidance.</p><p>(Dollar Tree was not available for comment. A representative for Dollar General referred MarketWatch to the remarks by its CEO during the earnings call. )</p><p>Middle-income customers feel the pinch</p><p>Still, both Dollar General and Dollar Tree said Americans are looking for bargains. Inflation has soared over the past year, hitting 8.5% on the year in July. Although the recent dips in energy prices have given consumers some relief, grocery prices continued to grow by 13.1% in July compared to last year.</p><p>But middle-income consumers — \"they're the ones who really pulled back the most in August,\" said Scott Brave, the lead consumer spending economist at Morning Consult, a global market-research firm.</p><p>Inflation leads to people having to make hard decisions for their family, Brave said. \"We saw that right away with the lower earners. We're now seeing it with the middle learners, and we'll see how far that goes up the income ladder.\"</p><p>Middle-income or middle-class households are a varied bunch: They cover an annual income of $52,000 to $156,000 in 2020, according to this definition in a recent Pew Research Center report. The range is approximately two-thirds to twice the national median income.</p><p>That may explain why sales for higher priced electronics, like Apple's AAPL iPhone, have continued to rise, despite inflationary pressures. Apple topped expectations with its June-quarter iPhone sales, reporting $40.67 billion in revenue, versus $39.57 billion a year prior.</p><p>Still, household budgets are stretched. Credit-card balances nationally increased by $46 billion in the second quarter of 2022, up 13% on the same period a year ago, marking the biggest increase in more than 20 years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p><p>Overall, Americans are cutting back on their discretionary spending, including on clothing and electronic devices, according to a recent report by Morning Consult's economic analyst Kayla Bruun and her colleague Scott Brave.</p><p>Lower-income consumers are struggling too</p><p>Lower-income consumers still felt the pinch of inflation the most, with some saying they were eating less meat and more beans. More than 20 million U.S. homes were 30 to 90 days in arrears on paying their utility bills, many of who were lower income consumers.</p><p>Around a third of consumers earning less than $50,000 a year were living paycheck to paycheck with difficulties paying their bills in June, compared to 17% of consumers earning between $50,000 and $100,000, according to this recent survey.</p><p>Like many of those lower-income families, middle-income earners — those who earn $50,000 to $100,000 a year — purchased the cheaper version of some products and skipped buying others entirely, Brave told MarketWatch.</p><p>Traditionally lower-income consumers were more sensitive to price changes, and prioritize essentials due to pressure on their finances, Bruun said. \"They have to buy groceries, they have to buy gas,\" she said, adding, \"They don't have a lot of choices.\"</p><p>And yet from May to late June, middle-income consumers with a yearly income of $40,000 to $80,000 overtook low-income shoppers as the group most affected by rising grocery prices, according to data company Numerator's price index.</p><p>Also read:</p><p>It's not just inflation. People aren't visiting clothing stores like they used to because they're sick of loungewear.</p><p>'It's the first step to eviction.' Why 20 million U.S. homes are struggling to pay their utility bills.</p><p>Online prices are finally declining after 2 years of increases — but only for these select items</p><p>More young, middle-class Americans flock to dollar stores, seeking a refuge from inflation</p>",
