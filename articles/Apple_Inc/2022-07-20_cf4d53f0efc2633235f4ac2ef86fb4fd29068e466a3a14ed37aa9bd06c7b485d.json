  "title": "U.S. News:  Antitrust Bill's Backers Push for Vote  ---  Lawmakers release  documents that they  say make the case  for tougher regulation  ----  By Ryan Tracy",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Facing a potential stalemate, lawmakers backing an antitrust bill targeting big tech companies ramped up their push for a vote Tuesday by releasing new internal tech company documents that they say show anti-competitive behavior. </p><p>   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) and Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.), the chairman of that panel's antitrust subcommittee, called for a vote on legislation that would make it illegal for the largest tech platforms to favor their own products and services over those of competitors. </p><p>   The lawmakers released documents gathered in an investigation that concluded in 2020 of Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc., which they said support allegations that the companies have leveraged their popular platforms to unfairly boost proprietary side businesses. </p><p>   Tech companies oppose the legislation, saying it would unnecessarily raise the costs of operating platforms that are popular because they benefit consumers and small businesses. </p><p>   The bill banning self-preferencing has been approved by the House committee and its Senate counterpart, with support from many Democrats and a small group of Republicans. But it hasn't received a vote on the floor of either chamber. Another bill under consideration would target Apple and Google's smartphone app stores. </p><p>   Supporters' lobbying of late has targeted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). The Democratic leader hasn't publicly committed to holding a vote, though the legislation's primary Senate backer, Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), has said Mr. Schumer promised he would call one. </p><p>   \"I'm working with Sen. Klobuchar,\" Mr. Schumer told reporters Tuesday. \"I support these bills. I want to bring them to the floor. We have to see that we have 60 votes.\" </p><p>   The documents released Tuesday were first cited in a House report published in 2020 but hadn't been previously released in full. </p><p>   Several documents show Google executives discussing how to boost Google Search and other products via the Google-owned Android mobile operating system. </p><p>   In one 2013 email chain discussing requirements Google would impose on equipment manufacturers using Android, a Google executive described a directive from Sundar Pichai, who was then overseeing products and is now the company's chief executive, about requirements for the placement of Google products: \"We should be more prescriptive.\" </p><p>   The House committee cited that document as evidence of anticompetitive self-preferencing by Google. </p><p>   \"Dominant platforms abuse their monopoly power to destroy competition, exploit other businesses, harm consumers and impede disruptive innovation,\" said Mr. Cicilline. </p><p>   In response, a Google spokesman said, \"the Committee's cherry-picked documents show consistent competition and a focus on delivering high-quality services to Android users.\" </p><p>   \"Free services like Google Search, Maps and Gmail help people every day, and Android has created more choices at lower costs,\" he said. </p><p>   A 2010 internal Amazon email shows the results of an internal case study in which an Amazon marketplace seller who uses the company's \"fulfillment by Amazon\" service would be more likely to win top placement on a product page than a seller who didn't. </p><p>   The House committee said this shows Amazon favoring sellers who pay for its add-on delivery and storage service. </p><p>   An Amazon representative didn't respond to a request tor comment. </p><p>   Groups bankrolled by tech giants have spent more than $36 million on TV and internet ads making their case that the legislation could make it harder to offer popular services. </p><p>   Both supporters and opponents of the legislation insist that if a vote is held, their side will prevail. Ms. Klobuchar has privately said there are more than 60 votes in favor of the bill in the Senate, said one person who met with her in recent weeks. Tech company representatives question that assertion, pointing to evidence that some senators' support is wavering. </p><p></p>",
