  "text": "<p>Members of a US Senate committee have voted to advance a bill that would reshape the technology industry, bringing one of the greatest regulatory threats to large Silicon Valley companies a step closer to becoming law.</p> <p>By a vote of 16-6 on Thursday, senators on the judiciary committee approved the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which is designed to stop companies giving preferential treatment to their own products and services. </p> <p>The bill, which is one of a range of measures designed to update US competition policy for the technology age, will now be eligible for a vote by the full Senate, although it is unclear when that will happen. </p> <p>If it passes both houses of Congress, the bill will have major implications for companies such as Alphabet and Amazon. Both of those companies warned publicly about its consequences in the run-up to Thursday's vote as part of a major lobbying operation by some of America's most influential business groups.</p> <p>That lobbying operation — including a 40-minute call from Apple's chief executive Tim Cook to Ted Cruz, according to the Republican senator — largely failed to sway the committee, however, where the bill received bipartisan support. And in a sign of how the argument over Big Tech has scrambled regular partisan loyalties, many of its biggest champions were Republicans and some of its most vociferous critics were Democrats.</p> <p>Amy Klobuchar, the Democratic senator from Minnesota who has led the bill, said: “January 1 1983 is considered the official birthday of the internet. Now nearly 40 years later, we are still here without a single piece of meaningful competition legislation addressing the massive economy that it has created. </p> <p>“If the tech companies and their armies of lobbyists — 2,500 at the last count — are hoping that they can stop us from getting a vote, bring it on. This is our moment.”</p> <p>Klobuchar's bill is one of several in front of Congress aimed at tackling the market power of the world's largest technology companies. A version of it has passed through the House of Representatives judiciary committee, though Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, has still not scheduled it for a vote by the whole chamber.<br><br>The bill's main provisions include banning the misuse of data to gain a competitive advantage, biasing search results to favour a search engine's own products, and any requirements for third-party merchants to pay for a platform's services in return for more prominent placement. Violations of the law would be punishable with penalties of up to 15 per cent of a company's US revenue.</p> <p>Senators amended the bill during the committee debate, including by specifying that it should also cover the Chinese technology companies Tencent and TikTok, and clarifying that groups should not be forced to hand over data to any other technology company that has been sanctioned by the US government. </p> <p>Klobuchar added that she would continue to discuss further amendments with colleagues on the committee, several of whom expressed reservations with the bill and the speed with which it was debated.</p> <p>Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California, where many big technology companies are based, said during the hearing: “It's difficult to see the justification for a bill that regulates the behaviour of only a handful of companies while allowing everyone else to continue engaging in that exact same behaviour.”</p> <p>Nor were the bill's corporate critics placated by the amendments to the bill circulated in advance of the vote. Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, said in a blog post: “These changes concede every concern that has been raised about the bill — and solve none of them.”</p> <p>He added: “We believe that updating technology regulations in areas like privacy, AI, and protections for kids and families could provide real benefits. But breaking our products wouldn't address any of these issues.” </p> <p>Brian Huseman, Amazon's public policy head, <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-statement-on-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act\">claimed</a> the bill singled out the online retailer while “giving preferential treatment to other large retailers that engage in the same practices”.</p> <p>In a letter obtained by the Financial Times, Apple told the committee the bill “will reward those who have been irresponsible with users' data and empower bad actors who would target consumers with malware, ransomware, and scams”.</p> <p>Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday said the legislation “ultimately will lead us down a pretty dangerous path”.</p> <p>The Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a think-tank backed by Big Tech, released results of research on what it described as the “irreparable harm” that could be inflicted on the US technology industry by AICOA.</p> <p>The PPI claimed popular products and services would become a shadow of their former selves, “severely” hampering more modern features of Google's search engine, such as additional functionality when researching flights or finding a restaurant.</p> <p>“It might look something like search engines from the mid-1990s,” the report said, alongside a screenshot of the Yahoo website in 1994.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Patrick McGee in San Francisco</em></p><p>Source: Dave Lee in San Francisco and Kiran Stacey in Washington 2022 'US Senate committee advances bill to tame Big Tech's power ' FT.com 20 January.
