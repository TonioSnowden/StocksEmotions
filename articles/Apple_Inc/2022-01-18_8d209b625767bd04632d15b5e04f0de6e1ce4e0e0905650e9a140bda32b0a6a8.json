  "text": "<p>Activision chief Bobby Kotick is the best-paid CEO in the games industry for good reason.</p> <p>Time and again, he has shown himself to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daba471a-83b2-11e5-8e80-1574112844fd\">the shrewdest of operators</a> — spotting the latest trends, making the smartest acquisitions, providing the greatest returns for shareholders, and overtaking Electronic Arts as the leading video game publisher.</p> <p>Allowing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3726a3a-c4a0-4761-a82c-cda98abc3cb7\">Microsoft to take over</a> the publisher of <em>Call of Duty</em> for a whopping $68.7bn is his biggest deal yet (as well as Microsoft's largest acquisition), and perhaps his cleverest.</p> <p>Look back to 2007, when he practised a similar chess move with France's Vivendi media group. He gave away 52 per cent of the company to Vivendi to propel Activision into subscription online role-playing games, through the <a href=\"https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vivendi-and-activision-create-activision-blizzard-worlds-largest\">merger with <em>World of Warcraft</em> maker Blizzard,</a> then part of Vivendi's interactive entertainment business. Games became non-core to Vivendi and Kotick waited patiently until he was able <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23640708-f59e-11e2-94e9-00144feabdc0\">to buy out</a> the French company in 2013 for $8.2bn, taking back control of an independent company once again.</p> <p>This time around, Kotick has realised that he needs Microsoft to leverage Activision into cloud gaming and the metaverse — new areas where such support could give the company the resources and first-mover advantage to win leadership. The price tag is much higher and Kotick is surrendering the whole company in this all-cash offer.</p> <p>It will still have a degree of independence: Kotick will continue to lead it and <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/satya-nadella-email-to-employees-bringing-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone/\">report to Phil Spencer</a>, the new chief executive of Microsoft Gaming. The transaction could take over a year to complete, with regulatory approvals needed for a deal that would make Microsoft the world's third-largest gaming company by revenues, behind Tencent and Sony. </p> <p>Perhaps we are entering a new era, where a handful of major companies with huge market capitalisations are able to dominate gaming and offer the full stack of hardware, network resources and content — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft all have the wherewithal. <a href=\"https://activisionblizzard.com/newsroom/2022/01/defining-the-future\">Kotick says </a>that Disney, NetEase, Sony and Tencent can be added to the list.</p> <p>He could<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KYWeise/status/1483468917494333442\"> leave on completion</a> of this deal. But do not rule out gaming becoming non-core to Microsoft or regulators intervening in a way that allows Kotick to respawn Activision as an independent entity again. Blockbuster sequels are his speciality.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Facebook patents reveal metaverse plans</strong><br>Pupil movements, body poses and nose scrunching are among the flickers of human expression that Meta wants to harvest in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d40aac-034e-4e0b-95eb-c5d34146f647\">building its metaverse, </a>according to an analysis of dozens of patents recently granted to Facebook's parent company. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive, has pledged to spend $10bn a year over the next decade on the nebulous and much-hyped concept denoting an immersive virtual world filled with avatars.</p> <p><strong>2. Gamer backlash against NFTs</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0defed4-60d8-4221-8abc-4e70245c1726\">Tom Faber can explain</a> why gamers are angry over publishers beginning to offer sole ownership of unique items through non-fungible tokens for their titles, despite players being accustomed to buying in-game virtual currencies and possessions. One reason is the environmental cost of using blockchains. Gamers have pointed out the irony in the case of Square Enix, whose biggest game, <em>Final Fantasy VII,</em> is an eco-fable about a nefarious corporation profiting from environmental destruction.</p> <p><strong>3. UK tightens crypto advertising rules</strong><br>After <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0dd946a-2d59-4f9f-8070-f71d9b226a09\">Spain on Monday</a>, the UK on Tuesday said that crypto companies would face <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d58c5181-aabc-47e5-bac1-8f68dc43928d\">stricter advertising rules</a>, with the Financial Conduct Authority given oversight of most cryptocurrency promotions. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, said it was important that consumers were not being sold products with misleading claims.</p> <p><strong>4. US airlines warn of ‘chaos' over 5G rollout</strong><br>The imminent rollout of high-speed 5G telecoms services <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c46dfe9-7d4e-42a2-95fe-582b29867b4e\">threatens to ground flights</a> across the US, America's largest airlines have warned. “The harm that will result from deployment on January 19 is substantially worse than we originally anticipated,” they said, pointing to the potential for 5G services to interfere with the sensitive equipment that aircraft use to take off and land. </p> <p><strong>5. Factory of the future</strong><br>Our latest Special Report on the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cc51613-4b6c-4627-af19-068e16bc1ec0\"> Future of Industry</a> looks at the factory of the future, gigafactory battery projects and the impact of 3D printing.</p> <h2>Tech tools — ‘The Matrix Awakens'</h2> <p>Continuing the gaming and metaverse theme, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8041385-7453-415a-81a4-0a4594718c53\">Tom Faber has been looking at </a>the new film and game released last month based on <em>The Matrix,</em> which is once more pushing ideas of what games and cinema might offer as the boundaries between the two blur. He says: “<em>The Matrix Awakens</em> is not a full game but rather a tech demo intended to show off Unreal Engine 5, the latest iteration of Epic's software engine which powers many contemporary games. It features [Keanu] Reeves reprising his role in scenes written by Lana Wachowski, including action and narrative sequences, before players are let loose in a stunningly realistic open world. While you can do little more than play the tourist in this space, it's a remarkable demonstration of the game worlds we can expect as developers get to grips with the new generation of consoles.”</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2022 'Activision leverages itself into metaverse' FT.com 18 January.
