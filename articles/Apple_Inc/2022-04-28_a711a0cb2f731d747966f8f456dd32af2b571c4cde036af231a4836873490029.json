  "text": "<p>   SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. reported record quarterly revenue and saw net profit jump by 59% in the first three months of the year, aided by resilient memory- chip demand and a hotter sales start for its latest flagship smartphone. </p><p>   The South Korean company reported a first-quarter net profit of 11.3 trillion won, or the equivalent of $8.9 billion. That compares with 7.14 trillion won a year earlier. </p><p>   Samsung, the world's biggest maker of chips, smartphones and televisions, posted revenue of 77.8 trillion won for the quarter ended March 31, a 19% rise from a year earlier. </p><p>   The company is considered an industry bellwether as it is a major electronics maker as well as a component supplier for major tech companies such as Apple Inc. Samsung's first-quarter results topped analyst expectations. The prior quarterly revenue record, of 76.6 trillion won, had been set in the October-December period of last year. </p><p>   The performance reflects how semiconductor demand and prices generally have remained strong amid continued shortages in the opening months of 2022. </p><p>   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker, this month reported a 45% jump in net profit for the first quarter. On Wednesday, Qualcomm Inc., best-known for its smartphone chips, reported record quarterly revenue despite a drop in global handset shipments. </p><p>   In the first quarter, Samsung's profit was boosted by strong sales of memory chips, its main business. Prices have stopped rising, a sign that supply is catching up, though remain higher than what they were a year ago. The company's semiconductor operating profit in the first three months of the year rose 152% from the prior year to 8.45 trillion won, while revenue rose 39% to 26.9 trillion won. </p><p>   Samsung's first-quarter earnings were also helped by higher initial demand for its latest Galaxy S22 flagship smartphones, which hit shelves in February. The premium devices bring in the highest margins and are the core drivers of the company's smartphone profit. </p><p>   Global demand is 20% higher for the Galaxy S22 than its predecessor, based on the first six weeks of sales, Samsung recently said. </p><p></p>",
