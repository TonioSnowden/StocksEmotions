  "text": "<p>Mayorkas to Resign</p><p>House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to resign over his handling of the southern border or else face a possible impeachment inquiry.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy, the California congressman who is the presumptive next speaker of the House once Republicans take control of the chamber in January, made the remarks Tuesday alongside several other GOP lawmakers at a press conference in El Paso, Texas. \"House Republicans will investigate every order, every action and every failure, to determine whether we can begin an impeachment inquiry,\" he said.</p><p>In the 2022 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the border saw a record 2.2 million illegal crossings, a number driven by a rise in repeat crossers and a new wave of migration from South America and the Caribbean.</p><p>A DHS spokeswoman said Tuesday that Mr. Mayorkas had no plans to step down.</p><p>Earlier in the day, responding to Mr. McCarthy's trip to the border, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Republicans didn't have a plan to improve the situation.</p><p>\"What is he doing to help? she said.</p><p>Republicans will have a slim House majority: The GOP is projected to have 220 seats and Democrats 212, with three races uncalled by the Associated Press.</p><p>The margin could make it difficult for the GOP to get 218 votes to impeach Mr. Mayorkas or any other administration official, given that some newly elected Republicans are moderates from blue-leaning districts.</p><p>-- Michelle Hackman</p><p>---</p><p>MASSACHUSETTS</p><p>Driver Is Charged</p><p>In Apple Store Crash</p><p>The man who allegedly drove a vehicle into an Apple store Monday, killing one person and injuring at least 18 others, has been charged with reckless homicide by motor vehicle.</p><p>Bradley Rein, 53, was arrested Monday night, said Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz. An attorney for Mr. Rein couldn't be identified.</p><p>The Plymouth County District Attorney's office previously said a man drove a 2019 Toyota 4Runner through the glass facade of an Apple store in Hingham, Mass., in the greater Boston area.</p><p>First responders found injured people in front of the Apple store and inside, officials said. Some people inside the shop were pinned against a wall by the vehicle, officials said.</p><p>Doctors at South Shore Hospital said Monday multiple victims have life-threatening and limb-threatening injuries. South Shore Hospital officials said Tuesday the hospital has treated 18 people who were injured in the crash. Two individuals remain in critical care as of Tuesday, they said.</p><p>\"Our hearts go out to our team members and customers who were injured and all of those who were affected by this terrible incident,\" an Apple spokesman said.</p><p>-- Joseph De Avila</p><p>---</p><p>COVID-19</p><p>New 6-Week Push</p><p>To Get Vaccinated</p><p>The Biden administration said it would redouble efforts to promote updated Covid-19 shots, adding funding and publicity campaigns to lift lackluster booster rates.</p><p>The six-week campaign leading up to the winter holidays will focus on seniors and communities that were hardest hit by the virus, the White House said Tuesday. Some 11% of the U.S. population over the age of 5 has gotten an updated booster shot, federal data show, including just under 30% of people 65 and older.</p><p>\"The bottom line is we need more Americans vaccinated,\" said the administration's Covid-19 response coordinator, Ashish Jha. \"Each of the last two years, we've seen substantial increases late December into January, and so going out and getting vaccinated right now is a great way to protect yourself if that pattern holds.\"</p><p>The easing of the pandemic, vaccine fatigue, confusing messaging and limited outreach from health officials have likely all contributed to the low booster uptake, public-health experts said.</p><p>Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are largely flat, with some 2,200 deaths reported in the week ended Nov. 16, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>-- Brianna Abbott</p><p>---</p><p>NEW YORK</p><p>Law Places Limits</p><p>On Crypto Mining</p><p>New York has become the first state to restrict cryptocurrency mining after Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday signed a two-year moratorium, calling the move necessary to help protect the environment.</p><p>The new law, which took effect immediately, will prevent the reactivation of fossil-fuel power plants for off-the-grid cryptocurrency mining. Cryptocurrency miners earn digital cash by solving equations with computers that require large amounts of energy. Mining that taps into the electrical grid will still be legal.</p><p>Sustainability groups generally object to cryptocurrency mining because of its environmental impacts. Business groups lobbied Ms. Hochul to veto the bill, claiming it would hurt the industry's growth in the state.</p><p>-- Jimmy Vielkind</p><p>---</p><p>OBITUARY</p><p>Brown, Businessman</p><p>Turned Governor, 88</p><p>John Y. Brown Jr., who became Kentucky's governor after building empires in business and sports, has died. He was 88.</p><p>Mr. Brown had been a leading Democratic fundraiser in the 1970s by the time he made his own run for public office. He served as governor from 1979 to 1983.</p><p>He also acquired an international reputation as a master salesman. Kentucky Fried Chicken was a string of small-town restaurants before Mr. Brown turned it into a global enterprise. He purchased Kentucky Fried Chicken from Harland Sanders for $2 million in 1964.</p><p>He also had owned three professional basketball teams, including the Boston Celtics.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p>",
