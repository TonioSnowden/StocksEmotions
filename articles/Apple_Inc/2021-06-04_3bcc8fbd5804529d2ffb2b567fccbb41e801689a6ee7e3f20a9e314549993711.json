  "text": "<p>The view that \"mental-health or substance-abuse crises\" aren't police issues is misleading, and to suggest that trained nonpolice intervenors answer 911 calls is naive. After that concerned neighbor calls 911 in the middle of the night because of the loud shouting and smashing noises next door, the response needs to be police. Why? Because no one knows what's behind that door. But most times that door doesn't open, and probable cause exists that crimes are being committed or people are in danger and the police must force entry and all too often must deal with a dire and dangerous situation as best they can in a few seconds. The notion that trained social workers and \"de-escalation\" experts, no matter how skilled and well intentioned, will resolve these situations is wrongheaded. If that door opens to reveal a clearly deranged person with, say, a machete or a gun, there will be no time to redo the situation by now summoning the police.</p><p>Mr. McGuire's other thoughts -- better treatment options for the mentally ill and no bail for violent recidivists -- are all great policies.</p><p>Matt Farley</p><p>Delray Beach, Fla.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. McGuire's proposal is to confront New York City's crime wave with specialized policing that can deal with mental-health and substance-abuse crises means that NYPD resources will be allocated to therapists and addiction counselors placed on emergency response teams, and more resources would be invested in schools, community centers, paid internships for all city high-schoolers, de-escalation training for police and violence-prevention programs.</p><p>The cost of Mr. McGuire's anticrime plans will squeeze budgets for policing as traditionally defined and require tax hikes -- prompting even more city taxpayers to relocate to states with lower crime and tax rates. Mr. McGuire and Democrats can run but can't hide from the Black Lives Matter call for defunding the police. If one accepts the BLM narrative but also accepts the reality that most victims of crime are black, a plan to defund the police must be dressed up to sound like help-the-police by repurposing their funds. I'd personally prefer to have a cop with a gun show up if a drug addict is pointing a gun at me, but I don't live in New York City and New Yorkers may prefer help from a mental-health professional instead. Mr. McGuire promises to oblige. No wonder the city never sleeps.</p><p>Rob Williams</p><p>Clearwater, Fla.</p>",
