  "title": "Tech Firm Overseers  Also Invest in Them  ---  Federal Trade Commission officials are  heavy stock traders, including in tech,  Wall Street Journal Investigation shows  ----  By Brody Mullins, Rebecca Ballhaus, Chad Day, John West and Coulter Jones",
  "text": "<p>   The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington's most active Wall Street investors. </p><p>   The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers. </p><p>   At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies from 2016 to 2021. </p><p>   Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC's work. </p><p>   A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public. </p><p>   FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 big companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed. </p><p>   The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. </p><p>   An FTC chairman owned Microsoft, Oracle and AT&amp;T while the agency was conducting sensitive reviews affecting the tech and telecom sectors. </p><p>   The head of the FTC's international division bought and sold Facebook stock through a financial adviser as his office coordinated with overseas officials on an investigation involving Facebook. </p><p>   An FTC consumer-protection official had stock in over 10 companies as the agency scrutinized mergers or acquisitions involving the firms. </p><p>   U.S. law prohibits federal employees from participating in policy matters in which they have a significant financial stake. Additional regulations direct federal employees to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. </p><p>   The Journal obtained and analyzed financial disclosures for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees at 50 agencies who ranked high enough that they were required to file public reports. </p><p>   The stock holdings the Journal identified among FTC officials were legal because the rules contain exemptions that often permit officials to own stocks that overlap with their agencies' work. An investment of $15,000 or less in an individual stock, or of $50,000 or less in an industry-specific mutual fund, isn't deemed a conflict of interest under federal regulations. </p><p>   An FTC spokesman said the officials had followed the law. </p><p>   The spokesman said the agency has a \"robust ethics program\" and follows the ethics rules set by Congress and the Office of Government Ethics. He said its ethics office reviews senior employees' disclosures and counsels them on how to comply with the rules. </p><p>   Before ethics officials will certify compliance, they require filers to confirm they have reviewed guidance on potential conflicts and aren't aware of any actual conflicts. Ethics officials certified that the employees in the Journal's review were in compliance with the law. </p><p>   The spokesman said the ethics office reports any conflicts it identifies to the agency's inspector general. Its inspector general referred four such matters to the Justice Department between 2016 and 2020. Prosecutors declined to investigate any of them. </p><p>   The law doesn't require ethics officials to examine qualitative issues, such as the timing of trades, the number of transactions and how stock prices change over the course of the reporting period. </p><p>   Longtime ethics officials said the investing by FTC employees undermines the agency's mission, even though in legal compliance. It \"hurts the reputation of the agency and the government in general,\" said Kent Cooper, a former government official and expert on ethics issues. \"Are these decisions being made for the benefit of the public or the officials who have a personal benefit in the outcome?\" </p><p>   Ethics lawyers said the investments suggest the FTC might need to adopt tighter rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission imposes additional restrictions, including barring officials from trading companies under SEC investigation regardless of whether they have personal knowledge of the probe. The FTC has no such rules. </p><p>   For years, the FTC has faced bipartisan criticism for not more aggressively enforcing competitive practices in corporate America. Now it is poised to take a far higher profile. President Biden has signaled tougher antitrust scrutiny and appointed as chairwoman a vocal critic of large companies. </p><p>   Randolph Tritell, the recently retired head of the FTC's Office of International Affairs, reported more stock trades than any other FTC official in the period examined. The office coordinates with foreign counterparts to make sure rules, merger conditions and enforcement actions are applied consistently, and coordinates the sharing of evidence and other information on overlapping investigations. </p><p>   Mr. Tritell reported large holdings in tech stocks. He held Apple Inc. stock valued at between $100,001 and $250,000, Amazon shares worth $15,001 to $50,000, and $1,001 to $15,000 of Microsoft stock, according to his most recent disclosure form. Since 2016, he has reported a total of more than three dozen trades in Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle. </p><p>   One of his best-timed stock trades was an 80% gain in Amazon over nine months as the European Commission investigated whether the company violated antitrust rules. </p><p>   Mr. Tritell said he followed the law. Ethics officials certified his disclosures each year as complying with the rules. </p><p>   Mr. Tritell said a financial adviser handles his trading. He said he has the authority to provide some direction to the adviser, but rarely does. He said he had \"no role whatsoever\" in Amazon, Oracle, Apple and Microsoft trades. </p><p>   An exception was Facebook, where Mr. Tritell said he didn't have any role in the trades \"other than for one transaction.\" He declined to provide details. </p><p>   Mr. Tritell disclosed six trades in Facebook amid a high-profile investigation into whether the company had abused consumers' privacy. </p><p>   His office coordinated with U.K. officials on the exchange of evidence and other information on an investigation involving Facebook and U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica. The FTC announced they were examining Facebook's privacy practices in March 2018. </p><p>   Two officials in Mr. Tritell's office took the lead in the talks with U.K. counterparts, and one of his deputies acted as a supervisor, according to former officials. Mr. Tritell had informal conversations with colleagues about the probe but wasn't briefed on the details of conversations with the U.K., said officials. </p><p>   At the end of 2017, Mr. Tritell owned between $15,001 and $50,000 of Facebook shares, according to his financial disclosure. In April 2018, Mr. Tritell reported two purchases of Facebook shares. </p><p>   He bought additional shares in June and December. In all, Mr. Tritell invested a total of just under $11,000 in Facebook that year, according to figures he provided the Journal. </p><p>   Facebook shares rose in early 2019, partly on news a settlement of the probe was near. On April 15, 2019, Mr. Tritell reported selling $5,327 worth of the stock, which was up 35% from the December purchase. He sold the rest of his Facebook shares, $22,886 worth, on June 4, he said. </p><p>   In July 2019, the FTC said it was imposing a $5 billion penalty on Facebook over its practices involving users' data. </p><p>   The same day it announced this, the FTC sued Cambridge Analytica and said it had settled with itd former CEO. In its news release, the agency credited the cooperation with U.K. regulators overseen by Mr. Tritell's office. </p><p>   In an interview, Mr. Tritell said that his deputies largely handled fraud and deception matters such as the Facebook probe, and that for most such cases, \"I was less briefed in detail because I knew they were doing a great job.\" </p><p>   He said he didn't discuss his office's involvement in the case with ethics officials. He said they didn't flag any potential conflicts to him. </p><p>   Mr. Tritell said of the Facebook probe: \"I wasn't personally and substantially involved, so there's no issue.\" The law doesn't consider stock holdings to be a conflict unless officials work \"personally and substantially\" on an issue that can affect their investments. </p><p>   Mr Tritell said he meets with his financial adviser to discuss his portfolio roughly every six months. He said he saw his trades when he reviewed his statements to file monthly transaction reports with the FTC ethics office. </p><p>   Mr. Tritell said he finds stock trading \"horribly tedious\" and \"the last thing I want to spend my time on.\" </p><p>   Among officials with large holdings in companies affected by FTC decisions was James Kohm, associate director of the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection's enforcement division. His job includes making sure companies comply with agreements reached with the agency to settle charges of unfair or deceptive practices. </p><p>   Mr. Kohm disclosed owning between $15,001 and $50,000 in both Comcast Corp. and AT&amp;T shares when the FTC's consumer protection bureau issued orders in March 2019 to several U.S. broadband providers, including those two companies, seeking information about their privacy practices. </p><p>   He also reported owning stock in more than three dozen companies, including more than 10 while they were undergoing FTC merger or acquisition reviews. </p><p>   Mr. Kohm held Allstate Corp. shares worth between $100,001 and $250,000 in 2018 when the FTC cleared an Allstate takeover of a company called InfoArmor Inc. </p><p>   Mr. Kohm held $50,001 to $100,000 in AstraZeneca PLC when the company announced a $39 billion plan to acquire drug firm Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. in late 2020. The FTC cleared the deal the following April. </p><p></p>",
