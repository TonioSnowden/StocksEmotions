  "title": "Trudeau Suddenly Faces a Real Challenge; He thought a new election would yield a majority. Now the Conservatives lead.",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Trudeau seems to have underestimated voter frustration. A Mainstreet Research/Toronto Star poll conducted on Aug. 10-11 found that 65% of Canadians wanted to avoid the ballot boxes. That surely includes many Liberals who believe Ottawa is heading in the right direction and don't want to disrupt the political apple cart.</p><p>Meantime, the new Conservative leader, Erin O'Toole, has turned out to be more formidable than expected. He has followed the playbook of Mr. Trudeau's Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper (for whom I worked) and gone on offense. The Conservatives' strategy has three parts.</p><p>First, they've emphasized the cost of the snap \"pandemic election,\" which Elections Canada estimates at around 610 million Canadian dollars (US$480 million), more than C$107 million above the 2019 tab.</p><p>Second, they've capitalized on Mr. Trudeau's poor leadership. He focused on environmental policies and implemented pet projects like a national carbon tax during the pandemic. He proposed a publicly funded universal child-care program that will cost C$30 billion over five years. Building stronger relations with Indigenous leaders, a government priority for years, has failed. And there are Mr. Trudeau's blackface scandal and public spats with other members of Parliament, mostly women.</p><p>Third, they've made it a referendum on Mr. Trudeau's handling of Covid-19. Canada's vaccine-distribution plan got off to a rocky start. His emergency financial relief measures for individuals and businesses expanded the federal deficit to C$343 billion, an order of magnitude bigger than its pre-Covid size, while the debt will surpass C$1 trillion for the first time. The Conservatives promise their own Covid-19 plan, a balanced budget within 10 years, and tax credits for capital investment, child care and small business.</p><p>Mr. O'Toole's international focus is sharper than Mr. Trudeau's. He immediately declared that a Conservative government \"will not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.\" Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau said Canada would take a \"wait and see\" approach a day before Mr. Trudeau said no to recognition.</p><p>Another positive sign for the Conservatives was a shocking win in Nova Scotia's Aug. 17 provincial election. No pollster had called the election for Premier-designate Tim Houston, who won a majority government. Mr. Trudeau was hoping to win the majority that eluded him in 2019. Canadians will decide on Sept. 20 if he continues to govern at all.</p><p>Mr. Taube, a columnist with Troy Media and Loonie Politics, was a speechwriter for former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.</p><p>Trudeau Suddenly Faces a Real Challenge</p>",
