  "title": "Stocks Start Out Strong but Lose Steam --- Apple leads tech sector lower on report it plans to slow down its hiring",
  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 92.37, or 0.8%, to 11360.05. The technology-heavy index closed lower after rising at least 1% intraday for the 13th time this year, which happened only twice in 2021.</p><p>Financial companies kicked off a bumper week of earnings reports Monday. Goldman Sachs gained $7.39, or 2.5%, to $301.26 after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Synchrony Financial, which reported earnings per share that fell year over year but were better than analysts expected, gained 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $31.48.</p><p>Bank of America finished up 1 cent, or less than 1%, after it said second-quarter profit declined 32%. Charles Schwab, which reported second-quarter profit that rose 42%, lost 94 cents, or 1.5%, to $61.24.</p><p>\"There's been a couple of pleasant surprises in earnings,\" said Faron Daugs, chief executive of Harrison Wallace Financial Group, of the latest earnings reports from financial companies.</p><p>Some traders attributed the afternoon's market drop to a report that Apple plans to slow its hiring next year, news that was earlier reported by Bloomberg News and which weighed on tech shares. The tech company lost $3.10, or 2.1%, to $147.07. The S&amp;P's tech segment shed 1%.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet fell $2.75, or 2.5%, to $109.03. The company's shares split 20-for-1 after Friday's close. Microsoft lost $2.47, or 1%, to $254.25.</p><p>\"That's some heavy weight for the market to bear,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \"These are market leaders. These are also companies that set the high end of the pay scale.\"</p><p>\"We believe growth is performing a floor here, and this would be mostly the technology sector, but even broader than that,\" said Ivana Delevska, founder and chief executive of Spear Invest, a firm focused on industrial technology companies.</p><p>Investors are trying to reconcile a dire economic outlook with earnings forecasts that remain relatively positive. Economic growth is showing signs of slowing while inflation is soaring, last week reaching a four-decade high. Meanwhile, central banks are raising interest rates rapidly, adding another cloud on the economy's horizon. So far, corporate reports have been lackluster.</p><p>\"Either the economic story is wrong or analysts are being too optimistic on earnings, and it feels like the latter,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors.</p><p>Other companies due to report this week include Johnson &amp; Johnson on Tuesday, Tesla on Wednesday and Twitter on Friday.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.959% from 2.929% on Friday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Commodity prices rebounded following a stretch of weakness. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 5.1% to $106.27 a barrel. Copper rose 3.5%, while gold advanced 0.4%.</p><p>Overseas, global markets were higher across the board. In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 finished up 0.9%.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.2% and mainland China's CSI 300 was down 0.8%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.3%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
