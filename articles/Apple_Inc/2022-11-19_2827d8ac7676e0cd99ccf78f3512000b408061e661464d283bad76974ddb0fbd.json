  "text": "<p>   In the summer of 1947, a Danish toy maker named Ole Kirk Kristiansen received as a gift a set of small, colorful plastic blocks from England. The Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks promised \"hundreds of hours of really worth-while play.\" Kristiansen was inspired. A couple years later, he released his Automatic Binding Bricks under his own brand, Lego. </p><p>   Kristiansen never denied imitating Kiddicraft, according to Jens Andersen's history of the company, \"The Lego Story: How a Little Toy Sparked the World's Imagination\" (Mariner, 418 pages, $32.50). And in all fairness, he wasn't copying a tremendous success. The bricks weren't selling well in England, and Kristiansen's facsimiles didn't fare any better in Denmark. So how did Lego break through to become the largest toy manufacturer in the world? The same way Apple achieved industry dominance -- through a combination of fanatical leadership, user-friendly design and astute marketing. </p><p>   In the 1950s, as the living room became the focal point of the home, Lego marketed its bricks as a bonding activity for parents and children. In the '70s, it followed a strategy of market segmentation, with larger blocks, called Duplo, for toddlers, and Minifigures catering toward girls' penchant for role play. When video games threatened the toy industry in the '80s, Lego partnered with the AI pioneer Seymour Papert and the MIT Media Lab to bring the bricks into the computer age. </p><p>   But no marketing tactic would have worked if Lego hadn't first redesigned the brick in 1958. The original Kiddicraft blocks had studded tops but were hollow inside, preventing them from locking in place. Lego addressed the flaw by filling the underside with tubes. The bricks could then stick together and be easily pulled apart and reassembled. (The innovation also helped protect Lego against patent challenges from the likes of Kiddicraft.) </p><p>   That '50s-era brick is the same one found in Lego sets today -- and one of the objects included in \"1000 Design Classics\" (Phaidon, 591 pages, $89.95), a coffee-table tome containing items dating from the 1600s to 2019. One of the hallmarks of a great design is enduring relevance -- its useful beauty evident long after it is first conceived. Some forms are so close to perfection that they remain relatively unaltered for decades. The elegantly modern, pocket-size Moleskine notebook, for example, dates back to around 1850. The snappable waribashi chopsticks in every Japanese takeout order originate in the 1870s. The Melitta cone coffee filter, invented by the German housewife Melitta Bentz, hasn't changed since 1937. Reading the stories behind these humble objects is every bit as enjoyable as revisiting the iconic masterpieces of Alvar Aalto, Ray and Charles Eames and Dieter Rams. </p><p>   Exemplary design also has a history of making mystifying technology easy to use. Yves Behar has built his studio, Fuseproject, on doing just that. In the early aughts, the Swiss-born designer rose to stardom as Silicon Valley's surfboarding wunderkind, designing products for such startups as Jawbone, SodaStream and Tile. In \"Yves Behar Fuseproject: Designing Ideas\" (Thames &amp; Hudson, 419 pages, $85), he gives us, with the help of the journalist Adam Fisher, a peek into his process. \"Design is the practice of putting a product, an experience, even an entire built environment, at the service of the user -- a real flesh-and-blood person,\" Mr. Behar writes. </p><p>   Perhaps his most career-defining (and headline-grabbing) work was for One Laptop Per Child, an ambitious initiative, launched in 2005 by MIT Media Lab's Nicholas Negroponte, with the goal of putting $100 computers into the hands of millions of children in developing countries. The project ultimately flopped. The laptops cost roughly double the projected price (which was still only 10% of the cost of comparable devices in the developed world), and when they broke, there was little support to fix them. Beset by criticism, OLPC became a symbol of Western hubris, but it was also a shining example of how designers can leverage their talents for humanitarian good. </p><p>   Moshe Safdie is no stranger to idealistic design experiments and their failures. At the start of his career, the architect made a splash with his forward-thinking project Habitat, a housing complex built for Expo 67 in Montreal as an alternative to suburban sprawl. Habitat consisted of prefabricated units arranged in a stepped-back stack, allowing each apartment to have its own roof garden -- an amenity typically reserved for single-family homes. </p><p>   As Mr. Safdie recalls in his intriguing memoir, \"If Walls Could Speak\" (Atlantic Monthly, 368 pages, $32.50), in the early planning stages for Habitat he and his team resorted to using pieces of Lego to help figure out how the apartments would fit together, thereby using the bricks exactly as Kristiansen's son, Godtfred, predicted. \"In the future,\" Godtfred wrote, \"more and more houses will be built entirely of standard elements according to our modular system, without significant labor on the building site.\" </p><p>   After many false starts, Mr. Safdie was only able to replicate his vision as a high-end apartment complex in Singapore. Now, post-Covid, he hopes that some cities are primed for innovation. \"My aspiration has always been to find a way in which to transform the design process so that it has the kind of organic fitness that is always present in nature's designs,\" he writes. </p><p>   The built environment is certainly in need of reform. Buildings contribute roughly 40% of the world's emissions. Fortunately, like Mr. Safdie, scientists are also taking cues from nature to find answers to some of our biggest problems. In \"Nature's Wild Ideas: How the Natural World Is Inspiring Scientific Innovation\" (Greystone, 288 pages, $27.95), the science journalist Kristy Hamilton engagingly describes more than a dozen promising endeavors, from a water-harvesting system based on how fog condenses on the needles of redwood trees to \"bio-bricks,\" an alternative to concrete grown in labs like coral. </p><p>   Tragically, these valuable sources of innovation are quickly dwindling. \"We are losing species faster than we can discover them,\" Ms. Hamilton laments. \"It's as if we are burning a library without bothering to explore what the books contain.\" If we're to minimize the damage, it's critical that we invest in more sustainable materials and practices, nature-inspired or otherwise. For its part, Lego -- which uses 110,000 tons of plastic every year -- recently announced its first prototype brick made from recycled bottles. Even a design classic sometimes needs an update. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Lanks is a New York-based editor and writer. </p><p></p>",
