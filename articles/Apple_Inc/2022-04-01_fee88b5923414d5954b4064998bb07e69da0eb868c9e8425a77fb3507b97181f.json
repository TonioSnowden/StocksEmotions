  "text": "<p>The area where I grew up in Astoria, Queens, was peaceful and family-oriented. Many of the people who lived there spoke their home-country language first and English as a second language.</p><p>At our family bakery, Walken's, everyone who worked in the front and back spoke German. The owners of the grocery and butcher shop down the block spoke Italian. It was like growing up in Europe.</p><p>We lived in a small ground-floor apartment. I shared a bedroom with my younger brother, Glenn. My older brother, Ken, had his own room.</p><p>My mother and father came to America at about the same time in the 1930s. My mother, Rosalie, was from Scotland and my father, Paul, was from Germany. They both were adults when they got here, and both had escaped hard times.</p><p>My father's father was a baker, and his brothers were bakers. By the time he left Germany, he was a baker, too. In New York, he worked for a baker before opening Walken's.</p><p>My mother was a homemaker who was smitten with show business. She was passionate about the movies and the theater, especially musicals. She asked people to call her Roz, after actress Rosalind Russell. My real name is Ronald. I was named after actor Ronald Colman.</p><p>My father worked hard and was a quiet man. My mother had the big personality. When I was 5, she had me take dance lessons until age 8, when I started dance school in Astoria.In those days, that's where families sent kids. It wasn't a showbiz thing. Boys went for tap and girls went for ballet.</p><p>Both of my parents loved the movies. We'd get on the subway and arrive in Times Square in 15 minutes. Sitting in the dark and watching actors who were larger than life, my imagination grew. I wanted to do what they did.</p><p>I wasn't especially sensitive as a kid. Actually, I was kind of wild and noisy and would run around a lot while people told me to sit down and shut up.</p><p>My first part came at age 5, as an extra in a local amateur production of the play \"Madame Butterfly.\" When television arrived at the start of the 1950s, the networks needed programming. Lots of radio shows were adapted for TV, and the many family-oriented shows were constantly in need of kids for parts. You didn't necessarily have to be a child actor. If you could sing and dance a little and say a line or two, you were in. Auditions took place all the time.</p><p>My mother belonged to something called the Stage Mothers Society. She also read the Ross Report and Variety where auditions were listed.</p><p>My mother didn't push me or my brothers into acting. She pushed us into show business. Acting opportunities were just more plentiful. My brother, Ken, was a regular on \"The Guiding Light\" radio soap. When he was busy with a TV show, I'd do his voice because we sounded alike.</p><p>After high school, my father wanted me to work full time at his bakery. He had a good business, and I had worked there delivering wedding cakes. But I was drawn to the stage and thought I'd be in musical theater. A friend urged me to audition for a play, so I did and got the part.</p><p>Then I landed the role of a director in Robert Frank's \"Me and My Brother.\" Small parts followed. My first big movie part was in \"Next Stop, Greenwich Village,\" in 1976.</p><p>Today, my wife, Georgianne, a casting director, and I live in Connecticut in a comfortable, old wooden country house on a few acres. We moved here 45 years ago.</p><p>Our house abuts a nature sanctuary that's full of animals, so we have a beautiful unobstructed view. I don't live in L.A. I stay in a hotel when I'm out there making movies.</p><p>At home, I love to cook, but I don't eat cake or ice cream. We always had that around when I was a kid. I had my fill.</p><p>---</p><p>As told to Marc Myers</p><p>---</p><p>Christopher Walken, 79, is an Oscar-winning actor who has appeared in more than 100 films, including \"The Deer Hunter\" and \"Catch Me If You Can.\" He co-stars in the Apple TV+ series \"Severance\" and the Prime Video series \"The Outlaws.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Christopher's Counter</p><p>You work while cooking?</p><p>I do. I read scripts on the kitchen counter.</p><p>Process?</p><p>I read my lines, semi-out loud, over and over. Slowly, I memorize them.</p><p>Character?</p><p>As I memorize, I start to notice things about my character and develop his personality.</p><p>Lesson?</p><p>As an actor, it doesn't matter if an audience knows what you're talking about. They just need to know you know what you're talking about. There's a big difference.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
