  "text": "<p>2021 Genesis G90</p><p>Starting price:&#xa0;$73,975&#xa0;</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;Competitive price; lots of standard features; choice of engines, including a V8; class-leading powertrain warranty; optional all-wheel drive.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;Lacks prestige of traditional European brands; ride quality over handling; generic interior.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;The flagship of Hyundai's luxury brand, the 2021 Genesis G90, offers luxury and a full complement of standard features at a price thousands below its European competitors. It lacks their brand cachet, however, and the ride is tuned more for comfort than performance.</p><p>Also read:Time is running out to buy a gas-powered Rolls-Royce</p><p>2021 Bentley Flying Spur V8</p><p>BentleyStarting price:&#xa0;$198,725</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;Beautiful cabin; loads of customization options; incredible acceleration; standard all-wheel drive; brand cachet.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;Hugely expensive; poor fuel economy; active safety tech isn't standard.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;Extravagant and powerful, the 2021 Bentley Flying Spur V8 is enormously quick and surprisingly nimble given its size. Prices start just under $200,000 and get close to $300,000 with options. Fuel economy is dismal.</p><p>G90 vs. Flying Spur: New World meets old world</p><p>Genesis G90</p><p>A full-size luxury sedan with loads of standard features and either a twin-turbo V6 or an available V8, the 2021 Genesis G90 is a very attractive option in its segment, priced significantly lower than many of its competitors.</p><p>While there is a Sport setting improving throttle response and tightening up the suspension, the goal of the G90 is to provide its driver and passengers with a calm, comfortable ride on long journeys. Rear-wheel drive is standard, although all G90 sedans can also be optioned with all-wheel drive.</p><p>You might like:The Lamborghini Hurac√°n STO is powerful, exotic, and breathtakingly special</p><p>Handsome and sophisticated, the G90 is well-made and full of Nappa leather, smooth wood, and stainless steel speaker grilles. If there's one complaint, the interior still has a bit of a mass-market appeal, revealing its Hyundai HYMTF roots.</p><p>Despite its relatively low price, even the base model is extremely well-equipped, with such features as heated/ventilated power-adjustable front seats and heated rear seats. You also get satellite radio, a 17-speaker/900-watt Lexicon surround-sound system, and a 12.3-inch infotainment interface.</p><p>A suite of safety features is also standard, including lane-keeping assistance, forward-collision mitigation, a 360-degree camera system, and blind-spot monitoring. Resale values are average, but as with all Hyundais, the 2021 G90 includes a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty and three years of free maintenance.</p><p>Bentley Flying Spur V8</p><p>Along with Rolls-Royce, Bentley occupies the absolute top tier of automotive luxury, but unlike its fellow Brit, Bentley is more focused on performance. So while there is also a Bentley Flying Spur powered by a 6.0-liter W12, for purposes of this comparison, we will be looking at the new-for-2021 Bentley Flying Spur V8.</p><p>Rest assured, the V8-powered Bentley is no slouch, making a rather monstrous 542 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque and handling surprisingly well, particularly considering its nearly 5,500-pound curb weight and 17-foot length. Unsurprisingly, fuel economy from the twin-turbo V8 is rather ghastly. Bentley offers a hybrid Flying Spur with a V6 paired with an electric motor for the environmentally conscious.</p><p>Inside, the Flying Spur is as expected, trimmed with beautiful wood, acres of soft leather, and real metal accents. There is ample space for five, although trunk space is about average. The interior has a proper old-world feel, with just the right touch of modern, including a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and both Apple AAPL CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.</p><p>Being a Bentley, there is an option to have the screen rotate down into the dashboard, replaced with analog dials showing time, outside temperature, and a compass. One knock against the Flying Spur is most driver-assistance features are only available as options.</p><p>Check out: Carlos Santana Selling Another Kauai Retreat for $4.8M</p><p>There is no end to customization options, with either a Bang &amp; Olufsen BGOUF or Naim MY:5073 top-level audio systems on offer, a rear refrigerator for cooling your Champagne, a 4-seat configuration for more rear passenger elbow room, massaging seats, and any number of wood, leather, and interior color combinations. However, this is a Bentley, so any of those options will cost you and can easily push the price toward the $300,000 range.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Choice of engines; large back seat; quiet cabins.</p><p>2021 Genesis G90 advantages</p><p>Significantly less expensive; long warranty; larger trunk.</p><p>2021 Bentley Flying Spur advantages</p><p>More power; standard all-wheel drive; exquisite interior; opulence galore.</p><p>Which one is right for you?</p><p>To compete in the top tier of luxury sedans, Genesis has a lot to do, and the&#xa0;2021 Genesis G90&#xa0;is an impressive effort. It offers some excellent engines, a comfortable and cosseting interior, a full complement of luxury features, and a class-leading warranty, at a price many thousands (or tens of thousands) less than its competitors.</p><p>There's nothing quite like the 2021 Bentley Flying Spur. Big, brash, and reeking of wealth from every pore of its walnut interior, the Flying Spur makes extraordinary power with its twin-turbo V8 and is wonderful fun to drive. It costs more than most U.S. homes.</p><p>Compare the specs:</p><p>2021 Genesis G90         2021 Bentley Flying Spur  Popular Powertrains  Engine                       3.3-liter turbo V6       4.0-liter turbo V8  Horsepower                   365 hp @ 6,000 rpm       542 hp @ 6,000 rpm  Torque                       376 lb-ft @ 1,300 rpm    568 lb-ft @ 2,000 rpm  Transmission                 8-spd automatic          8-spd automatic  Fuel Economy                 19 mpg (17 city/24 hwy)  19 mpg (16 city/26 hwy)  Also Available               5.0-liter V8; AWD        6.0-liter W12; 2.9-liter V6 hybrid  Specs  Basic warranty               5 years/60,000 miles     3 years/unlimited miles  Powertrain Warranty          10 years/100,000 miles   3 years/unlimited miles  NHTSA Overall Safety Rating  n/a                      n/a  Max Seating Capacity         5                        5  Wheelbase                    124.4 inches             125.8 inches  Overall Length               204.9 inches             209.3 inches  Width                        75.4 inches              77.9 inches  Height                       58.9 inches              58.4 inches  Turning Diameter             39.2 feet                36.3 feet  Headroom, Front              41.1 inches              37.4 inches  Headroom, Rear               38.0 inches              37.0 inches  Legroom, Front               46.3 inches              41.9 inches  Legroom, Rear                37.8 inches              42.9 inches  Shoulder Room, Front         59.1 inches              n/a  Shoulder Room, Rear          57.9 inches              n/a  EPA Passenger Volume         113.2 cubic feet         108 cubic feet  EPA Cargo Volume             15.7 cubic feet          14.8 cubic feet</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
