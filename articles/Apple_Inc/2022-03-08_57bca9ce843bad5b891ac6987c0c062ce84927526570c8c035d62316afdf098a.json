  "text": "<p>    Samsung Electronics Co. said hackers breached its security system and accessed company data relating to its Galaxy devices. </p><p>   The South Korean electronics company said on Monday that it was recently made aware of the breach, which included some source code for Galaxy phones. </p><p>   \"Immediately after discovering the incident, we strengthened our security system,\" the company said. </p><p>   The data that were stolen included source code for the operation of Galaxy phones, the company said. </p><p>   The stolen material didn't include personal information of consumers or employees, the company added. </p><p>   The smartphone maker said it didn't anticipate any impact to its business or customers. </p><p>   Samsung said it also implemented measures to prevent further incidents. </p><p>   Samsung's line of Galaxy phones is one of the biggest competitors to Apple Inc.'s iPhone and a major source of revenue for the South Korean company. </p><p>   Samsung didn't say who was behind the breach. </p><p>   A hacking group, Lapsus$, said on its Telegram channel over the weekend that it had obtained source code and other confidential material from Samsung. </p><p>   Lapsus$ also recently said it took data from chip maker Nvidia Corp. </p><p>   After discovering the breach, Nvidia said last month it consulted with cybersecurity incident response experts and notified law enforcement. </p><p>   In a series of messages posted to Telegram, the Lapsus$ group said it stole 1 terabyte of data from Nvidia. </p><p>   The hacking group has demanded that the company release the source code for some of its products and also remove limitations in code that makes Nvidia's chips inefficient for the mining of cryptocurrency. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Robert McMillan contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
