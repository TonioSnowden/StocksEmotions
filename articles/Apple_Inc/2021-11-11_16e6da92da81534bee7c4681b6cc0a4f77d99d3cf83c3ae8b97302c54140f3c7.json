  "title": "Miners Face Pressure to Curb Emissions --- Activists are pushing producers to set targets for air pollution linked to their products",
  "text": "<p>Ground zero for this fight is steelmaking, which is responsible for 7% of world-wide carbon-dioxide emissions from energy consumption, according to the International Energy Agency. Global miners including Rio Tinto PLC and BHP Group Ltd. make most of their earnings from selling iron ore to steel producers.</p><p>Rio Tinto recently committed to spend $7.5 billion to cut emissions from its own operations by 50% this decade, but it stopped short of imposing targets on customers' pollution.</p><p>Separately, a climate plan released by BHP wasn't backed by 17% of proxy votes at its annual shareholder meeting in London on Oct. 14. Glass, Lewis &amp; Co., a proxy adviser, recommended shareholders vote against BHP's climate proposal, partly because the miner's plan to tackle Scope 3 emissions -- pollution mostly created when customers burn or process its commodities -- was vague.</p><p>\"Our message to Rio and other companies is that Scope 3 emissions represent both potential counterparty and reputational risk for companies,\" said Debby Blakey, chief executive of Hesta, an Australian pension fund. \"Failure to effectively manage these risks could negatively impact a company's long-term value and their ongoing social license to operate.\"</p><p>The world's biggest miners are increasingly collaborating with steelmakers to find ways to make steel production less polluting. But miners say they need the steel industry to map out a pathway to achieving net-zero emissions.</p><p>Some believe it is the responsibility of miners to find a solution, said Rohitesh Dhawan, chief executive of the International Council on Mining and Metals, an industry group that counts BHP, Rio Tinto and Glencore PLC as members.</p><p>\"There's little you can do, without being a steel producer, to reduce emissions of steel production,\" Mr. Dhawan said.</p><p>The World Steel Association, whose members represent about 85% of global steel production, said the industry is committed to reducing its carbon footprint, but that breakthrough technologies are needed to cut emissions materially. Mining companies say they can't ignore the problem of their customers' emissions. Without iron ore and metallurgical coal, the world wouldn't be able to make the steel that it needs for apartments, bridges and other infrastructure. Yet more than 70% of Rio Tinto's Scope 3 emissions come from customers turning its iron ore into steel.</p><p>Some miners have set targets. Brazilian iron-ore producer Vale SA wants to cut net Scope 3 emissions by 15% by 2035 and recently created a new briquette that it says produces less pollution when used in steelmaking. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. aims to have neutral Scope 3 emissions by 2040, including through investment in clean hydrogen.</p><p>Anglo American PLC, which also produces some iron ore and steelmaking coal, last month said it would aim for a 50% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2040, although the miner said that would largely depend on the pace of decarbonization in the steel industry.</p><p>Miners that are slow to act could lose business, according to investors and mining executives. Influential consumer brands are pushing suppliers to deliver carbon-free commodities. Apple Inc. last year said that by 2030 every device it sells will have been produced with no net release of carbon into the atmosphere.</p><p>Some mining executives say they fear inaction could make them a target of activist investors already taking on the oil industry. Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC recently took a large stake in Royal Dutch Shell PLC and is urging the oil giant to separate into two companies. Engine No. 1 LLC this year convinced Wall Street money managers to back a change in board oversight at Exxon Mobil Corp.</p><p>BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, is also pressing companies on climate issues. In a July report, BlackRock said it has asked miners, among others, how they will contribute to decarbonization and work toward Scope 3 disclosures and targets.</p>",
