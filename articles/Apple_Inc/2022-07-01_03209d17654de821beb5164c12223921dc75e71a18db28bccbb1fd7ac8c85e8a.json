  "text": "<p>I MADE MY FIRST hand pies the same summer I set out to learn magic. I was 8 years old, practicing rudimentary sleight of hand in my grandmother's house while she rolled and kneaded pastry. Driven by youthful imagination, inspired by the performance of some illusionists on television, I trotted around wearing a makeshift cape and a cardboard top hat. That was 30 years ago. I've forgotten most of what I gleaned from my short-lived obsession with abracadabra, but certain tricks I learned in the kitchen—transforming a heap of kitchen scraps into scrumptious, half-moon-shaped hand pies—stuck with me.</p><p>In a literal sense, a hand pie is nothing more than a small amount of filling enveloped in dough and either baked or fried. Yet 8-year-old me saw wizardry at work, and I've since seen others ooh and aah when they bite in and see the mysterious filling appear. These crowd-pleasing, pillowy pockets of surprise can also, magically, go anywhere with no need for dishes or utensils. </p><p>ROAD FOOD These cider-braised pork hand pies make a satisfying meal-on-the-go, no utensils necessary.

Where I live, in rural West Virginia, hand pies are traditionally shared when families and communities gather to boil sorghum, butcher hogs or cook apple butter after the fall harvest. Long, labor-intensive days call for portable, calorie-dense snacks. Homemade fruit hand pies are sold at markets near my house, while savory cousins such as Jamaican patties, Peruvian empanadas and Vietnamese beef pies are available just a short drive away.</p><p>I take two approaches to making hand pies. One is the same repurposing of ingredients I learned decades ago, a thrifty reliance on the hand pie to use up kitchen scraps that would otherwise go to waste. If I bake a standard, sliceable fruit pie, I'll at least have some leftover dough once I trim the top and bottom crusts. Odds are, I'll have extra filling as well. Why toss the excess when I can turn it into a few hand pies with minimal effort? Combine and reroll the dough, cut it into small discs, add a spoonful of filling, fold over, fork-crimp, then bake to a crispy, golden brown. </p><p>Find the recipe for Peach-Basil Hand-Pie Filling below PHOTO: Jenny Huang for The Wall Street Journal, Food Styling by Pearl Jones, Prop Styling by Sophie Strangio</p><p>Though I enjoy hand pies throughout the year, they're primarily on my mind—and on the menu at Lost Creek Farm, where I live, farm and produce a dinner series with my wife, Amy Dawson—during the summer months, when blueberries and blackberries ripen and stone fruits are at their juiciest. During this season, I approach hand pies as my primary objective, not a byproduct.</p><p>Hand pies can be sweet or savory, small or substantial enough for a meal. Regardless of size, I appreciate the hand pie as a blank canvas to build layers of flavor, either sharp contrasts or a sfumato of complementary ingredients tucked inside a buttery, flaky crust. For savory combinations, think unctuous braised pork with tangy pickled greens, or peppery sausage balanced with the sweetness of fresh pears. Some of my favorite summertime dessert combinations are ripe peaches and fresh basil; plump blueberries with fresh ginger; and a heavily spiced mock-apple hand pie made with early-season green tomatoes. Resist the temptation to overfill, and chop the fruit for the filling smaller than you would for a standard pie.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, I'll size up ingredients for seasonal hand pies, squeezing peaches for ripeness and harvesting a few gallons of berries from the fruit orchard on my farm. Summer is still a time for making magic.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Share your experience with these recipes. Did you make any adaptations?
