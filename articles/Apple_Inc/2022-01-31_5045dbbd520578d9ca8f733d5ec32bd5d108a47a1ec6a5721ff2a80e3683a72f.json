  "title": "Neil Young Pushes Amazon Music to Fans After Pulling Content From Spotify Amid Joe Rogan Controversy; Musician offers link where new Amazon Music subscribers can receive four months free, then pay $7.99 a month afterward for streaming service",
  "text": "<p>\"Amazon has been leading the pack in bringing Hi-Res audio to the masses, and it's a great place to enjoy my entire catalog in the highest quality available,\" Mr. Young said, referring to high-resolution audio. He also thanked streaming services Apple Music and Qobuz for \"sticking with my High-Res music.\"</p><p>The four-months free link that Mr. Young touted appears to be a better promotion relative to what Amazon Music typically provides to new subscribers. On its website, Amazon Music offers both Prime and non-Prime members the option for 30 days free before charging a monthly fee.</p><p>Representatives for Mr. Young and Amazon didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Streaming services that carry Mr. Young's music have been promoting it in the days since he pulled his content from Spotify. Hi-fi streaming service Tidal, which Mr. Young has championed for its sound quality, retweeted a fan's observation: \"Love that Neil Young is trending on Tidal\" and then shared a meme welcoming fresh recruits.</p><p>Apple Music tweeted: \"It's always a good idea to stream @NeilYoungNYA,\" while including a link to its Neil Young Essentials playlist.</p><p>Satellite-radio company SiriusXM, a unit of Liberty Media Corp., announced last week the return of \"Neil Young Radio,\" a satellite and streamed channel featuring Mr. Young introducing his songs and telling stories.</p><p>Spotify is the world's most popular music subscription streaming service, capturing 31% of the market in the second quarter of 2021, according to a report from MIDiA Research. Apple Inc.'s streaming-music service has a 15% market share and Amazon Music is third, capturing 13% of the market.</p><p>In posts to his website last week, Mr. Young thanked his label and Hipgnosis Songs Fund Ltd., which bought 50% of his publishing copyrights last year, for supporting his decision to pull his music from Spotify. He highlighted that 60% of his streaming income comes from the service.</p><p>But streams of Mr. Young's music increased for the week ending Jan. 27, according to MRC Data, formerly Nielsen Music, which powers the Billboard charts. On-demand streams rose 11% from the week before, despite his music being off Spotify for two of the period's days. Total album sales, including physical copies and digital downloads, rose 50%, as some fans opted to purchase Mr. Young's music on iTunes.</p><p>Mr. Young touting other streaming services comes as other artists, including folk singer Joni Mitchell and rocker Nils Lofgren have sought to remove their music from Spotify.</p><p>Mr. Rogan late Sunday apologized and said he aimed to be more balanced and informed about controversial topics and guests. He said his show has grown \"out of control\" and said, \"If I pissed you off, I'm sorry,\" referring to the growing backlash against him and Spotify.</p><p>\"It's a strange responsibility to have this many viewers and listeners,\" Mr. Rogan said in a 10-minute video posted on Instagram. \"It's nothing that I've prepared for. I'm going to do my best to balance things out.\"</p><p>Spotify shares rose about 13% on Monday, recovering some of the stock's losses in January. The controversy with Mr. Rogan has been a black cloud over Spotify with Mr. Young and others pulling their music, said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. The stock lost about one-fifth of its value in January.</p><p>\"Spotify made a major bet on Joe Rogan and its streaming music and podcast worlds are now colliding,\" he said. \"Spotify finally laying out its Covid-19 content rules along with Rogan's apology are giving the Street comfort today that this hot potato situation will not unravel further with more damage to the Spotify brand.\"</p><p>Spotify earlier Sunday made public its policies, which it didn't alter, and created a Covid-19 information hub.</p><p>\"We haven't been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,\" said Chief Executive Daniel Ek in a blog post Sunday. \"It's become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely accepted information from the medical and scientific communities guiding us through this unprecedented time.\"</p><p>News Corp's Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a content partnership with Spotify's Gimlet Media unit.</p><p>THE UNFOLDING OF THE SPOTIFY CONTROVERSY</p><p>* Joe Rogan Apologizes, Spotify Publishes Content Policy in Response to Neil Young Outcry (Jan. 31)</p><p>* Joni Mitchell Removes Music From Spotify in Support of Neil Young Against Joe Rogan (Jan. 28)</p><p>* Neil Young's Radio Channel on SiriusXM Is Revived After Spotify Removal (Jan. 27)</p><p>* Spotify Takes Down Neil Young's Music After His Joe Rogan Ultimatum (Jan. 26)</p><p>* Neil Young Demands Spotify Remove His Music Over Joe Rogan's Vaccine Comments (Jan. 25)</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com</p><p>Neil Young Pushes Amazon Music to Fans After Pulling Content From Spotify Amid Joe Rogan Controversy</p>",
