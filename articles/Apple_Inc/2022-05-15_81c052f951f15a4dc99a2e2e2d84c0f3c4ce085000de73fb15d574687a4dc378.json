  "title": "Russian Soldiers Shot Three Brothers and Threw Them in a Ditch. One Survived. Mykola Kulichenko's account is the basis of one of many war-crimes cases Ukrainian prosecutors are building against Russia",
  "text": "<p>Soldiers pushed Mykola into the grave on top of Yevgen. He felt Dymytro's weight land on him, then more pressure. Someone was shoveling earth over them.</p><p>\"I realized I was alive,\" said 33-year-old Mykola. The bullet had skimmed along the upper jaw on the inside of his cheek without causing any major damage.</p><p>Surviving execution was just the beginning. Ahead of him lay a harrowing journey home, evading Russian forces along the way.</p><p>Mr. Kulichenko's account forms the basis of one of thousands of cases Ukrainian prosecutors are building against Russian forces they accuse of perpetrating war crimes, including summary executions, torture and rape.</p><p>Ukraine's prosecutor general last month filed war-crimes charges against 10 Russian soldiers accused of taking civilians hostage and mistreating them in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where evidence of mass killings emerged after Moscow pulled back from the capital in March. The first war-crimes trial began Friday, involving a captured Russian soldier accused of killing a 62-year-old unarmed civilian. Moscow has denied committing war crimes or targeting civilians.</p><p>Mr. Kulichenko's story was corroborated by Ukrainian officials, family members and people he encountered after his brothers were executed.</p><p>Russian forces entered the village of Dovzhyk days after President Vladimir Putin launched the Ukraine invasion on Feb. 24. Armored vehicles thundered along the road in front of the house the brothers shared with their sister, Iryna, 36.</p><p>They kept out of sight of Russian troops, using the windows at the back of the house to come and go. Yevgen had reason to hide: The 30-year-old had fought against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine as a paratrooper before resigning from the military. He was working on a local farm with 36-year-old Dymytro when Russia invaded, but tried to hitch a ride to Zhytomyr to rejoin his unit, according to Mr. Kulichenko and his sister.</p><p>Residents of Dovzhyk say Russian forces left them largely undisturbed until March 18. On that day, Ukrainian security officials said, a convoy of Russian vehicles was hit by shelling and drove over a land mine on the road through the village.</p><p>Russian soldiers began scouring the village of about 570 residents for anyone who might have been involved. They went from house to house asking whether anyone had served in the military, inspecting men's torsos for tattoos and telltale bruising, according to residents. The head of the village, Nina Kurylo, said Russian soldiers searched her attic and cellar for weapons.</p><p>Iryna was out when a Russian Tigr military vehicle drew up outside the siblings' modest wooden bungalow at around 4 p.m. Two Russians entered the yard and demanded the brothers' documents, Mr. Kulichenko said. He described how they were made to strip to the waist and kneel by the fence. More soldiers arrived, and two went inside to search the house.</p><p>Soon they emerged with the bag Yevgen had packed for Zhytomyr, containing ammunition and his old uniform, Mr. Kulichenko said. They dropped it on the ground next to the brothers.</p><p>\"Who here is military?\" one of them asked.</p><p>\"I am,\" Yevgen said.</p><p>Russian soldiers made the three brothers get into one of the vehicles and asked the neighbors for bags, which they put over the brothers' heads after transferring them to another vehicle by the village bus stop, Mr. Kulichenko said. A draft kept blowing back the sack over his head, and he caught glimpses of the road out of Dovzhyk before the Russian guard pulled it back down.</p><p>His sister returned home to find belongings strewn in the yard and her brothers gone. Frantic, she asked neighbors where they might have been taken. Nobody knew.</p><p>Eventually the vehicle the brothers were in stopped. Russian soldiers removed the bags from their heads, and blindfolded them with medical bandage and tape, Mr. Kulichenko said.</p><p>Two men took him away from his brothers and asked about Yevgen: Where had he served? For how long? What was his rank? Why weren't any of them married? The brothers spent the night in a cold basement with about a dozen other men. At one point, Mr. Kulichenko's arms grew sore from being tied behind him. He asked the guards to tie his arms in the front instead, which they did.</p><p>The interrogations continued the next day, Mr. Kulichenko said. Russian soldiers wanted to know who had informed Ukrainian forces about the location of the column. When Mr. Kulichenko said he didn't know, they beat him with the butt of a rifle in the back and legs. One of them put a blade to his throat and threatened to cut off his ears, he said.</p><p>He heard his brothers cry out in pain as they were interrogated in turn. In the basement, they were forbidden to speak. Other prisoners caught trying to communicate were taken outside and beaten.</p><p>The following day, there were no beatings. The Russians offered the brothers cigarettes and chatted with them. Mr. Kulichenko began to hope their ordeal was coming to an end.</p><p>Three days after the brothers were taken, on March 21, the unit that had detained the brothers in Dovzhyk came back and the beatings resumed, Mr. Kulichenko said. He was struck on the head with a heavy object. He was barely conscious as Russian soldiers bound his legs and bundled him into the back of a vehicle with his brothers, he said.</p><p>When it came to a stop, they were dragged out and lined up on their knees. Mr. Kulichenko, who was blindfolded, heard someone digging a ditch and several voices around him.</p><p>He heard the clack of a silenced weapon. He turned toward the sound of a second shot. The next bullet hit him beneath the right ear. The hood of his jacket was up, which he believes saved him by obscuring the angle of his head to the person aiming the gun behind him.</p><p>In the grave, blood streamed down Mr. Kulichenko's neck as earth was shoveled over him. It was becoming difficult to breathe. If this was the end, he thought, at least he would be with his brothers. Yevgen wasn't moving and he heard Dymytro heave a last breath. Then everything was still.</p><p>Mr. Kulichenko mustered his strength and dragged himself out of the grave, which wasn't fully covered. He managed to remove the blindfold and rope around his legs, but his wrists were too tightly bound, he said. He kicked more earth onto the grave to cover his brothers, then made his way to a road. He didn't know where he was, but he had to find a way home without running into Russian forces. He headed away from the sound of a generator, figuring it might come from the Russian military.</p><p>Night was falling. He walked a short stretch along the road until he reached a cluster of houses. The moon was bright enough to make out the name of the village on a sign: Chumak. Aching and exhausted, Mr. Kulichenko entered an empty house and found a knife, which he used to free his wrists, he said. To stay hidden, he dragged bedding down to a garden cellar used to store potatoes and curled up to rest.</p><p>Mr. Kulichenko regained his senses around dawn, he said. He set off through the fields toward smoke rising from chimney stacks. He knocked on the door of a house in the village of Buianky to ask for directions, but something about the elderly man who lived there aroused his suspicions. He went the opposite way from where the man had told him to go.</p><p>Farther along, he saw a young man starting up a motorcycle and approached him.</p><p>From her front porch, Valentina Rydia saw her son talking to Mr. Kulichenko and invited him in. It was around 7 a.m., she said, and he looked scared.</p><p>Ms. Rydia showed him to the bathroom so he could wash his face. He was shocked by his own reflection. \"It was the first time I had seen myself,\" he said. \"My cheek was all swollen.\"</p><p>She fed him fried eggs, potatoes, pickles and a cup of coffee. He struggled to eat because he had been beaten violently in the stomach, he told her, and the bullet had left an exit wound near his mouth. \"Blood was dripping from his ear onto the table,\" said Ms. Rydia. She found it hard to understand what he said because he was stammering badly, but the story spilled out of him.</p><p>Mr. Kulichenko didn't stay long, she said. He was in a hurry to get home and then return for his brothers' bodies. Ms. Rydia's son drew a map for him on a piece of paper, marking a route through an area where Russian forces didn't have a heavy presence.</p><p>The thought of what Russian soldiers might do if they caught her harboring a man who was on the run never occurred to Ms. Rydia. \"I just knew I had to help him,\" said the 55-year-old, who runs the local store. She gave Mr. Kulichenko a hat and sweater and sent him off with bread, onions and salo—cured pork fat—as well as rock candies and some cigarettes.</p><p>The distance to Dovzhyk is about 12 miles in a straight line. Mr. Kulichenko estimated his route was roughly twice that long. His feet blistered so he shed his shoes and continued barefoot across the fields. A man with a horse and cart gave him a lift part of the way, he said.</p><p>He was alone and on foot when he saw the familiar contours of his village at around 8 p.m., after 12 hours of walking.</p><p>He approached Dovzhyk through the forest and spotted a Russian tank beyond the tree line. He remained hidden, taking the back paths first to a friend's house and then to his father, Anatoliy.</p><p>He arrived on his father's doorstep, his face swollen and bleeding. \"Finally you're back!\" Anatoliy said. \"Where are the guys?\"</p><p>\"They're gone,\" Mr. Kulichenko replied.</p><p>Anatoliy's cries drew the neighbors. They began to panic that Russian soldiers would find Mr. Kulichenko. Iryna learned that her brother was back and rushed over.</p><p>Mr. Kulichenko needed medical attention, but taking him to hospital was risky. His father called a doctor, Natalia Bebko, who lives in a neighboring village. Over the next week, Dr. Bebko said, she advised the family over the phone how to treat the wounds.</p><p>As suddenly as they had arrived, the Russians were gone. On March 31, they pulled out of Dovzhyk in a broader retreat from northern Ukraine as the front line shifted east.</p><p>Mr. Kulichenko went to see Dr. Bebko at the hospital. His chest hurt, his lymph nodes and jaw were inflamed, the soft tissues inside his right cheek were shredded and his wrists were still raw from being tied. His mental state concerned her, she said, but the bullet wounds were healing.</p><p>On April 2, Mr. Kulichenko and his sister went to Chumak in search of their brothers' remains. Ukrainian forces sent them home because there were still mines in the area, they said.</p><p>They returned three days later but couldn't locate the grave. Time and trauma were distorting Mr. Kulichenko's memory. \"I became very confused,\" he said.</p><p>His sister sought help from local authorities but found they had little time or sympathy. She tried to piece together the fragments her brother had told her and tracked down Ms. Rydia in hope she might remember details her brother had subsequently forgotten. Iryna deduced that the gravesite was probably near a road, since her brothers' legs had been bound and they couldn't have walked far from the vehicle.</p><p>Eventually Ukrainian security services took up the case. \"At first it was hard to believe it was true,\" said one security services member.</p><p>The evidence, however, stacked up. Mr. Kulichenko led investigators to the cellar where he had spent the night in Chumak. The bloodstained bedding was still there when a Wall Street Journal reporter visited last month.</p><p>Nearby in Vyshneve, they searched the basement of a school that had served as a Russian headquarters—part of a sprawling military camp in an apple orchard, an old pig farm and a timber factory. SUVs parked around the school suggested the men inside were commanders, but they never introduced themselves and didn't wear insignia on their uniforms, according to the village head.</p><p>A hat belonging to one of the brothers was found in the timber factory.</p><p>In the orchard, Russian forces had used pine planks from the factory and empty wooden ammunition crates to build a canteen, a sauna and shower cubicles. Straw and insulation ripped from the roof of a potato farm were used in the sleeping quarters. Dozens of campsites suggest hundreds of soldiers were stationed in Vyshneve, and the passage of tanks and heavy equipment has turned the ground to mud.</p><p>Mr. Kulichenko and his sister, with the help of authorities, still couldn't find the bodies.</p><p>On the fifth search attempt, a crime scene technician who accompanied Mr. Kulichenko encouraged him to trust his own instincts. \"Maybe your legs will remember,\" she said she told him.</p><p>He wandered off by himself and returned with his palm outstretched, she recalled. In it was an empty bullet casing fired from a Soviet-era Makarov pistol. He had found the grave nearby.</p><p>Investigators also found Mr. Kulichenko's blindfold, which still Iay in the grass on a subsequent visit by the Journal on April 29.</p><p>Yevgen and Dymytro's bodies were exhumed. They were among dozens that began arriving in the Chernihiv morgue after Russian forces retreated from the region. \"Unfortunately, they were not the first executed civilians,\" said forensic pathologist Yuriy Fenenko. \"Nor were they the last.\"</p><p>On April 21, exactly one month after the execution, their two coffins lay side by side in the Kulichenkos' yard. It would have been Dymytro's 37th birthday. Dymytro and Yevgen's bodies had decomposed too far to be displayed in an open casket, as is customary in Orthodox Christian funerals.</p><p>About 100 residents of the village turned out for the funeral. Father Mikolai Mariboroda led the procession through Dovzhyk to the graveyard, past a Russian checkpoint still littered with military ration packs and cigarette butts. The brothers were laid to rest beside their mother, who died last year after a long illness.</p><p>Their father works as the village gravedigger, but this burial was too much for him. He sat apart from the mourners on a bench. \"Glory to the heroes of our village, and glory to the heroes of Ukraine!\" said Ms. Kurylo, the village head, to those assembled.</p><p>As head of the Chernihiv region prosecutor's office, Serhiy Vasylya is responsible for gathering evidence of potential Russian war crimes across the region. The task of identifying individual suspects in the brothers' execution is only just beginning, he said, though his office has homed in on one unit of the Russian military.</p><p>Meanwhile, the security services are also looking for the Ukrainians they believe betrayed the brothers to the Russians. \"Someone told them,\" said the representative in charge of the investigation. The informers were likely bribed or coerced, he said, and should be rooted out in case the Russians return.</p><p>In the school that had served as their headquarters in Vyshneve, a Journal reporter found a map of Dovzhyk the Russians left behind. The homes of four individuals were marked. Security services suspect they are the informers.</p><p>Iryna thinks she knows who it was. \"I hope he will be held accountable under the law,\" she said, wringing a tissue in her hands.</p><p>Nina Tararuieva contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Isabel Coles at isabel.coles@wsj.com</p><p>Russian Soldiers Shot Three Brothers and Threw Them in a Ditch.
