  "title": "This Colorado Community Offers High-Life Living With a Little Less Altitude; Edwards (81632) has some of the area's priciest real estateâ€”even pricier than Vail",
  "text": "<p>Vail's tourism industry is the economic driver in Colorado's Vail Valley, but Edwards, ZIP Code 81632 and about 15 miles west of Vail, has the area's priciest residential real estate as ranked by median listing price, according to Realtor.com. (News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operatesRealtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.) It is bested only by Woody Creek and Snowmass, both in the same area as Aspen, and Telluride. An unincorporated Rocky Mountain community in Eagle County, Edwards has a locals' vibe with a busy downtown along the Eagle River. Driving Edwards's real-estate market up are Cordillera, a 7,000-acre gated community with more than 800 homesites, and Arrowhead Village, with access to Beaver Creek Resort. Both high-end developments have member clubs, golf courses and restaurants.</p><p>Membership to have</p><p>Several Vail Valley private clubs such as the Vail Mountain Club, in Vail Village near Gondola One, or the Arrowhead Alpine Club, at the base of Beaver Creek Resort's Arrow Bahn Express Lift, provide members with year round benefits, including a range of ski-in and ski-out amenities, from heated parking to ski-valet services to on-mountain dining, depending on the club.</p><p>Advice for the buyer</p><p>Compared with Vail, Edwards has a lower altitude (leading to better breathing and sleeping for many people), a warmer temperature and days with more sunlight for longer, says Suzi Apple, founder and owner of Gateway Real Estate in Vail Valley. \"The combination makes Edwards so appealing,\" she says. Ms. Apple also notes that Edwards has more neighborhood communities and schools to choose from, and world-class golfing, too.</p><p>On the Market</p><p>Spring Creek Lane</p><p>Located on 1.6 acres within the Cordillera Valley Club, this 9,404-square-foot property has direct Sawatch Range mountain views. There are five bedrooms and a one-bedroom caretaker's apartment with a separate entrance. There is an office, gym, movie theater, pool and hot tub. A covered patio has a fireplace, heater and grill. Agents: Aaron Rabins and Brooke Horan-Kates, Slifer Smith &amp; Frampton Real Estate.</p><p>Pilgrim Drive</p><p>Less than a 10 minute drive from downtown Edwards is this 9,384 square foot log home. It was built in 1996 and remodeled in 2015 and it sits on 7.25 acres within the Pilgrim Downs gated community. There are five bedrooms, an office, a library, a fitness room and an entertainment room, which were designed by top interior designer Thom Filicia. There is a large stone fireplace in the great room, which has a vaulted ceiling.

Outside there is a main deck with a pergola, privacy screens, and a fireplace. There is also a 1,000-square-foot apartment for guests.
