  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Steel Tariffs Cost America's Apple Growers",
  "text": "<p>   Regarding your editorial \"Now They're the Biden-Trump Tariffs\" (Oct. 27): Apple growers were innocent bystanders in that fight, yet they still pay for Section 232 tariffs in higher prices for tractors, trucks and apple-sorting and -handling equipment made from steel and aluminum. </p><p>   That's not all. When U.S. tariffs were imposed, India had just become the second-largest export market for U.S. apples. That an apple grown in the state of Washington can be shipped thousands of nautical miles from Seattle to Mumbai and still be delicious and affordable is a miracle of modern agriculture. India, however, retaliated against U.S. tariffs, including with import tariffs on U.S. apples, which now total 70%. From January 2019 to June 2022, the loss of the Indian market has cost U.S. apple growers more than $500 million in sales. </p><p>   Jim Bair </p><p>    President &amp; CEO, U.S. Apple Association </p><p>   Falls Church, Va. </p><p></p>",
