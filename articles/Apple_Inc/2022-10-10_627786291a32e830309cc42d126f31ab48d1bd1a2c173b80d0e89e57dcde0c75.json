It enters an all-new generation for 2023. Pricing starts at $88,400.</p><p>SUVs are becoming ubiquitous, but there are still a few options for drivers looking for a full-size, flagship luxury sedan. The Genesis G90 is one of the most competitive players in this shrinking class, and it goes toe-to-toe with longtime class leaders like the BMW XE:BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.</p><p>The G90 has a unique design that turns heads, and the interior is spacious and supremely luxurious. This Korean-built luxury sedan is available in two configurations. The base model is loaded with Nappa leather seats, a twin-turbo V8, and a digital gauge cluster. The upper trim adds features like an electric supercharger, reclining and massaging rear seats, and air suspension.</p><p>See: Luxury cars: Comparing the 2020 Genesis G90 with the Audi A8</p><p>2023 Genesis G90 pricing</p><p>The base model of the 2023 Genesis G90 starts at $88,400, and the upper trim with the E-Supercharger begins at $98,700.

We've been impressed by its twin-turbo V6 in other Genesis models, and we look forward to testing it with the available electric supercharger.</p><p>The ride quality promises to be supple yet controlled, thanks to the G90's standard electronically controlled suspension with Road Preview. It should be even better with the optional multi-chamber air suspension and rear-wheel steering.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>The interior of the Genesis G90 is spacious and luxurious. There's lots of legroom in both rows of seats, with plenty of room for the rear-seat passengers to stretch out. The interior design justifies the price tag, and the quality of the materials is top-notch.</p><p>Standard interior features include Nappa leather seating, matte-finish wood trim, a microfiber suede headliner, heated, ventilated, and massaging front seats with power bolsters, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, 3-zone climate control, power rear sunshades, a head-up display, and a wireless charging pad.</p><p>The standard infotainment system is a 12.3-inch screen complemented by a digital gauge cluster the same size. It's loaded with navigation, Android Auto, Apple AAPL CarPlay, SiriusXM SIRI, HD Radio, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen BGOUF audio system.</p><p>The upper trim gets more luxurious inside with a 3D audio system, a rear center console with touchscreen controls and wireless charging, plus ventilated, reclining, and massaging rear seats.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch: Former Apple car executive's battery startup plans $1.6 billion factory in Michigan</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The 2023 Genesis G90 has a striking exterior design that won't blend in with the crowd. Some of this luxury car's rivals are good if you're looking for subtlety, but if you want a premium sedan that stands out, the G90 can't be ignored.</p><p>The G90 is the biggest sedan in the Genesis lineup. It's a full-size sedan with dimensions similar to those of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Audi A8, and Lexus LS.</p><p>Also see: Vegan is trending in the auto industry, and it's not just about leather</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>1. Available E-Supercharger The optional electric supercharger is a welcome addition to the twin-turbo V6 under the hood of the G90. It boosts performance with an extra 34 horsepower and 14 lb-ft of torque over the base engine with only a slight penalty in fuel economy.</p><p>2. Virtual Venues Live This enhanced audio system is a virtual, 3D-surround sound function optimized for different types of music. It has settings like Boston Symphony Hall and Bang &amp; Olufsen Home, replicating the sound quality of real-life venues to make the most out of the 26-speaker sound system.</p><p>3. Opulent rear seats The front seats in the G90 are supremely comfortable, but the rear seats are arguably an even better place to be. Nappa leather seating is standard, and the upper trim of the G90 adds heated, ventilated, massaging, and reclining rear seats, plus a rear center console with touchscreen controls and a wireless charging pad.</p><p>4. Mood Curator This standard feature allows your passengers to set the mood in the G90 with themes like Vitality, Delight, Care, and Comfort.

It does more than just unlock and start your Genesis. The car recognizes the driver and loads your customized vehicle preferences.</p><p>6. Highway Driving Assist II This standard semi-autonomous driving system makes highway driving safer and more relaxed by combining features like adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and road sign assist.</p><p>You might like: The biggest challenge to being a successful investor</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>The base engine in the 2023 Genesis G90 is a powerful twin-turbocharged V6.
