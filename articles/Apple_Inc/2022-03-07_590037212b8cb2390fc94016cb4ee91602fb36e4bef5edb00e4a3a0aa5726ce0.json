  "title": "Samuel L Jackson steals the show in dementia drama The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey",
  "text": "<p>In the opening couple of minutes of <em>The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,</em> Samuel L Jackson pours himself a whisky and picks up a revolver. He is recording a message of valediction — as the titular Ptolemy — in which he talks about “setting things right” with someone. A series of violent bangs on his apartment door cuts him off and heralds that the time for score settling has come.</p> <p>The intense, booze-and-testosterone-scented introduction gives a misleading impression of this new six-part limited series, which is more of a slow and sombre character drama than a revenge thriller. After the prologue, we are cast back to two months earlier, when the same door is subjected to similarly insistent knocking. This visitor comes bearing groceries rather than threats. But Ptolemy, dishevelled and panic-stricken, is cowering inside. He's scarcely recognisable as being the same poised man from the first scene. In a sense, he isn't.</p> <p>For the second time in just three weeks, Apple TV Plus has released a programme that contemplates what constitutes the self and the connection between memory and identity. Where the excellent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/102ba3d3-1541-4879-80b0-b0e4525121e8\"><em>Severance</em></a> relied on sci-fi imaginings to tell its story of people who are artificially detached from their recollections, <em>The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey</em> is rooted in the harrowing everyday realities of living with dementia. </p> <p>This adaptation of Walter Mosley's novel provides a moving account of the bewildering existence endured by Jackson's Ptolemy. Haunted by spectral visions of past traumas, overwhelmed by a present populated by anonymous figures, he becomes completely reliant on the care of distant relatives. While he continues to forget, they, like grand-nephew Reggie (Omar Benson Miller), fondly remember the avuncular figure he was in better days. </p> <p>Occasionally, the relics of a charismatic personality shine through the dense fog. Perhaps more affecting than the slightly overwrought scenes of his wordless vexations are the moments of lucidity. “All a man is, is what he remembers,” he reflects, tragically aware of his decline into second infancy. </p> <p>While Jackson's turn is a late-career highlight (although not quite a match for Anthony Hopkins's role in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4220925a-698f-41e9-965b-5e17fcc8b64e\"><em>The Father</em></a>), the series feels almost overawed by the performance. The narrow focus on Jackson is at the expense of narrative urgency. The two central plot-points outlined in the show's promotional synopsis — Reggie's death, and Ptolemy undergoing a procedure developed by a Mephistophelian scientist (Walton Goggins) which can temporarily reverse dementia — are deferred for too long. </p> <p>True, some of that time is devoted to the touching friendship between Ptolemy and his new carer — an orphaned teen called Robyn (Dominique Fishback, superb) — towards whom he's instinctively protective. And our patience is rewarded to an extent, once Ptolemy's mind is restored (albeit for only two months). Having spent so much time immersed in his despair, it's a poignant joy to see him salvaged from the waste of his condition. He tells jokes, charms women and, so it seems, plans to mete out some justice. A busy schedule for those last days.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>Episodes 1-2 on Apple TV Plus globally from March 11; new episodes released weekly</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Samuel L Jackson steals the show in dementia drama The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey' FT.com 7 March.
