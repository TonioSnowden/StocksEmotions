  "title": "U.S. News: New Heat Wave Looms for the West --- Montana and other states activate more firefighting resources as blazes keep burning",
  "text": "<p>Western states have faced several record-setting heat waves this summer, including one in June that left more than 100 people dead in the Pacific Northwest. This bout of high temperatures likely won't last as long as previous heat waves, said Ms. Malingowski.</p><p>The sequence of heat waves in the region this year is unprecedented and has exacerbated drought and fire conditions, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>\"There really is no historical precedent for this magnitude of recurrent, record-breaking heat in the same part of the Western U.S.,\" Dr. Swain said. \"We've known for a long time this is where things were headed because climate change is dramatically increasing the likelihood of unprecedented, extreme heat events like we're seeing right now.\"</p><p>In Missoula, Mont., 2021 has had \"the hottest start to the summer\" on record, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>In many parts of the state, dead vegetation is the driest it has ever been at this point in the summer, which means it could more easily spark and spread wildfires, said Philip Higuera, a fire ecology professor at the University of Montana. The high temperatures could result in even more dry vegetation, including dead branches and downed logs that are typically too wet to burn. \"The longer that this heat continues, the more that gets ratcheted up,\" Dr. Higuera said.</p><p>Nationally, this fire season has so far been on par with previous years.</p><p>More than 70 large active fires have burned nearly 1 million acres across the West, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, with the largest number of fires burning in Idaho, Montana, Arizona and Oregon. Red-flag warnings, which indicate weather ripe for fast-spreading fires, are in effect in parts of several states, including Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Northern California, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>On Wednesday, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte declared a wildfire state of emergency, joining state officials in Washington, Oregon and Idaho in activating additional firefighting resources, if available. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday the state had deployed additional firefighting resources to Oregon.</p><p>The National Interagency Fire Center upgraded its national preparedness status to its highest level Wednesday, which means more large fires are burning and more firefighters are working to control them, with \"the potential to exhaust national wildland firefighting resources,\" according to the center. It is the earliest in the fire season the center has made such an upgrade in 10 years.</p><p>The largest fire currently burning is the 227,234-acre Bootleg Fire in south central Oregon. More than 1,700 firefighting personnel are battling the flames, which continue to pose challenges due to winds and dry vegetation.</p><p>The Red Apple Fire in Chelan County, Wash., prompted evacuation orders for 1,500 homes this week after sparking and quickly spreading Tuesday evening.</p><p>In California, 500 firefighters were battling steep and difficult terrain to contain the 2,250-acre Dixie Fire. The fire is burning in Northern California's Butte County near Paradise, where the devastating 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people.</p>",
