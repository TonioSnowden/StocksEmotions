The software giant's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a36dd469-e521-4ce7-9351-ddc8f6b5cb42\">plan</a> to buy <strong>Nuance Communications</strong> — whose speech recognition artificial intelligence technology powers <strong>Apple</strong>'s all-seeing virtual assistant — raises some questions.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's not that the software titan is new to mergers and acquisitions. It pulled off its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/931c2ade-3165-11e6-ad39-3fee5ffe5b5b\">largest deal</a> in 2016, when it purchased the professional social media network <strong>LinkedIn</strong> for $26bn, followed by smaller acquisitions of <strong>GitHub</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ba17784-6862-11e8-b6eb-4acfcfb08c11\">online service</a> used by some 28m software developers, and gaming companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74f3ca26-373c-4afb-89a9-ec4c1a94c0f5\"><strong>ZeniMax</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34ad6748-3cf1-11e4-a2ab-00144feabdc0\"><strong>Minecraft</strong></a>. Nuance would be its second-largest ever purchase, at an aggregate value of $20bn.</p> <p>But the deal does raise questions about Microsoft's strategy.</p> <p>The tie-up makes sense on some levels — Nuance and Microsoft were already partners, so combining will make it easier to tap into each other's respective customer bases. But the numbers don't quite add up, as the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9d37dac-95dd-4507-8474-7a46ab2e4bd3\">Lex column explains</a>.</p> <p>Nuance's revenue dropped 3 per cent in 2020, yet Microsoft's offer of $56 a share is more than twice what Nuance traded at before the pandemic. It's a drop in the bucket for Microsoft, whose market capitalisation is almost $2tn, and has $50bn in net cash, but an odd bet nevertheless.</p> <p>The AI group also shares little in common with Microsoft's other recent targets. After playing host to a revolving door of activists over the years, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d90d9c3e-139b-11e3-9289-00144feabdc0\">including</a> <strong>Carl Icahn</strong>, Nuance zeroed in on machine learning and natural language processing in the healthcare sector.</p> <p>“AI is technology's most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application,” Nadella <a href=\"https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1381587051431174144?s=20\">tweeted</a> on the logic behind the deal.</p> <p>Microsoft has spent the past year chasing a mishmash of social media companies as a means to bring large-scale applications to its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4042676-44d1-4836-9476-9f0aed62114b\">Azure cloud platform</a>.</p> <p>DD readers will be all too familiar with the Microsoft/TikTok/Trump saga from over the summer, but here's a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdf696fb-5d40-4ecd-a1d2-81007e59a23e\">recap</a> if you need one. Then in February, the FT revealed the software group had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f88b8474-e791-4efb-a9f6-54c8222680fe\">also courted</a> the social media platform <strong>Pinterest</strong>, which currently enlists rival <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> as its infrastructure provider.</p> <p>Microsoft has also been in discussions to acquire the chat app <strong>Discord</strong> in a deal that would likely value the company well above its last private mark, DD has heard.</p> <p>It's unclear where Nadella's latest emphasis on the importance of building out Microsoft's healthcare cloud offering fits into that mix. And the pivot might draw more attention than he's used to.</p> <p>While Nadella is regarded more like a tech scion than a seasoned dealmaker, he's been placing bets at a rate that would land any of his Silicon Valley peers at Amazon or<strong> Facebook</strong> in a meeting with regulatory authorities.&#xa0;</p> <p>The play for Nuance will probably test the Biden administration's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42f5b047-6b1f-4028-a428-0450d42c5650\">appetite</a> for allowing powerful technology companies to strike deals.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Cameron breaks his Greensill silence — and an inquiry follows</h2> <p>The intersection of finance and politics, or money and power, is a favourite theme for DD and our readers. So, we're watching the latest major development in the UK's growing Greensill scandal closely.&#xa0;</p> <p>Prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has commissioned an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ade87a61-b1e1-433a-a79f-25fc6b9a0aaf\">inquiry</a> that will look at former UK premier <strong>David Cameron</strong>'s lobbying on behalf of <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, the now-collapsed finance group.</p> <p><strong>Nigel Boardman</strong>, a former partner at <strong>Slaughter and May</strong>, will lead it.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a significant shift. Just three weeks ago Conservative MPs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84ca5ada-f916-47f0-b386-fd4d5790a0d1\">blocked</a> calls for an investigation by parliament's Treasury select committee.&#xa0;</p> <p>This could result in Cameron facing awkward questions about his advocacy for the company, which is particularly embarrassing since, before becoming PM, he said former ministers should not be “allowed to use their contacts and knowledge — gained while being paid by the public to serve the public — for their own private gain”.</p> <p>Reminder: Cameron had share options in Greensill, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3cf4459-dd54-49c1-a777-276f8ae0d406\">travelled on private jets</a> that were financed through <strong>Greensill Bank</strong>, whose management is now under criminal investigation in Germany.&#xa0;</p> <p>The investigation was announced hours after Cameron, who had remained silent on the story for weeks, released a 1,500-word statement admitting he made “mistakes” as he lobbied for Greensill, while maintaining that he didn't breach any lobbying rules or laws.</p> <p>The former prime minister, who was a public relations adviser before entering politics, said there were “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da2a2686-1efa-4fd4-bee4-79cc9d9a89a2\">lessons</a>” to learn about communications with the government.&#xa0;</p> <p>All of this comes after another huge FT story on the unfolding crisis. On Friday night we revealed that Greensill Capital made loans to <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>'s trading&#xa0;company on the basis of invoices that have raised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e450c8f9-29fa-432b-98fd-5885edb4680f\">suspicions of fraud</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The invoices purport to show Gupta's<strong> Liberty Commodities</strong> sold products to four metals businesses — but they deny any dealings with Gupta's group.</p> <p>“We are copper producers and don't even know what we would have bought from them,” the chief executive of one of the companies said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Johnson's shock decision to push for a full-blown inquiry is just the latest way that the Greensill story, which the FT has been doggedly pursuing for years, has broken into the political mainstream. Catch DD's Robert Smith talking about it on Sky News <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/status/1381222360074829825\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Suez Veolia, Habemus Papam&#xa0;</h2> <p>French finance minister <strong>Bruno Le Maire </strong>was “delighted”. Journalists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters_SarahW/status/1381581774879395840?s=20\">danced with joy</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The occasion? After being locked in a bitter months-long takeover battle, <strong>Suez</strong> and <strong>Veolia</strong> — the world's two biggest water and waste groups — have finally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7743e260-b70b-4c42-8e6c-feb7e8b9b2b1\">reached a deal</a>.</p> <p>Shareholders were also pretty happy, as Suez and Veolia were up 7.7 and 9.6 per cent, respectively, writes the FT's David Keohane from Paris.&#xa0;</p> <p>After months of backbiting, a poison pill, legal challenges, alternative proposals, interventions by market regulators and attempts at mediation by the French state, Veolia is buying its rival for €20.50 a share, higher than the €18 it had put on the table and which it paid to buy 29.9 per cent of Suez last year.</p> <p>It's also going to sell back a chunk of Suez to shareholders and private equity, creating a €7bn revenue company out of assets it was largely going to have to ship anyway to meet competition concerns. It was always <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d44048b-5338-4706-9feb-13ed09816bb2\">the most likely way</a> out of this mess.</p> <p>The tentative plan, which will allow for employees to jump in, is for private equity firms <strong>Ardian</strong>, <strong>GIP </strong>and <strong>Meridiam</strong> to take 40 per cent and <strong>Caisse des Dépôts</strong>, the French state investment arm, to take the rest. Suez says the new group probably won't be listed.&#xa0;</p> <p>All told, Veolia chief executive <strong>Antoine Frérot</strong> is a happier man today than he was last week.&#xa0;</p> <p>It remains to be seen how happy Suez boss <strong>Bertrand Camus</strong> is, despite securing shareholders a significant amount more money. Or whether he's going to run the “new Suez”.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Robert Kraft </strong><a href=\"https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/apollo/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&amp;FilingId=14863779&amp;CIK=0001411494&amp;Index=10000\">has resigned</a> as a member of <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>'s board, effective immediately.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</strong> has named <a href=\"http://news.freshfields.com/en/Global/r/6093/freshfields_appoints_22_new_partners\">22 new partners</a>, effective May 1.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>KPMG</strong>'s partners have approved the nomination of <strong>Jon Holt </strong>as the firm's chief executive in the UK. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce71ec50-fec9-4df6-ab5b-826c7fe51c96\">More here</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Millennium Management</strong>, one of the biggest hedge fund winners from last year's coronavirus-driven market turmoil, has hired three former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> partners: <strong>Paul Russo</strong>, <strong>Scott Rofey</strong> and <strong>Jeffrey Verschleiser</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bda53479-431f-45de-9c0a-8a53073680c2\">More here.</a></p></li>  <li><p><strong>Paul Weiss</strong> has hired <strong>David Tarr</strong>, the co-chair of<strong> Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher</strong>'s finance practice group, and <strong>Skadden Arps </strong>tax partner <strong>Brian Krause</strong> as partners in its corporate department.

But the paper's resistance to change and a long-brewing battle between its editor and its new publisher threaten stagnation.

The Archegos saga shows that many of the rules have yet to be implemented more than a decade later.
