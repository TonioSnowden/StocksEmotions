  "title": "Technology:  Ad Rebound Boosts New York Times Profit  ----  By Patience Haggin",
  "text": "<p>   New York Times Co. said net profit rose by 63% in the third quarter, boosted by a strong rebound in advertising revenue and continued subscription growth. </p><p>   The Times said it signed up 455,000 new digital subscribers in the quarter, 320,000 of which were for its core news offering and 135,000 were for lower-cost digital products such as its games, cooking and Wirecutter, the company's product-review site. </p><p>   \"This was our best third-quarter performance in both News and total net subscription additions since the launch of the digital pay model more than a decade ago,\" Chief Executive Meredith Kopit Levien said. </p><p>   The Times posted a net profit of $54.7 million, up from $33.6 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 19% to $509.1 million. </p><p>   Shares of New York Times fell 9.6% Wednesday after the earnings were released. </p><p>   For the first time, the publisher said it had more than one million digital subscriptions from outside the U.S. Overall, the company had more than 8.3 million paid subscriptions across its digital and print products -- about 5.7 million for its core digital news offering, 1.9 million for other digital products and about 800,000 for its print-based bundles. </p><p>   On a call to discuss the company's results, Ms. Kopit Levien said there are at least 100 million English-speaking, college-educated people who would pay for digital journalism and could subscribe to the Times, and that about half of them lived outside the U.S. </p><p>   The Times is facing comparisons to an anomalous year. In 2020, a blockbuster news cycle including a pandemic and U.S. presidential election led the company to its strongest year of subscription growth, while its advertising business suffered. </p><p>   The company reported advertising revenue of $110.9 million, up 40% from the year-earlier quarter. </p><p>   Subscription revenue was up 14% at $342.6 million, and the Times's other revenue, coming from operations such as live events, television series and affiliate and licensing businesses, rose 19% to $55.6 million. </p><p>   Ms. Kopit Levien said the Times didn't see a great impact from two trends that hit some other digital-ad businesses hard this quarter: Apple's new privacy policy and supply-chain constraints that affected marketers' willingness to spend. Because the Times advertising tends to be used to drive brand awareness, rather than drive immediate purchases, ad revenue was relatively shielded from both, she said. </p><p>   She said the advertising market could change pretty quickly and was dominated by very large platforms, \"so we don't rule out that there can be significant swings in any part of the business as a result of that.\" </p><p>   During the third quarter, the Times experimented with aggressively limiting access to journalistic content for nonsubscribers. This had a positive impact on subscriber starts, Ms. Kopit Levien said. </p><p></p>",
