  "text": "<p>We spent months talking about the essential workers in hospitals and nursing homes, but what about those in our homes? I mean the tradesmen who help when the toilet goes down or the wires get crossed. The best time to find a good electrician is 10 years ago.</p><p>In the favorites on my iPhone are Joe, Sean, Jon, Jim, Terry and Angel -- my electrician, plumber, body man, cleaning woman and handyman, listed by name, not trade. They appear amid family and friends, which is fitting because they are sort of family (usually with less baggage). Posting bail for brothers, buying plane tickets for girlfriends, helping with lawyers and even serving as best man are things that my kin haven't required of me. Then again, no one in my family can wield a caulking gun.</p><p>Most of our tradesmen know our house entry code and do work when we are out of town. More than a few times I approved work without asking for a price in advance, sure I'd be treated fairly. This trust works both ways. Izzy Goldberg was the most requested carpet mechanic I ever met, and he never installed a yard of carpet. He would sit down at the kitchen table with the housewives and coffee while his \"helpers\" moved the furniture and stretched in the carpet. The customers trusted Izzy, Izzy trusted his men, and they trusted that they'd be paid promptly.</p><p>Settling up the day that the work is performed is a biblical precept, and doing the ethical thing is always good business. Donald Trump was notorious for failing to pay subcontractors, and Antonio Brown's foibles, such as faking his vax card, were revealed by an unpaid chef. The Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson sex tape was released by a contractor he had stiffed. Karma.</p><p>Perks also help. I haven't gone after Google or Meta yet, but is it a coincidence that they have omelet stations and bok choy sides for their workers years after I brought mine donuts, bagels and pizza? Angel and his crew are a reliable order for six Subway cheesesteaks. More than a few times, late-staying workers have joined our family for my wife's exquisite cooking.</p><p>I don't like to brag, but in the past several months (and according to the mandatory timing of system failures) I've had malfunctioning smoke detectors fixed on Sunday afternoon, a sewer line hydro-jetted the day before Thanksgiving, and our dented Forester picked up the day after Christmas and returned two days later -- after which I was given the price for the repairs. My family and the tradesmen joked with each other and shared chocolate bars. Many of us may never swing a hammer or rewire a circuit, but we can all develop those nonmechanical skills that will hold us in good stead.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Weiss is a carpet salesman in Pittsburgh.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
