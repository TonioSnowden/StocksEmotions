  "text": "<p>The gradual change largely reflected short sellers trimming exposure to Tesla, rather than big changes in actively shorting of Apple, S3 Partners' managing director of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky wrote in a research note.</p><p>\"While short interest shows us dollars at risk, it does not show us the short trading activity that directly affects a stock's price,\" he explained.</p><p>That means Apple's recent gains are also affecting the total bet against it. The stock has gained 17% in the past three months, and outperformed the major indexes on the year.</p><p>\"Increases or decreases in short interest are a function of an increase or decrease in shares shorted and the change in a stock's price,\" he said. \"Therefore, if shares shorted stay static but a stock's price increases, its short interest increases â€” but with no short-side trading in the stock, short selling or short covering, the change in short interest has no effect on the rise or fall of the underlying stock's market price.\"</p><p>Read: iPhone 14 reviews say to go Pro, unless you're replacing an older phone and looking to save</p><p>Tesla's stock has also been hot in the past three months, rising 37%, and there has been some short covering in Tesla over the past 30 days, Dusaniwsky said. He added that he's seen increases in the number of Apple shares shorted over the same period.</p><p>When zooming out further, to the start of 2020, both names have seen net short covering.</p><p>See also: Apple still shows a flash of innovation despite lack of surprising iPhone 14 features</p><p>Don't miss: What iPhone 14 wait times say about Apple's early demand</p><p>Dusaniwsky wrote that while short interest as a percentage of the float is another figure that investors look at when analyzing short activity, it \"should only be used for stocks with similar market caps and float shares,\" and an Apple-Tesla comparison doesn't fit that bill. Apple has a $2.47 billion market value, while Tesla's stands at $915 million.</p><p>Tesla spent 864 days as Wall Street's biggest short bet. Now it's Apple.</p>",
