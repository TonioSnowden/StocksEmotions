  "text": "<p>   Covid-19 is roiling camps this summer, straining already-thin staffs and sometimes forcing cancellations. </p><p>   Nearly all camps across the country are dealing with rising cases in some way this summer as the highly transmissible BA.5 Omicron subvariant circulates, camp directors and industry groups say. For many, the issue is staffing. When counselors get sick, directors have to rework staff assignments and some activities get cut. </p><p>   \"A lot of camps were on the razor edge in the first place, so it's especially devastating when five people get Covid if you're just barely staffed,\" says Sarah Kurtz McKinnon, a former camp director and co-founder of industry group the Summer Camp Society. </p><p>   In some cases, camp directors have made the decision to cancel sessions. When this happens, it is especially difficult for parents who are then grappling with child-care scrambles, disrupted vacations and an unwelcome reminder that Covid continues to complicate daily life. </p><p>   Jennifer Orchard had been looking forward to her children's scheduled two weeks this month at camp on Lake Erie in Ohio. She and her husband had planned their first couples vacation in 16 years -- the age of their oldest child -- to Montreal with the hopes of a stress-free respite. </p><p>   The couple were on their way to a wine bar in the city when Ms. Orchard received an email with the subject line containing the words: \"PLEASE READ IMMEDIATELY.\" </p><p>   Due to rising Covid-19 cases, it read, the camp would be canceled halfway through the session. Caregivers would have to pick up their kids in the next day or within a one-hour window the following day. </p><p>   \"I'm thinking, 'Now what do we do?' \" Ms. Orchard recalls. They were more than 500 miles from camp, and had booked nonrefundable flights, hotels and a rental car. Ms. Orchard had to call their dogsitter, who offered to pick the kids up so the couple could finish out their trip. </p><p>   Several camp directors say between a quarter and a third of their staff, including counselors, kitchen workers and leadership, have tested positive during June and July. To some, this came as a relative surprise, because many camps emerged from summer 2021 having had zero or very few cases of the virus. </p><p>   Camp Luther in Conneaut, Ohio, got through last summer without any Covid cases, says the camp's executive director, Penny Christensen. This summer, they had to end a one-week session early and canceled the following session after 10 out of its 19 staff members tested positive. </p><p>   Cancellations can throw parents right back to the earlier days of the pandemic, juggling work and child care at home. </p><p>   After Troy Oppie's children's local day camp in Boise, Idaho, closed temporarily in early July, he found it harder to concentrate on work while his 8-year-old and 6-year-old daughters burned off their energy at home instead. He and his wife took pauses from work to make sure their younger daughter wasn't watching anything \"weird\" on the iPad, he says. </p><p>   Mr. Oppie, who hosts a dailyradio news show in the afternoon, usually spends the morning working from home -- a challenge amid the loud squeaks of his daughters bouncing on their trampoline alongside a riled-up, barking dog. </p><p>   \"The kids are kids, and they don't keep their voices in the yard,\" he says. </p><p>   Most camp leaders have managed to avoid shutdowns, but often only through formidable effort -- and sometimes even that doesn't work. Mike O'Brien, director of Camp AJ in McKee, Ky., says he worked 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. shifts to keep the camp running while a third of his staff was sick with Covid, including his assistant director. They still had to cancel a one-week session, he says. </p><p>   Some camps that have tried to keep tighter Covid precautions have run into pushback from parents. </p><p>   KBIA, a day camp in Kennebunk, Maine, initially planned to quarantine unvaccinated close contacts of campers and staff members who tested positive, says Mimi Fox, executive director. Many parents objected, she says, arguing that the guidance was too strict. Those complaints, combined with the manpower required to contact trace, led Ms. Fox to switch the camp to a test-to-stay approach, which involved screening staff and campers regularly after exposure rather than quarantining them. </p><p>   Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp in Twin Lake, Mich., canceled a two-week overnight session -- the first of the summer -- the day before it was slated to begin on June 22. A number of counselors tested positive during training, leaving the camp without enough staffing for the number of campers that were set to arrive. </p><p>   \"It was simple math,\" says Heidi Stansell, the camp's interim president. \"As difficult a decision as it was, we knew it was in the best interest of the health and safety of our camp community.\" </p><p>   Julie Resh-Jelliff's 16-year-old son, Bennett, was signed up for that first session. Ms. Resh-Jelliff had already booked time off from work to drive him to camp and had to reschedule it. </p><p>   She worried that her son would lose out on precious socializing time with his camp friends. It was one more thing that he would miss, she says, along with his eighth-grade honors' concert and his remote freshman year of high school. Bennett was able to get into a later camp session, says Ms. Resh-Jelliff, but some of his friends had already made other summer plans. </p><p>   \"As a parent, I feel like, when will Covid stop messing with my kids' lives?\" she says. \"He doesn't have much longer to have a normal childhood.\" </p><p></p>",
