  "text": "<p>Royal Mail has appointed former Ocado executive Simon Thompson as its new UK chief as the postal group aims to expand its parcels business in the wake of the ecommerce surge.</p> <p>“We need to develop a razor-sharp focus on the customer, making sure our services are delivering exactly what our customers need and want,” said Mr Thompson, who replaces interim UK boss Stuart Simpson with immediate effect.</p> <p>Parcel revenues surpassed those of letters for the first time in the group's history last year, helped by the online boom in response to the pandemic. </p> <p>The company said parcel revenue represented 60 per cent of total revenue in its half-year results in November. This compared with 47 per cent in the previous period. </p> <p>Keith Williams, who will revert from an executive chair to a non-executive chair position, said Royal Mail was in a period of “significant transition”.</p> <p>He added that Mr Thompson was “ideally placed to lead the opportunity to grow and expand our UK parcels business and to meet our customers' needs across both letters and parcels”.</p> <p>Mr Thompson was most recently chief product officer at Ocado and has held positions at Apple, Wm Morrison Supermarkets and HSBC. </p> <p>“I look forward to working with our colleagues and stakeholders to take this great company forward,” he said.</p> <p>Martin Seidenberg, chief executive of logistics group GLS, will join Royal Mail's board from April, while Mick Jeavons, interim chief financial officer since May, will take on that post permanently and will join the board. </p> <p>Mr Simpson, set to leave Royal Mail at the end of January following a brief handover period, took over as interim chief executive in May following the abrupt resignation of Rico Back, who had held the position for two years.</p> <p>Mr Back had struggled to modernise the 500-year old company and presided over a deterioration in relations with the unions.</p> <p>Royal Mail last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7380a80-eefe-42a5-a1ea-eef08b3913a0\">agreed a landmark deal</a> to improve pay and working conditions for its postal workers, ending a two-year dispute with the Communication Workers Union and enabling it to overhaul its business.</p> <p>The CWU said: “We welcome the appointment of the new CEO and look forward to working with him to protect and enhance our members' jobs and the role they play in every community in the UK.”</p> <p>Revenue was projected to be&#xa0;£380m&#xa0;to&#xa0;£580m&#xa0;higher year on year as a result of the growth in parcel volumes, Royal Mail has said.</p> <p>The company also said in December that a review of its operational network, set to conclude in April, would “support and build on proposals for the parcel network” and could lead to the introduction of dedicated van delivery duties for parcels. </p> <p>Shares were steady at 356.9p following Monday's announcement.</p> <p><em>This article has been altered to clarify that Simon Thompson is replacing Stuart Simpson</em></p><p>Source: George Steer 2021 'Royal Mail names new UK chief as it aims to expand parcels business ' FT.com 11 January.
