That data, along with The Wall Street Journal article, were the reasons for the stock market's continued rally \"as investors become more optimistic that the Fed will back off from its ultra-hawkish policies,\" he said via phone. \"Our thesis is that the Fed is going to have to back off\" or risk causing a global recession, Hatfield said.
