  "title": "Justice Department Prosecutors Swamped With Data as Cases Leave Long Digital Trails; The flood of electronic evidence has slowed court proceedings and risks reducing the number of cases charged",
  "text": "<p>\"Why so long?\" asked U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein.</p><p>\"It's a substantial amount of information, your Honor,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said, adding that prosecutors had to sort through their evidence, \"which itself takes quite a bit of time.\"</p><p>Federal prosecutors are swamped by data, as the way people communicate and engage in behavior scrutinized by investigators often leaves long and complicated digital trails that can outpace the Justice Department's technology.</p><p>The problem is acute within the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, which, because of its jurisdiction over Wall Street, brings some of the most complex white-collar crime cases in the country. Damian Williams, who took over the office last year and pledged to aggressively prosecute corruption in financial markets, views the data issue as a crisis and has raised it with the Justice Department's top brass, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The Manhattan office has already implemented some new data-management strategies, including, under Mr. Williams, rolling out a new electronic-evidence unit whose staff includes a lawyer specializing in document review. The office has also recently begun using a new tracking system for evidence.</p><p>Prosecutors have discussed that, unless the office can better manage data-related issues, they may need to consider charging fewer cases, the people said.</p><p>\"Practically speaking, the single biggest constraint on effective white-collar prosecution is the deficiencies in DOJ data infrastructure,\" said Ilan Graff, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP. \"If you are investigating a target and get terabytes of data—internal communications, Bloomberg chats, preserved messaging—the time it takes to get it uploaded and the search-related delays can be paralyzing.\"</p><p>The problem extends well beyond New York. In the investigation into the 2017 Las Vegas shooting that left dozens dead at a country music festival, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it recovered one petabyte of data. (For comparison, the Library of Congress says it manages 21 petabytes of digital content.) In the Justice Department's investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Attorney General Merrick Garland said prosecutors had issued more than 5,000 subpoenas and search warrants, examined more than 20,000 hours of video footage, and searched through 15 terabytes of data. One petabyte is the equivalent of 1,000 terabytes, or 1 million gigabytes. For comparison, two gigabytes can fit on a small thumb drive.</p><p>The extent of the evidence that prosecutors had to provide to some of the defendants has slowed court proceedings.</p><p>Federal prosecutors for several years have come to see the flood of electronic evidence as a growing challenge for the Justice Department.</p><p>\"I was starting to see cases fall apart or not even be brought because of this problem,\" said Gregg Sofer, who served as counselor to Attorney General William Barr and as former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas.</p><p>Mr. Barr had him and the deputy attorney general's office draft an order, which was later issued in the summer of 2020, outlining the need for transformative changes in federal law-enforcement's data practices.</p><p>In addition to managing evidence to build their cases, prosecutors during pretrial discovery have an obligation to turn over everything in their possession that could be favorable to the defendant, in a timely fashion. If they don't, they can face sanctions and the dismissal of their cases.</p><p>Defense attorneys have learned to exploit prosecutors overwhelmed by documents. \"It's given them a new avenue,\" said Rachel Maimin, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Lowenstein Sandler LLP. \"It naturally increases the chance something might inadvertently slip through.\"</p><p>The data flood comes into play in routine cases as well.</p><p>In a 2018 case, Manhattan federal prosecutors handling a robbery and gun-possession case told a judge their evidence included video footage from surveillance cameras, New York Police Department reports and two cellphones. One of the phones, an iPhone, produced about 28,000 pages of evidence.</p><p>Brian Blais, who supervised the General Crimes unit from 2017 through 2020, said he routinely told prosecutors to consider whether additional evidence, such as phones or social-media accounts, were necessary in routine gun-possession cases. \"It was always a question of thinking about how it helps your case versus the later burden and potential for tripping up on discovery violations,\" said Mr. Blais, now a partner at law firm Ropes &amp; Gray LLP.</p><p>Overwhelming quantities of data have contributed to a series of judicial rebukes over prosecutors' handling of discovery and evidence collection.</p><p>In one prominent case, after an Iranian businessman was convicted at a 2020 trial for a scheme to violate sanctions laws, prosecutors moved to dismiss the case. The presiding judge said prosecutors didn't properly disclose evidence to the defense and made a misrepresentation to the court.</p><p>The judge said prosecutors had failed to live up to their ideals. Prosecutors said in a letter that the office was responsible for substantial failures in the case, but that government lawyers hadn't intentionally withheld exculpatory evidence.</p><p>The Justice Department has been working on ways to address the problem, including by seeking additional funding for electronic-evidence technology and staffing for U.S. attorney's offices. It is also providing guidance in an annual training for prosecutors to at times collect less data.</p><p>A department spokesman said the department is focused on technology and training, including strategies for targeted and efficient collection of electronic evidence based on the particularized needs of each case.</p><p>Former prosecutors said the strategy of collecting less evidence has limitations because in some cases investigators might overlook critical or exculpatory records.</p><p>\"If the prosecutors and investigators are afraid to look for evidence,\" said Mr. Sofer, the former Justice Department official, \"they're going to miss things.\"</p><p>Aruna Viswanatha and Sadie Gurman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to James Fanelli at james.fanelli@wsj.com and Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com</p><p>Justice Department Prosecutors Swamped With Data as Cases Leave Long Digital Trails</p>",
