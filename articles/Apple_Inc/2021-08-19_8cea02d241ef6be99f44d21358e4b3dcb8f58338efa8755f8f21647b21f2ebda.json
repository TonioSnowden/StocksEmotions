  "title": "The Laugh Track Is Back in Fashion; After 75 years, adding laughter to TV programs has gone from cutting-edge technology to nostalgic reminder of sitcoms past.",
  "text": "<p>During the early months of the pandemic last year, late night TV talk shows had to broadcast without a live audience. Producers didn't want to replace audience response with a laugh track, to avoid appearing corny, dated or gimmicky. But jokes delivered from a host's silent den often seemed a lot less funny to at-home viewers. It was hard to discern whether the host was being comedic or serious without the sound of laughter.</p><p>Research has found that the sound of group laughter is critical to humor's impact. According to a 2019 study led by Sophie Scott, director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, laughter makes jokes seem funnier, probably because it's contagious. \"The laugh track was introduced initially to take the place of a studio audience and let TV viewers know what was funny,\" Prof. Scott says. \"Laughter is a form of social bonding. People are 30 times more likely to laugh if there are others with them. They want to be part of the collective experience.\"</p><p>In recent decades, the laugh track has become unfashionable, while incidental music remains essential to TV and film. But the two aren't as different as they might seem. \"Background music is there to build anxiety and fear. The laugh track performs the same role for humor, to trigger an emotional response,\" says Robert Thompson, professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Does your favorite sitcom use a laugh track? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In the U.S., recorded laughter began in 1920 with the release of \"The Okeh Laughing Record.\" Originally recorded in Germany, the album featured a sad cornet interrupted by a woman and a man laughing. The odd novelty 78 sold more than a million copies. As a juicer for live entertainment, however, canned laughter made its first appearance in 1946. To raise the spirits of American troops stationed overseas, sound engineers for Armed Forces Radio doctored comedies with the recorded sound of audience laughter.</p><p>That same year, Jack Mullin, an electronics specialist in the Army Signal Corps, returned from the war with two radio-quality German magnetic tape recorders that could reproduce sound as if it were live. Mullin demonstrated a modified unit in May 1946, and his presentation caught the ear of Frank Healey, who worked on Bing Crosby's popular radio show. The crooner wanted to record his program in the relaxed environment of a studio, but it had to sound live; the new tape technology made that possible.</p><p>Crosby's first taped show was broadcast on Oct. 1, 1947. During one recording session, the live audience laughed too long at a joke, pushing the program over its running time. After the laughter was shortened, Crosby asked the engineer to save the strip of spliced tape in case it was needed later. Before long, they had 42 tapes of different types of audience laughter. These allowed Crosby to record his show at home in Nevada with no audience, interspersing it with outbursts and groans of just the right length.</p><p>As television caught on in the early 1950s, most comedies were filmed in front of a live audience. Taped laughter was used for shows that didn't have audience space or much of a budget. \"The Hank McCune Show,\" a sketch comedy program, is widely considered to be the first sitcom to use canned laughter, in 1950. Others quickly followed, as more sitcoms were created and recorded laughter was used to supplement weak audience responses.</p><p>When videotape began to replace live cameras at the end of the decade, TV shows could be edited before airing. But splicing left audio gaps that needed smoothing out. Producers called in Charles Douglass, a sound engineer who had invented a mysterious and complex \"laff box\" in 1953. It featured a keyboard that could combine a wide selection of taped audience responses, holding 320 different laughs on 32 tape loops.</p><p>Douglass's work picked up considerably in the 1960s, when sitcoms began dropping live audiences. Shows like \"Leave It to Beaver,\" \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and \"The Addams Family\" were taped in multiple locations per episode, including outdoors, so adding taped laughter made more sense.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, shows such as \"All in the Family\" and \"Cheers\" brought back live audiences for greater authenticity, but the laugh track remained common. In the 1990s, \"Friends\" used a live audience while \"Seinfeld\" went with a laugh track. Not until the 2000s did hit sitcoms such as \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"The Office\" start to dispense with both, relying on characters' laughter and facial expressions to cue at-home responses.</p><p>Today, the laugh track has evolved. On the new AMC series \"Kevin Can F**k Himself,\" when Allison McRoberts, played by Annie Murphy, is with her husband Kevin, the show is a sitcom with a laugh track; when she's alone, it's a dark, emotional drama, and the laughs disappear. On the sci-fi comedy miniseries \"WandaVision\" on Disney+, the laugh track appears when the show puts its characters into the settings of sitcoms past.</p><p>Which brings us to \"The Daily Show.\" When the Covid-19 pandemic began sending Americans home in March 2020, the taped Comedy Central show shifted from the studio to the New York apartment of host Trevor Noah. At first, a single iPhone on a tripod was used to feed video to the editors working remotely; a second was added later.</p><p>\"We had to come up with a new set of pandemic rules,\" said \"Daily Show\" executive producer and showrunner Jennifer Flanz. \"Edits had to indicate the places where a studio audience would have laughed.\" The show would use a hard cut away from Mr. Noah as a joke ended or would punch in when he did an impression. Sometimes the host would be two different characters and have a conversation with himself. Facial expressions also were key.</p><p>If late-night hosts are forced to broadcast from home again later this year, would the laugh track be more palatable to audiences? \"Probably,\" Ms. Flanz said. \"But it couldn't be abstractly addedâ€”it would have to become a character and be acknowledged by the host, like a doorbell or any audio prop. The laugh track is still tricky.\"</p><p>Mr. Myers is a regular contributor to The Wall Street Journal and the author of \"Rock Concert: An Oral History as Told by the Artists, Backstage Insiders and Fans Who Were There,\" which will be published by Grove Press on Nov. 9.</p><p>The Laugh Track Is Back in Fashion</p>",
