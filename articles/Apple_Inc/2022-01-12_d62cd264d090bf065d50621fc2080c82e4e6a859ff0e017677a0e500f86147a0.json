  "text": "<p>His game, Wordle!, was being mistaken for another word game that recently became a world-wide phenomenon: Wordle, without the exclamation point.</p><p>\"I didn't know it was a craze,\" Mr. Cravotta, now 24 years old, said in an interview. \"I had no idea what was going on.\"</p><p>The other Wordle has no app and can be played only once a day on a website. But those searching for Wordle in the App Store landed on Mr. Cravotta's game.</p><p>At one point on Tuesday, five of the top 20 word games downloaded on Apple's store had the word \"Wordle\" in their title, including Wordle! by Mr. Cravotta.</p><p>Some users realized they weren't getting the Wordle they expected. Mr. Cravotta said his game has gotten a bunch of bad reviews. \"People are just confused,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Cravotta, who works for an ad agency and lives in Santa Monica, Calif., makes apps on the side. His game is different from the more famous Wordle. In Wordle!, players have around 12 seconds to spell a word with four scrambled letters. The game is free, but for longer words, there is a 99-cent charge.</p><p>Wordle, on the other hand, is a guessing game that gives a person six chances to guess the day's secret five-letter word. Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are or aren't in the word. The game is free and has no ads.</p><p>The creator of Wordle, software engineer Josh Wardle, said in an interview Saturday with The Wall Street Journal that he has been approached about turning the game into an app but currently has no plans to do so. He said Wordle doesn't currently make money. </p><p>The more famous Wordle game can be played only on a website.

Jimmy Fallon, the host of \"The Tonight Show,\" has tweeted about Wordle to his 51.4 million followers three times in the past week.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Are you playing Wordle? Why do you think it is so addictive? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Some have tried to cash in on Wordle's fame by rushing out copycat apps that look like it. While many topped Apple's App Store charts, Apple said Tuesday night that it had removed fake Wordle apps from its store without specifying how many.</p><p>One such app, What Word-Wordle, which launched last week, had 20,000 downloads between Jan. 1 and Jan. 7, according to App Annie, a mobile-app analytics firm. Efforts to reach that app's developer were unsuccessful. By Tuesday night, it was no longer in the App Store.</p><p>Mr. Cravotta said the recent attention to Wordle!—which moved up four spots in the App Store on Tuesday night after the others were deleted—had brought in $1,000 from ads and in-app purchases. He said he plans to donate the money to charity.</p><p>He hasn't promoted or updated Wordle! in years. Instead, he has been focusing on an app that aims to help people quit vaping, called Puff Count.</p><p>Mr. Cravotta said he might make tweaks to Wordle! based on the comments and suggestions he received. He doesn't care that the more well-known Wordle uses the same name.</p><p>\"It's just a crazy circumstance and just a lucky place to be,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>Wordle Fans Are Mistakenly Downloading an App Created by a Teenager Five Years Ago</p>",
