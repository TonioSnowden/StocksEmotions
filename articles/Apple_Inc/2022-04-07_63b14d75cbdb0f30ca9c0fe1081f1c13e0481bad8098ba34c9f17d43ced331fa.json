  "text": "<p>Meta's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a88fb591-72d5-4b6b-bb5d-223adfb893f3\"> misadventure with its diem</a> cryptocurrency has led to a big rethink by Facebook's parent on how it might still cash in on payments.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50fbe9ba-32c8-4caf-a34e-234031019371\">Hannah Murphy's exclusive report</a> reveals one option being explored by its financial arm, Meta Financial Technologies, is a virtual currency for the metaverse, dubbed “Zuck Bucks” by employees internally.</p> <p>Given its failure to win over regulators with its grand plans for diem, the new Zuck Buck is unlikely to be a cryptocurrency based on the blockchain. Instead, Meta is leaning towards introducing in-app tokens that would be centrally controlled by the company, similar to those used in gaming apps, such as the robux currency in popular children's game Roblox.</p> <p>Hannah's information is that Meta is also looking into the creation of “social tokens” or “reputation tokens”, which could be issued as rewards for meaningful contributions in Facebook groups, for example. Another effort is to make “creator coins” that might be associated with particular influencers on its photo-sharing app Instagram.</p> <p>More prosaically, Meta has also been exploring traditional financial services, with a focus on helping to provide small business loans at attractive rates.</p> <p>In terms of other digital assets, we already knew that Instagram would start to support non-fungible tokens — NFTs — but an internal memo last week said Meta plans to launch a pilot for posting and sharing NFTs on Facebook in mid-May.</p> <p>While these moves are far more modest in their ambition than diem, they are much less likely to attract the opprobrium of regulators and politicians. Cumulatively, they could increase user engagement and provide a significant increase in the real-world bucks recorded on Meta's earnings releases.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1.
