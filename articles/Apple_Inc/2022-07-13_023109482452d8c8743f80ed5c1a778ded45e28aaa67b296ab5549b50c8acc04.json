  "title": "Peloton Backpedals in Right Direction --- Fitness company says it will outsource its manufacturing as it steers toward more sustainable growth",
  "text": "<p>Peloton said Tuesday that it will stop producing its own hardware, exiting all owned manufacturing operations and expanding its relationship with its Taiwanese manufacturer, Rexon Industrial Corp. The move comes as Peloton's new Chief Executive Barry McCarthy works to right the company's financials, unwinding big, and in hindsight naive, bets co-founder John Foley made.</p><p>Peloton's shares, which lost 92% of their value over the past year, rose by almost 4%% on Tuesday. A shift to outsourced manufacturing came as a relief. The about-face highlights what Mr. Foley got spectacularly wrong: Peloton acquired Taiwan manufacturer Tonic Fitness Technology in 2019 -- a move Mr. Foley said was meant to help Peloton own the supply chain to increase scale and capacity, as well as to \"delight\" its members.</p><p>But, as online retailer Stitch Fix, another business undergoing major restructuring and suffering a similar stock-price implosion also is learning, it is very hard to own every piece of your customers' experience and grow exponentially without losing your investors. The numbers simply don't add up.</p><p>Customers probably won't care where their exercise bike is made, and in fact Rexon and other contract manufacturers had been building some of Peloton's components and equipment. Apple, a company with a reputation for design and a loyal customer base, outsources its manufacturing, largely to China. That wasn't always the case, but outsourcing went a long way toward making the company highly profitable, courtesy of current Chief Executive Tim Cook. In Peloton's case, it is worth noting that Rexon builds the company's Tread treadmill and built its recalled Tread+, the sales of which are on hold. As long as there are no more recalls, Peloton users are there for the company's content, with the pretty hardware just a means to the end.</p><p>Mr. Foley wanted Wall Street to see Peloton as a growth company, and that is how it was valued at its peak. Ultimately, there are going to be only so many people interested in sweating profusely on an expensive stationary bike alongside kindred endorphin seekers the world over. As BMO analyst Simeon Siegel put it, Peloton is a company with a phenomenal stable of existing users and right now, it should be focused on \"bear hugging\" those loyalists.</p><p>Data from UBS show that adoption levels of Peloton's cheaper app, which the company views as a key customer-acquisition tool toward its more expensive subscription, continued to decline in May and early June. It also showed active users declining since January. YipitData shows subscriber retention for fiscal 2022 slightly underperformed historical averages and that churn increased in June year over year. More broadly, Similarweb data shows \"home fitness\" web traffic declining 24% year over year for the most recently tracked two-week period in late June -- the largest annual declines logged by the firm this year.</p><p>Wall Street will have to wait for Peloton's fiscal fourth-quarter report for more granular details on how exactly Tuesday's announcement will affect the company's cost structure. A Peloton representative confirmed the company would cut about 570 employees in Taiwan, but that 100 employees would remain in that business unit focused on quality control, engineering and research and development. And Peloton will get a new chief financial officer in Liz Coddington -- previously of Amazon.com and Netflix -- after the company said Jill Woodworth, who served in that role since 2018, will step down.</p><p>The company we once knew as aspirational is quickly becoming a commodity. It will try to prove to its investors that it can at least be a hot one.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
