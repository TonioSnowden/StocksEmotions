Here's the rest of the day's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. CIA director says China ‘unsettled' by Ukraine war</strong> Bill Burns said the “bitter experience” of the first two months of the war in Ukraine had come as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4e8de3b-a2aa-4f10-a820-a910274175a8\">a surprise to the Chinese leadership</a> and could be affecting its calculations with respect to Taiwan. Burns added that Xi's China was the “biggest geopolitical challenge we face over the long term as a country”, even though the threat from Putin's Russia could not be underestimated. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/f9946275-55eb-4e02-a8eb-3a0e8379784a?playlist-name=editors-picks&amp;playlist-offset=0\">Watch the full interview</a>. </p> <p><strong>2.

Defence companies face supply chain snags </strong>US defence contractors are preparing to increase production to meet extra demand from US and European governments following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But supply chain issues, labour constraints and inflationary pressures could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/230f39ed-9403-4de1-93c8-56c2162e217d\">hold back efforts</a> to scale up production, they have warned. </p> <p><strong>4. Spyware company NSO dodges questions</strong> NSO Group has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3323ae3a-6ace-43f2-a6e5-c0ee9b65b6b9\">stonewalled questions</a> about whether it is operating legally, according to the US consultancy acting on behalf of the private equity fund that owns 70 per cent of the Israeli spyware company. </p> <p><strong>5.

Equity funds were particularly badly hit, with inflows slowing to a trickle of just $2.8bn, compared with $76.2bn a month earlier.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Outlook for markets</strong> Futures contracts tracking Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 index fell 1.5 per cent, while those tracking the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.7 per cent after shares in Asia and Europe began <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6691700c-9dfd-4911-8589-70b4ebd2caef\">the new week in the red</a>.

The company has faced transport and logistical problems linked to Covid-19 lockdowns in China and warned of rising prices. Analytics software company Palantir and retail investor favourite AMC Entertainment also report.</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> The Atlanta Branch of the Federal Reserve holds its signature policy and research event this week — the Financial Markets Conference. The conference, held in Florida, kicked off on Sunday and runs to Wednesday. Policy sessions today will discuss green returns and which central bank digital currency, if any, is right for the US. Separately, the Fed releases its twice yearly financial stability report at 4pm New York time.</p> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> Consumer prices in Mexico are forecast to have moderated to 0.58 per cent month on month in April, according to a Refinitiv survey of economists, from an increase of 1 per cent in March. Core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, is forecast to have accelerated slightly to 0.75 per cent from the previous month.</p> <p><strong>Philippines election</strong> Filipinos have begun voting in a national election that pits the son and namesake of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22a201b7-b0d5-49c3-8bb5-0dc848f0fead\">late dictator Ferdinand Marcos</a> and his running mate Sara Duterte, daughter of incumbent Rodrigo Duterte, against a progressive candidate promising a break with the country's increasingly authoritarian governance.</p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland talks</strong> The UK government will begin talks to try and coax pro-British unionists to join the region's government after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53592270-98aa-4030-812a-dc019461b8d7\">a historic victory</a> for the nationalist Sinn Féin party in last week's regional elections.</p> <p><strong>Pulitzer Prize</strong> The 106th annual Pulitzer Prize winners and finalists will be announced, with awards in journalism, drama, letters and music.</p> <p><a href=\"https://car.live.ft.com/home\"><em>FT's Future of the Car summit</em></a><em>, which runs from today until Thursday, features Tesla founder Elon Musk, who will be speaking and taking questions, along with a host of other industry leaders. </em><a href=\"http://ft.com/carsummit\"><em>Register here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>What else we're reading </h1> <p><strong>Money managers in demand </strong>The industry for outsourcing investment mandates is booming as challenging markets, compliance regulations and rising costs push big asset owners to seek help. The sector has more than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3479c8dc-30fc-4d8b-90cd-1ef4f758c30b\">doubled in size since 2016 </a>to $2.46tn in global assets under management.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>More on investment:</strong> The concept of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75f3ed84-62ae-4cb4-947f-bd7e75591481\">acronym investing is coming apart</a>, Ruchir Sharma writes.

But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5a4435d-7ebf-4b00-a156-403a468bb964\">it was an unusual manoeuvre</a> by one of the buyout industry's least known success stories that made it possible.</p> <p><strong>Explaining Web3 to beginners </strong>Web3 — the new internet — is built with blockchain technology, which supports digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. However, its complexity has been a barrier to participation.

It is hardly new to tack a weekend of sightseeing on to a conference, but as business travel picks up and Covid-19 curbs end, there are reasons to believe this year its time has come.</p> <h1>How To Spend It</h1> <p>Jony Ive, the former chief designer at Apple who runs his own agency based in San Francisco, edited <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01ce4d84-d7bd-4bd0-b04a-bc009a4d37a5\">the latest edition</a> of How To Spend It.
