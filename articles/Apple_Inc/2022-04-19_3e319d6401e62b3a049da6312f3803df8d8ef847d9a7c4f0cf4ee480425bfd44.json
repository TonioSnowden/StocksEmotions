  "title": "Netflix Subscriber Growth Gets Most Attention Even as Revenue Expected to Jump; The streaming giant is seen posting lower per-share earnings amid a slowdown in new subscribers",
  "text": "<p>Netflix in January projected 2.5 million new subscribers for the first quarter. Wall Street's consensus expectations are in line with the company's projection, but some analysts believe the figure may be closer to three million. In the first quarter of 2021, the company added nearly four million new subscribers.</p><p>Analysts are expecting the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company to report quarterly earnings of $2.90 a share, down from $3.75 a share a year earlier. Revenue is expected to reach $7.93 billion, up from $7.16 billion.</p><p>Netflix's subscriber growth has been on a roller coaster for the past couple of years amid the Covid-19 pandemic, with numbers surging when people stayed home but weakening during periods of reopening. \"Covid has introduced so much noise,\" said Netflix Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings during the company's most recent earnings call in January.</p><p>The company is also contending with a growing suite of content from competitors such as Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s HBO Max and Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+.</p><p>Netflix said in January it expected to add a smaller number of subscribers in the first quarter than it had in previous years because most of its highest-profile content was to be released toward the end of the quarter, including the second season of \"Bridgerton\" and its film \"The Adam Project\" starring Ryan Reynolds.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What happened to your Netflix viewing over the past year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>While these two releases were touted by management, an unexpected hit has garnered significant attention as well. The Korean drama \"All of Us Are Dead\" has seen roughly as much engagement as \"Bridgerton\" in the first quarter despite being a brand new title with most of its popularity contained to the Asia-Pacific region, said Nathaniel Harmon, a senior research analyst at YipitData.</p><p>Greater competition and rising programming costs have prompted the company to enact changes in recent months. In January, Netflix raised the price for its monthly plans for the first time since 2020. In March, Netflix said that it is testing a new feature that will charge users who share their accounts with people outside of their households, beginning in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru before a wider rollout.</p><p>This contrasts with options presented by competitors. Disney announced last month that it would roll out a cheaper, ad-supported Disney+ subscription in the U.S. beginning in late 2022. The move would leave Netflix and Apple Inc. as the remaining major streaming services that don't offer a lower-cost, ad-supported option.</p><p>\"As more alternatives enter the market and continue to grow their streaming capabilities, Netflix's pricing power would arguably decrease if engagement remains flat,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note.</p><p>Write to Denny Jacob at denny.jacob@wsj.com and Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Subscriber Growth Gets Most Attention Even as Revenue Expected to Jump</p>",
