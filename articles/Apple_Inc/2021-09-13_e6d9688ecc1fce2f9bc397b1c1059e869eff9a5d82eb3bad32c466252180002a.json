  "text": "<p>Romi Topi spent 20 years building a successful shoeshine business among the hedge funds and high-end hotels of London's Mayfair.</p> <p>About half of Topi's clients were international business people coming to buff up their footwear before meetings. His stall in Burlington Arcade cleaned 45 pairs of shoes a day in the good times, taking sales of about £60,000 a year.</p> <p>But customers dried up overnight when the pandemic hit, and Topi has spent the past 18 months scrambling to save his business amid growing uncertainty over the future of corporate travel.</p> <p>“Hopefully, it will resume again this month. That's very optimistic, though,” he said.</p> <p>Topi's business is just one in an ecosystem that has been built up over decades to service the once-booming corporate travel industry. </p> <p>Businesses now fill every niche in a traveller's journey from the moment they step out of their house, from chauffeurs to airport lounges and restaurants to dry cleaners.</p> <p>These businesses face tough decisions with office workers slow to return from homeworking and executives predicting a permanent, or at least long-term, drop in corporate travel. Some have turned to new niches. Others have hunkered down, hoping to ride out the crisis. </p> <p>Data from Travelogix shows that in the first week of September, international business travel from the UK was 80 per cent lower than the same week in 2019. The Business Travel Association estimated the UK lost £4.47bn in gross domestic product in the first week of September because of the decline in corporate travel spending. </p> <p>The uptake of video conferencing during lockdowns prompted hotel group Accor's chief executive Sebastian Bazin to tell a hotel conference in Berlin last week that 20 to 25 per cent of international corporate travel could be lost, while Marriott's chief executive Tony Capuano told the Financial Times, “nobody knows” what the fallout would be.</p> <p>Many airline bosses have also predicted a long-term impact from the pandemic.</p> <p>But the ecosystem behind corporate travel spreads far beyond the “big box” hotel companies and business class airlines. Thousands of smaller businesses stand to suffer, if industry predictions about a longer-term drop in corporate travel are correct.</p> <p>“Hospitality is the taxi drivers, the restaurant owners, the airlines, the car rental,” said Dimitris Manikis, president of Europe, Middle East and Africa for Wyndham Hotels, who said that business travel was the sector that hoteliers are expecting to “rebound last”. </p> <p>Manikis, who before Covid-19 spent 220 days a year on the road, said he expected to do half that in future, particularly as concerns about climate change grew. </p> <p>Craig Chambers, the chief executive of TBR Global Chauffeuring, said Covid “wiped the business out nearly overnight”. </p> <p>A company with £40m in turnover in a normal year, TBR is now operating at about 25 per cent of normal levels and picking up business where it can, including from governments and sports events.</p> <p>Chambers feared that his network of self-employed drivers will no longer be in the industry when passengers return. </p> <p>Contractors that he worked with in the US, where government support was less forthcoming than in Europe, no longer exist, he said. “The industry has been so decimated, everyone has had to sell off assets.”</p> <p>Julian Stone, managing director of American Dry Cleaning, a 45-site chain spread across London, said the company has switched from cleaning suits to upholstery and invested in two curtain-stretching machines (curtains reduce by about 12 per cent in size when washed) to keep up with demand. </p> <p>The chain used to churn through 28,000 shirts and about 25,000 suit jackets and trousers each week, but now cleans less than half those numbers. </p> <p>Contract work from high-end hotels that made up 20 per cent of sales in 2019 also vanished because “the need for business travel has reduced dramatically”, Stone said.</p> <p>But promising signs are emerging: a recent growth in the number of suits and shirts coming in for mending suggests some appetite to get back on the road.</p> <p>“We are getting more mending work because the moths have been at prey when the suits are hung up for a while. They look like Swiss cheese, some of them,” Stone said.</p> <p>Like Stone, several in the travel ecosystem have readdressed their operations to find pockets of demand where they can.</p> <p>Global hotel companies such as InterContinental Hotel Group, which launched a luxury resort brand last month, and Hyatt Hotels, which bought the high-end resort operator Apple Leisure for $2.7bn, have swung towards the booming leisure market.</p> <p>Others have sourced sales from other sectors.</p> <p>Jo Layton, director at CAP Worldwide Serviced Apartments, said that smaller serviced apartment businesses in the UK “changed drastically” last year. </p> <p>Businesses switched from serving corporate customers to housing healthcare workers, short-term residential stays and homeless people who were put up by local councils during the first wave of the pandemic.</p> <p>“We have survived. We might not have been here today if we hadn't been able to do that,” said Robert Alley, chief operating officer at Roomzzz Aparthotels. </p> <p>“Some of what we have been doing will stay, and some of what we did before will come back,” he added.</p> <p>Back in Mayfair's shopping arcade, Topi fears the changes to the industry could be permanent. </p> <p>“In the past, maybe if [executives] signed a contract between companies, it would have taken 10 face-to-face meetings. Today it might be one — just the final agreement. The other eight or nine would be on Zoom.”</p><p>Source: Philip Georgiadis and Alice Hancock 2021 'Shoeshiners and chauffeurs hit by corporate travel uncertainty' FT.com 13 September.
