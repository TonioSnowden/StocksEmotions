  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>Weaker than expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb302ef4-001a-478f-ac61-31cdc972cc8e\">Chinese growth figures</a> have fuelled fears of a global recession as coronavirus lockdowns continue to plague the world's manufacturing powerhouse.</p> <p>The country's economy grew just 0.4 per cent in the three months to June, the second-worst quarterly figure in 30 years and far below forecasts of 1.2 per cent. It is also a steep drop from the 4.8 per cent recorded in the first quarter. China is now expected to miss its target of 5.5 per cent annual growth, itself a three-decade low.</p> <p>The quarter included a two-month lockdown in Shanghai that exposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9318db50-e0c3-4a27-9230-55ff59bcc46e\">global supply chains</a>, with multinationals from Apple to Tesla to&#xa0;Estée Lauder warning of disruption to their business from the city that handles 20 per cent of China's international trade.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10629271.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The effects of Beijing's zero-Covid policy have also been a recurring feature of the current company results season. </p> <p>British luxury goods company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3da5872-cb9f-4027-9b8e-ad7231bdd930\">Burberry</a> today said lockdowns were to blame for a 35 per cent fall in same-store sales, while Richemont, which sells watches and jewellery, said sales had fallen 37 per cent. Mining company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fb9056e-1231-41be-be3a-fc808042323e\">Rio Tinto</a> said they had caused demand to “trough” in its biggest market. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/684162a9-f58b-4f0a-a57d-831ed863f157\">Macau</a>, the world's biggest gambling hub, remains shut. Shares in its big operators, including MGM China, SJM Holdings and Wynn Macau are down 60 per cent in the past year, with operating margins turned negative since 2020. “On both counts, there are further declines ahead,” says the Lex column.</p> <p>There are also signs that as Chinese consumers emerge from lockdown they are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f8a06a4-fdfe-4060-833e-66ee138c5d08\">re-evaluating their spending</a>, especially when it comes to luxury goods.</p> <p>The weak GDP reading also helped push down the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63c35adc-ef87-44d9-a349-e8521715ee27\">price of copper</a>, widely regarded as a measure of economic activity because of its widespread manufacturing use, as recession fears hit commodities markets.</p> <p>The Chinese property sector remains a drag on growth. Regulators are currently trying to damp down panic over the cost of loans as homeowners join a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fab4b10-5e8e-4c94-8d19-d62f56044a91\">mortgage boycott</a> of unfinished houses. Developers in some parts of the country have even begun accepting garlic, watermelons, wheat and barley as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2eef1d78-3c38-4065-b6dc-a8ba061d3483\">down payments from farmers</a> on new apartments. </p> <p>Today's figures have fuelled expectations that Beijing could be preparing a huge new stimulus programme to revive growth.<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e775f1e6-010d-4089-9c03-69ff86e385ac\"> Local governments</a> will be allowed to issue an additional Rmb1.5tn ($223bn) worth of bonds this year, brought forward from next year's quota.</p> <p>Coronavirus infections meanwhile continue to rise, particularly from the BA.4 and BA.5 variants, with 11 Chinese cities under <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cc5e1d5-7665-4379-a344-7e9a9aaceaae\">full or partial lockdowns</a>, affecting almost 115mn people, according to Japanese bank Nomura. </p> <p>Hong Kong, where even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/181b1876-ddf0-4f1c-b2a8-40116bbcb9d3\">feng shui masters</a> have been thrown off balance by Covid restrictions, yesterday reported more than 3,600 new cases, while Shanghai residents fear another mass lockdown could be on the way.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbb27900-3c44-4bc1-969d-fad5616a0371#post-158c23e9-6075-4973-baea-bae4f416c368\">US retail sales</a> rise by a more-than-expected 1 per cent in June</p></li>  <li><p>European Commission proposes ban on imports of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbb27900-3c44-4bc1-969d-fad5616a0371#post-39073278-e916-4de6-a6b0-4e6357202efa\">Russian gold</a></p></li>  <li><p>Brussels backs ‘crucial' €5.4bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15887475-c72c-45a3-a33b-052f3fa949b7\">hydrogen plant</a> </p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbb27900-3c44-4bc1-969d-fad5616a0371\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Investors are demanding a higher premium to hold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f01e3706-515c-4cb9-91e6-d53739767926\">Italian debt</a> after political tensions led prime minister <strong>Mario Draghi </strong>to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/957d48dd-7839-4332-a823-da3f7172a547\"> offer to stand down</a> as his national unity coalition began to splinter.

The <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> is under pressure to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fabe5b47-afea-4557-adac-ce4ddeb4c206\">abandon its guidance</a> on monetary policy. One of its top officials left the door open for a possible <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2c237db-c56d-4530-81d5-856c6477dc13\">full percentage point rise</a> in interest rates at the end of the month.</p> <p><strong>Sri Lankan president</strong> Gotabaya Rajapaksa <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e07cd47b-401d-439f-a750-a7a35bc357bc\">resigned</a> after a week of protests over shortages and soaring inflation.
