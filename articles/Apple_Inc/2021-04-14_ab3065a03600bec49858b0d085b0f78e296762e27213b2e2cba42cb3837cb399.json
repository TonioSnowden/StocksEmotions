  "text": "<p>Tucked into a wooded valley on the edge of Dartmoor, Gidleigh Park belongs among that exclusive group of deep-rural destinations whose directions warn: “Do not rely on your satnav”. Instead, you turn off an (already very narrow) country road just outside Chagford, then follow a dead-end lane for a mile and a half, fearing for your wing mirrors as you burrow between high hedgerows and ancient, moss-covered stone walls. The lane twists, rises and falls as it traces the young River Teign, suddenly plunging into the shade of old oaks. “Keep heart you are still en route” says a sign in the tangled branches with half a mile to go.</p> <p>And then, after one final bend, you pop out into a genteel world of manicured lawns, tennis courts, formal gardens, sculptures and the imposing half-timbered façade of a Tudor-style mansion. Ordinarily the arrival moment here would be augmented by uniformed staff, the bustle of smart guests on the long terrace, a tinkle of glasses, perhaps laughter drifting over from a game of croquet. Except on Monday this week, it was different: the five-star hotel and its 107 acres of grounds had just four guests — my family and me.</p> <p>This was the day of England's “big unlock”. In spring sunshine, April 12 brought the opening of pub gardens and shops; restaurants could serve outdoor tables; zoos, theme parks, indoor ski slopes, libraries, hairdressers, gyms, climbing walls and drive-in cinemas could all open their doors for the first time in many months. Holiday cottages (technically “self-contained accommodation”) are allowed but hotels are still off-limits — until May 17 at the very earliest.</p> <p>That disparity has given rise to an unusual opportunity. Desperate to get their businesses going again, some country hotels are opening the cottages, follies, cabins and treehouses in their grounds as private holiday homes. During a five-week window, a few lucky guests will have the grounds of some of England's finest hotels to themselves.</p> <p>Amid the 500 acres of Lucknam Park in Wiltshire, for example, three stone cottages are available to rent, with champagne hampers waiting in their cosy kitchens — and the hotel swimming pool at guests' disposal. At Cliveden, the Italianate mansion in Berkshire (famous both as the setting for the Profumo scandal and as the place where Meghan Markle stayed the night before her wedding to Prince Harry), there is just one cottage on offer. A Tudor fantasy beside the Thames, its guests can explore the 375 acres of the estate's celebrated gardens after the gates have shut to daytrippers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, six hotels in the Pig chain are opening their collection of dovecotes, lodges, shepherd's huts and a former apple store, as well as outdoor restaurants in the grounds (with plenty of blankets and heaters). And at Chewton Glen, on the edge of the New Forest in Hampshire, the 14 treehouse suites — suspended 35 feet above the ground and set in 130 acres of woodland, gardens and parkland — are opening as self-catering rentals for the first time. Toasters and microwaves have been installed, although there is a helping hand with cooking: breakfast is delivered in hampers through a secret hatch, and there are takeaway pizzas from a wood-fired oven in the walled kitchen garden.</p> <p>At Gidleigh, we were staying at the Pavilion, a thatched, whitewashed cottage with barley-sugar chimneys that looks out over the croquet lawn. Inside, where the fire was already lit, there was a wood-panelled kitchen/living room, two big bedrooms and numerous little details to remind you that you were still in hotel-land rather than a conventional holiday let: safes in the cupboards, tiny pots of jam in the kitchen, bathrooms complete with abundant toiletries, swaths of fluffy white towels and those alarming round vanity mirrors that illuminate and magnify.</p> <p>We made a pot of tea and took some scones we'd bought on the way up to the terrace of the main hotel (where cream teas usually come with silver service and a £45-a-head bill). We watched the distant moor turn red in the late afternoon sun, while the kids, aged four and seven, cartwheeled, fired their bows and arrows, rolled down the grassy slopes and literally climbed the walls, claiming the grounds as their private playground.</p> <p>Though the stones of the steps and terraces and the fern-filled grotto look ancient enough, Gidleigh Park is actually far newer. In 1925, Charles McIlwraith, an Australian sheep farmer and shipping magnate who had recently bought the estate, commissioned Stanley Philpot, an architect from Tunbridge Wells, to build a new mansion here. In 1955 it was turned into a simple hotel, which grew smarter and more well known in the 1980s and 1990s. The current owner, Andrew Brownsword, bought Gidleigh in 2005, adding it to a collection that now includes another dozen hotels around the UK. He made his fortune with the Forever Friends brand, greeting cards and merchandise featuring a teddy bear design that Brownsword developed with artist Deborah Jones in a flat above a Chinese takeaway in Reading.</p> <p>Many regulars at Gidleigh — and at Cliveden, Lucknam Park and the others — would think it ridiculous to visit when the hotel was closed up. We peered through the windows of the illustrious restaurant (where chef Michael Caines made his name and won two Michelin stars, now with Chris Eden at the helm). And we wouldn't be getting a sniff of the 13,000 bottles of wine in the cellar. But for those less keen on formality, and for families, these five weeks offer a unique opportunity to experience the world of the country house hotel in a very different way.</p> <p>In the morning, Simon Franks, the general manager, came to see his first guests in four months, bringing a wicker hamper of breakfast, the weather forecast and some advice on walking routes. “It's just nice to see some new faces around here,” he beamed.</p> <p>We walked from the door, through the hotel's water gardens then up through woodland, past fields, across a cattle grid and on to the wild expanse of open moor. Daffodils and primroses were bursting out beside the paths, lambs a day or two old tottered on the bright green grass. From the summit of Kestor Rock, we could see almost 40 miles, all the way to Exmoor. You would need a heart of Dartmoor granite not to feel a sense of new beginnings and widening horizons.</p> <p>The kids, though, were happiest back in the hotel grounds. After supper they set out again, through the bluebell wood, past the beehives, across the shadowy putting course and back to the burbling riverside. As darkness began to fall, they roamed up and down the mossy boulders, playing pooh sticks, finding stepping stones, throwing rocks, climbing trees. After half a year of life shrunk to the few streets between our London house, the local park and their school, this was freedom on a grand scale.</p><p>Source: Tom Robbins 2021 'Lords of the manor: how to get a grand country hotel all to yourself ' FT.com 14 April.
