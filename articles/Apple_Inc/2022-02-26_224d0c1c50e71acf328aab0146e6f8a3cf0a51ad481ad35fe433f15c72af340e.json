  "text": "<p>I never normally get to hear first-hand from the thieves I write about, and this dinner party is my opportunity, so I've planned carefully. I sent invites coated in gold leaf to my guests — a buccaneer, a thief and three of the greatest kleptocrats to ever loot a nation. I was delighted when they all accepted and I planned a menu worthy of them.</p> <p>It's about excess, and my grandmother will do the food. She once fed me so much during a week's stay that my own mother didn't recognise me. I'm interested to see what she can do for five of the greediest people of all time. A challenge of that nature would paralyse an ordinary chef, but Granny just turns up the Aga.</p> <p>She was a bit of a homebody, so we'll be hosting the dinner at the farm, but I'll zhuzh up the dining room to make my guests comfortable — ice sculptures on the table; walls hung with those Renoir-does-soft-porn paintings kleptocrats favour; someone playing “The Girl From Ipanema” on a crystal piano in a corner. My grandfather will have to go out, though, or he'll make the guests talk about the Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>First to arrive is 18th-century pirate <strong>Anne Bonny</strong>. Reginald Jeeves meets her in the hall, takes her hat and cloak. She is through the door a few seconds before <strong>Auric&#xa0;Goldfinger</strong>, Bond villain and existential threat to financial stability in the mid-1960s. They make small talk about precious metal, Caribbean wealth havens and over-elaborate heists. Jeeves mixes rum cocktails and they nibble on cheese straws and pistachios.</p> <p><strong>Mobutu Sese Seko</strong> and <strong>Viktor Yanukovich</strong> travelled up together and hit the limo bar hard — 18-year-old Talisker for the deceased Congolese dictator, strawberry daiquiris for the deposed Ukrainian president — so they're not worried about the others having a head start. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16f7b890-1c23-11ea-9186-7348c2f183af\"><strong>Imelda Marcos</strong></a>, one-time Philippines first lady and possessor of 3,000 pairs of shoes, is fashionably late. She air kisses Bonny, waves regally to the others. She's not staying the night, so she's only brought 12 suitcases. Jeeves co-ordinates the unloading of her convoy, then mixes more drinks. I ask him to keep them coming.</p> <p>Chat centres on their favourite gems until Jeeves coughs discreetly to let us know our starters are on the table. Granny's been worrying that they won't appreciate good farmhouse grub, but she needn't have. They demolish their prawn cocktails (served in a Marie Rose sauce, on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce, with buttered Hovis). It doesn't take much to get Anne Bonny reminiscing about sailing out of the Bahamas, raiding treasure ships and burying the proceeds in remote unmarked coves.</p> <p>Marcos finds this hilarious and asks her to recount how she defied the governor of Jamaica, but Goldfinger wants to hear about the loot: what did she do with it after it was buried? Nothing, it's still there. He's making notes on the tablecloth, which Granny won't be happy about. Jeeves brings in more wine to go with the poached salmon, creamed spinach, red cabbage slaw, leek quiche, peas, carrots, broad beans (in a parsley sauce) and mashed potatoes. Yanukovich asks for some Coke Zero to mix with his white Châteauneuf-du-Pape. I notice Jeeves wince and he obliges with a distinctly stiff expression.</p> <p>Goldfinger knows about keeping bullion in Nassau but he loses Bonny when explaining how he could make a fortune by irradiating the contents of Fort Knox and forcing gold off its official price of $35 per troy ounce, and he never finds her again. “What is the point of stealing all that gold anyway? Why not just use a bank account?” asks Mobutu. And the conversation zags off, as the ex-dictator explains how it's easier to spend your wealth if you hide it behind a Swiss banker, rather than bolt it to a specially modified Rolls-Royce Phantom III and drive it across Europe. “How did you have time to enjoy it?” he asks, laughing enormously and downing his wine in one.</p> <p>Marcos has been pretty quiet but she begins to get competitive over who managed to buy more stuff on a single Parisian minibreak. Things are tense but fortunately Jeeves brings in the desserts and my guests lapse into stunned silence. Even the pianist breaks off from lamenting that the girl looks straight ahead, not at him, as bowl follows bowl. Granny has always been known to produce more puddings than there are people and she's excelled herself: pear pie, apple crumble, meringues, fruit salad, chocolate castle puddings, jam tarts, jelly, jugs of cream and custard, plus two different kinds of Viennetta.</p> <p>Yanukovich had been exploiting&#xa0;the gap in conversation to detail how much he spent on the world's largest-ever log cabin but, as the puddings pile up, he pales beneath his spray tan. The diners let out their trusses and pick up their spoons.</p> <p>“It's just too much,” Yanukovich admits at last, as he slumps beneath the weight of what he's consumed. An ice sculpture drips on to his sleeve but he's too far gone to notice.</p> <p>“It's no wonder you lost power — you've got no stamina,” says Mobutu, pouring himself more cream. “A real man eats everything on the table.” I signal for Jeeves to call for the limos.</p> <p>“Very good, sir,” he replies.</p> <p><em>Oliver Bullough is the author of ‘Butler to the World' and ‘Moneyland'</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Oliver Bullough 2022 'Oliver Bullough's fantasy dinner party — feeding the greed of Imelda Marcos and company' FT.com 26 February.
