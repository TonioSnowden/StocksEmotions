  "text": "<p>\n  Google Photos had me from the start with a killer feature: free, unlimited photo and video backup. The caveat? It compressed image files larger than 16 megapixels. </p><p>\n  I knew when the service launched in 2015 that the perk couldn't last forever. Millions of people dumping snapshots into the cloud? It wasn't sustainable. </p><p>\n  Next month, Google Photos is ending its free tier. After June 1, any newly uploaded media will count toward the 15 gigabytes included with any Google account -- unless you own a Pixel phone. That means your photos compete with your Gmail and anything in your Google Drive. If you had the account a while, you might be close to full. Many people will need to upgrade to a paid plan or back up their photos elsewhere. </p><p>\n  The change gives us freeloaders the opportunity to rethink the future of our digital memories. Here's a look at different online backup options. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Google Photos </p><p>\n  Good for: Photo search and sharing, and people who own Pixel phones </p><p>\n  Free storage: 15 GB across Google services, including Gmail and Drive </p><p>\n  Annual pricing: $20 for 100 GB (5 GB a dollar); $30 for 200 GB (6.6 GB a dollar); $100 for 2 TB (20 GB a dollar) </p><p>\n  Family sharing: Up to six members </p><p>\n  It wasn't cool for Google Photos to start charging. Still, it has a lot of features worth paying for, and some ways to save you money so you can avoid the most expensive tier. You can opt to upload your photos in slightly compressed resolution, rather than original, if you don't mind giving up a little quality for extra runway. In June, the app will provide a tool that can identify the dark or blurry images bloating up your library. </p><p>\n  The search is, unsurprisingly, excellent. Many services offer image search by face, but Google's is best -- and it recognizes pets, too. You can also search for activities like \"hikes\" or weather conditions like \"fog.\" </p><p>\n  Sharing is better. Each shared album has a message thread where you can see likes and comments from collaborators on specific pictures -- a fun way to relive a group trip. Partner sharing automatically shares photos between two people. You can limit partner access to pictures of selected faces, such as your dog and your kids. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Apple iCloud </p><p>\n  Good for: People who exclusively use iOS and Mac devices </p><p>\n  Free storage: 5 GB across iCloud, including phone backups </p><p>\n  Annual pricing: $12 for 50 GB (4.1 GB a dollar); $36 for 200 GB (5.5 GB a dollar); $120 for 2 TB (16.6 GB a dollar) </p><p>\n  Family sharing: Up to 6 members, but only for higher two tiers </p><p>\n  The idea behind iCloud Photos is that you have one mega library synced across all your devices. Of course, it's designed to back up Apple devices only. The service is very convenient -- you just turn it on in iPhone settings and photos are backed up as you take them. I recommend enabling Optimize Storage, which replaces photos and videos with lower-resolution versions in your local device library to free up space. You can tap to download full-size images from iCloud at any time. </p><p>\n  Just know that when you delete a photo from your iPhone or Mac, it removes the image from your iCloud backup. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Amazon Photos </p><p>\n  Good for: Prime members, people with Amazon devices </p><p>\n  Free storage: 5 GB </p><p>\n  Annual pricing: Unlimited photo, but not video, storage is included in the $119-a-year Prime membership; for access without Prime, or more video space, you would pay: $20 for 100 GB (5 GB a dollar); $60 for 1 TB (16.6 GB a dollar);  $120 for 2 TB (16.6 GB a dollar) </p><p>\n  Family sharing: For Prime members only, up to 6 people </p><p>\n  Amazon Photos is likely the most underused Amazon Prime perk. Members get unlimited, full-resolution photo storage using the app. The catch? Users are capped at 5 GB of total video storage. I found the backup speed to be slower than the others. Amazon solved this with its \"overnight backup\" feature, which lets you upload big batches while you sleep. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Microsoft OneDrive </p><p>\n  Good for: Microsoft Office and Skype users </p><p>\n  Free storage: 5 GB, including any files in OneDrive </p><p>\n  Annual pricing: $24 for 100 GB (4.1 GB per dollar); $70 for 1 TB (14.2 GB per dollar; includes Microsoft Office) </p><p>\n  Family sharing: Microsoft 365 Family ($100 a year), up to 6 people </p><p>\n  OneDrive doesn't have as many photo-specific features as its rivals. A spokeswoman said the web app is adding photo-editing capabilities later this month. Still, it's a good deal for Microsoft 365 subscribers, and comes with Office and 60 minutes of landline or international Skype calling. The service has native integration with the photos app on Samsung phones, called Gallery, and can store Samsung Motion Photos as well as 8K video. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Flickr Pro </p><p>\n  Good for: People who want a simple plan </p><p>\n  Free storage: 1,000 photos and videos </p><p>\n  Annual pricing: $60 </p><p>\n  Family sharing: Not available </p><p>\n  Flickr has a generous free tier and if you max that out, it offers one flat rate for unlimited uploads. It's good for those who don't want to worry about storage limits. The service offers nice tagging and organization options. </p><p>\n  There are limits: Each photo can be up to 200 MB -- more than plenty for mobile-phone photographers -- and each video can be up to 1 GB. </p><p></p>",
