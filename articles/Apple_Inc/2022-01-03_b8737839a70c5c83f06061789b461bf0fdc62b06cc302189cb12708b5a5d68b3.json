The Nasdaq Composite Index led the way Monday among stock benchmarks as “most investors take a more optimistic view on large-cap tech companies being potentially able to adapt to pandemic conditions,” said Timothy Chubb, chief investment officer at Girard, a wealth advisory firm in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.Even as Treasury rates rose across the board, the historically negative correlation between higher yields and the Nasdaq index “hasn't necessarily held today,” Chubb said via phone.</p><p>Travel chaos greeted the start of the year, with more than 2,600 U.S. flights canceled on Sunday, amid winter storms and shortages of workers due to the fast-spreading omicron variant.
