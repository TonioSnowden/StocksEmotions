  "title": "'Slow Horses' Season 2 Review: Cases Come in From the Cold; The accomplished second season of the Apple TV+ spy drama starring Gary Oldman as a British agent sees him investigating the prospect of Soviet sleeper agents awakening.",
  "text": "<p>Begins Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>Any season 2 is approached with apprehension, especially when a show has been as successful as this series was in season 1. But it may be even better now, with its likable misfits' various back stories revealed and the characters established—especially Jackson, played with a malignant flourish by Gary Oldman. His character may not be quite as flatulent as he was last time around, but is just as untidy and unhygienic. \"I've been busy,\" he tells his superior, the morally dubious Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas). \"I may have let myself go.\" She bestows upon him a withering glance, along with the funding for a case that requires actual energy and Jackson's unparalleled grasp of Soviet spycraft. You suspect he moons over Le Carré novels late at night, falling into a drunken sleep on a Slough House couch, in his unwashed socks. (Jackson does suggest an excessively dissipated version of Le Carré's George Smiley, whom Mr. Oldman played in \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\")</p><p>Matters ancient and Russian have suddenly come to his attention with the death of an old colleague, Richard Bough (Phil Davis), who is presumed to have had a heart attack aboard a bus. Jackson knows better. The last thing Bough wrote on his cellphone before he died was \"cicadas.\" What had long been thought a myth, dismissed by MI5, was that the Soviets had planted sleeper agents who, like cicadas, would emerge years later, even after the Wall came tumbling down. Bough's message prompts Jackson to rethink his agency's position on dormant cells.</p><p>His minions, meanwhile—among them the capable but maligned River Cartwright (Jack Lowden); Catherine Standish (Saskia Reeves), Slough House's fount of institutional knowledge; and the mysterious Shirley Dander (Aimee-Ffion Edwards)—assist in Jackson's pursuit of Russian assassins. River is looking for a new job, under the cautious advice of his grandfather, David (Jonathan Pryce), a retired agent himself; Min Harper (Dustin Demri-Burns) and Louisa Guy (Rosalind Eleazar), the lovingly mismatched couple among the outcasts, are freelancing for the unctuous James \"Don't Call Me Spider\" Webb (Freddie Fox), who when not sucking up to Diana is undermining Slough House and sending Min and Louisa into close proximity with some very dicey Russians. The perpetually obnoxious Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung) may be unbearable as a person, but as a techie he's invaluable, especially if someone wants to track a still living, breathing Bough toward his last bus ride through the closed-circuit corridors of the British transit system, or needs the lights shut down in a data center so Shirley can lift some discs.</p><p>Based on \"Dead Lions\" (2013), the second in novelist Mick Herron's \"Slow Horses\" series, the season has a determinedly cinematic quality that elevates it beyond most spy series, as does the first-rate writing. Mr. Oldman has the most delicious of roles and seems to enjoy playing a cynical, embittered, unhealthy and hilarious ringmaster in a bureaucratic circus. It's hard to say if \"Slow Horses\" is a comedy first, a thriller second. It straddles genres deftly, perhaps creating its own in the process.</p><p>'Slow Horses' Season 2 Review: Cases Come in From the Cold</p>",
