  "text": "<p>* Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00 were slightly higher at 32,180.</p><p>* Futures on the S&amp;P 500 ES00 were up 4 points, or 0.1%, at 4,028.</p><p>* Futures on the Nasdaq 100 NQ00 decreased 20 points, or 0.2%, to 12600.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 436 points, or 1.37%, to 32198, the S&amp;P 500 SPX increased 103 points, or 2.62%, to 4024, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 470 points, or 4.06%, to 12032. For the Nasdaq, it was the best one-day percentage gain since April 6, 2020.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Thursday's reading on second-quarter GDP showed the U.S. economy contracted by 0.9%, adding to the 1.5% contraction during the first quarter.</p><p>But instead of instilling a sense of panic in investors, stock futures retraced earlier losses as traders hoped that the weaker-than-expected number might pressure the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive with the pace of its interest-rate hikes during the rest of the year.</p><p>U.S. economists at Capital Economics argued that the number actually wasn't as bad as it seemed on the surface, as the contraction was driven once again by high inventories, as American companies continue to struggle with large stockpiles of goods acquired during the period when the economy was still struggling with the aftereffects of the COVID lockdown.</p><p>\"The 0.9% annualized fall in GDP in the second quarter is disappointing but doesn't mean the economy is in recession. The decline was partly due to a huge drag from inventories, while most other coincident indicators, particularly employment, show continued expansion,\" wrote Andrew Hunter, the senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>But Mohannad Aama, a portfolio manager at Beam Capital, said markets were mistaken in interpreting Powell's vague forward guidance as a signal that the central bank would slow the pace of rate hikes.</p><p>\"Yesterday was an overreaction and a misreading of what Jerome Powell was trying to communicate. The lack of forward guidance doesn't mean we're nearing a pivot it just means that there's more uncertainty ahead,\" Aama said.</p><p>Wednesday's surge in stock prices was fueled by Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that interest rates are now in the range of neutral territory and that the pace of hikes may slow, though he left another 75 basis point hike in September as a possibility.</p><p>See: Was Fed's Powell dovish or not? 4 key takeaways from Wednesday's press conference</p><p>In corporate earnings reports, Meta Platforms META, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, late Wednesday reported worse than forecast profit and sales and guided to revenue below estimates in the current quarter.</p><p>See: Facebook revenue declines for first time, and Meta's downfall is expected to get worse</p><p>Earnings are due from Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Mastercard MA after Thursday's market close.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Ford Motor Company F shares were up 6% in premarket trading after the carmaker reported a more than 50% increase in total sales during the second quarter.</p><p>* Shares of Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc.
