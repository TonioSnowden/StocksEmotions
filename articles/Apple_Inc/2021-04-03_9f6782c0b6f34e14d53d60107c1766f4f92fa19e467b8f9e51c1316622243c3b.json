  "text": "<p>Custom-made sports gear will help you go faster, ride further and keep you safer – while the experience will be eminently more comfortable. No two people are the same, so if you're passionate about your pastime, it's worth investing in these made-to-measure essentials.</p> <p><strong>Pyzel surfboard</strong></p> <p>Pyzel hand-shapes boards for athletes such as two-time world champion <a href=\"https://www.worldsurfleague.com/athletes/199/john-john-florence\">“John John” Florence</a> but also caters for beginners and intermediates. Deciding on the exact specification of your board is easy via its online board-builder – input the desired dimensions, fin configuration and custom artwork – or you can discuss your options over the phone. Expect to be asked about the types of waves you'll be surfing, your level of experience, style of surfing and physical parameters – six weeks later, you'll&#xa0;be riding the waves. <em>From £589.99, </em><a href=\"https://www.oceanmagic.co.uk/\"><em>oceanmagic.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><strong>Saffron Frameworks road bike</strong></p> <p>This outfit has collected numerous awards from its Thames-side workshop in south-east London. You won't find the semi-custom designs offered by many specialists here – each of the 52 bikes it builds annually begins with a blank canvas and is unique. The journey starts by&#xa0;discussing your individual requirements with founder Matthew Sowter, a skilled craftsman who&#xa0;is&#xa0;actively involved in building each bike, which will be finished to&#xa0;your specifications – from painted to polished stainless steel or anything in between. With 200 hours going into a top-spec model, expect a lead time of about eight months for this work of art. Good things come to those who wait. <em>From £2,515, </em><a href=\"https://www.saffronframeworks.com/\"><em>saffronframeworks.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>SnugsGo earphone tips</strong></p> <p>There is nothing more frustrating than a pair of earphones that constantly dislodge themselves when running, cycling or gymming. By slipping these custom-made earphone tips over your favourite pair of&#xa0;headphones, you'll keep them snugly secured in place. Simply load up the phone&#xa0;app, take a photo of each&#xa0;ear and the firm will manufacture your bespoke tips. <em>£99.95, </em><a href=\"https://snugs.com/\"><em>snugs.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Hexr cycling helmet</strong></p> <p>Hexr's intuitive iPhone app takes a 250,000-point scan of your head – just ask&#xa0;a friend to circle around you with your phone's camera, click submit and the data is instantly sent to the company, ready for&#xa0;3D printing. Three to four weeks later, your one-of-a-kind helmet, complete with custom text and image engraving, will arrive. Its protective inner is made from a&#xa0;honeycomb structure, which is not only efficient at absorbing energy – more so than the foam found in most helmets – but&#xa0;is also very breathable. <em>£299, </em><a href=\"https://hexr.com/\"><em>hexr.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>SunGod Vulcans</strong></p> <p>These full-framed cycling-specific sunglasses can be customised in more than 4,000 ways. There are eight colour options for the frame, icon and ear socks – play around with the online configurator until you find&#xa0;a combination you like. Then select from 10&#xa0;lens choices – there are&#xa0;various light transmission levels and two photochromic lens options (which darken with exposure to light). <em>From £150, </em><a href=\"https://www.sungod.co/\"><em>sungod.co</em></a></p> <p><strong>Valaiski skis</strong></p> <p>Valaiski owner Claudio Menz is on a mission to bring watchmaking precision to ski building. The Switzerland-based brand relies on&#xa0;craftsmen – each with more&#xa0;than 25&#xa0;years'&#xa0;experience – who hand-build each&#xa0;ski from scratch. They produce totally&#xa0;individual designs based on the customer's&#xa0;weight, height, skill and intended area of use. The ski has 13 layers – the most important being the central wood core, which is adapted to each owner&#xa0;– and can be finished with your chosen artwork or graphics. <em>From SFr 3,670 (about £2,850), </em><a href=\"https://valaiski.com/\"><em>valaiski.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Rawlings custom gloves&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>If baseball or softball are your sports, a&#xa0;custom Rawlings glove should be at the&#xa0;top&#xa0;of your wishlist. Go to the online custom-glove builder, choose your preferred glove shape, hand width, the position you play, your glove size and pattern. Then there's an almost unlimited&#xa0;selection of more superficial customisations – lettering, stitching colour,&#xa0;flags and so on – for a truly personal&#xa0;finish. <em>From&#xa0;$229.95, </em><a href=\"https://www.rawlings.com/\"><em>rawlings.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Snugg wetsuit</strong></p> <p>These wetsuits are made by hand in a Cornish workshop for superior comfort, fit&#xa0;and warmth. The process begins by sending in 21 measurements of your body&#xa0;(23 for women), from which founder Malcolm Ball and his team will cut, double-glue, blindstitch and heat-seal tape the seams of the Japanese Yamamoto-neoprene suit. Each one is built according to their intended use – whether surfing, swimming or windsurfing – and, of&#xa0;course, you can choose your own colours. It's hard to believe but the price&#xa0;is&#xa0;similar to (or even&#xa0;cheaper than) comparable off-the-peg suits. <em>From £203, </em><a href=\"http://www.snuggwetsuits.co.uk/\"><em>snuggwetsuits.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><strong>TheMagic5 swimming goggles</strong></p> <p>The brand's fanbase&#xa0;ranges from&#xa0;amateur swimmers to Olympians, but the common denominator is the need for comfortable goggles that won't leak or leave suction marks. The&#xa0;custom part of the goggles is the gasket&#xa0;(the piece that&#xa0;creates&#xa0;a seal around&#xa0;the eyes); the&#xa0;rest&#xa0;(the&#xa0;glass, strap&#xa0;and temples) is&#xa0;mass-produced. Once&#xa0;you've made your&#xa0;purchase, download the app onto&#xa0;your&#xa0;phone and&#xa0;take a 3D selfie scan&#xa0;of your&#xa0;face. A&#xa0;few&#xa0;days later you'll&#xa0;receive your goggles.&#xa0;<em>From £49, </em><a href=\"https://themagic5.com/\"><em>themagic5.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Carl Douglas racing shell</strong></p> <p>This specialist has been crafting wood-composite sculls since 1973 and is a leader&#xa0;in its field. Its boats are appealing to&#xa0;the eye but performance and durability are&#xa0;also key – each one has a four-layer laminate construction, which includes Kevlar (a robust heat-resistant fabric) and&#xa0;is&#xa0;very strong and stiff. Choose an exterior finish (including santos rosewood, mahogany or cedar), as well as bespoke lettering or motifs. The attention to detail is&#xa0;impressive – even the wooden seat is custom-crafted to the shape of your bum. <em>From £11,400, </em><a href=\"https://www.carldouglasrowing.com/\"><em>carldouglasrowing.com</em></a>&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Fergus Scholes 2021 'The new wave of bespoke sports gear' FT.com 3 April.
