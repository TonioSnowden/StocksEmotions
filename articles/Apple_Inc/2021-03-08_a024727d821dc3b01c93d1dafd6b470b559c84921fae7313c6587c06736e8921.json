  "text": "<p>Stocks declined on Monday as Treasury yields neared a one-year high, with shares of big technology companies and beneficiaries of the pandemic leading Wall Street lower.</p> <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 slid 0.5 per cent, as declines by mega-cap tech groups like Apple, Netflix and Amazon offset gains by more than 340 companies in the index. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.4 per cent, pushing it into a technical correction — indicating that it has fallen more than 10 per cent from a peak it hit last month.</p> <p>The tech declines have been spurred by the rise in long-term interest rates, as investors pencilled in a faster economic recovery. That view in markets was buttressed by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82be51e9-751b-43b7-92fd-7a95fcb99388\">Senate passage</a> of US president Joe Biden's $1.9tn stimulus bill, which includes $1,400 payments to many Americans.</p> <p>“If it does make it through the House relatively unscathed then you may see another round of US growth upgrades and probably more concerns about yields and inflation,” said Jim Reid, research strategist at Deutsche Bank. “The battle royale will continue.” </p> <p>Selling of US sovereign debt continued on Monday, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rising 0.03 percentage points to 1.6 per cent — close to its highest level in a year, after starting 2021 near 0.9 per cent. </p> <p>Higher borrowing costs have been seen as harmful to expensive portions of the stock market, as they reduce the value of future cash flows that highly valued companies are expected to generate. The real yield on the 10-year Treasury, which strips out the effect of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7982616a-e179-45f1-86f6-948f1fc35523\">inflation</a>, rose markedly on Monday, although it remains in negative territory.</p> <p>This has had a particularly sharp effect on the biggest gainers since the market trough last March as many high-growth stocks now trade at elevated levels compared with their earnings and revenues expectations. </p> <p>Investors in the $44tn US equity market have instead favoured shares of many of the hardest hit companies as they reposition portfolios for the recovery. Airline, resort and bank stocks all gained on Monday, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies rose 0.5 per cent.</p> <p>In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 index closed up 2.1 per cent, London's FTSE 100 added 1.3 per cent and Frankfurt's Xetra Dax climbed 3.3 per cent to a record high. But stocks in China tumbled, pushing the CSI 300 into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddd6a144-343a-43e2-996c-1f29ffa5e8d6\">“correction”</a> territory — defined as a 10 per cent fall from recent highs — after the index of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed shares closed down 3.5 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng sank 1.9 per cent.</p> <p>Closely watched data from the European Central Bank showed it had added €11.9bn of bonds to its holdings under the pandemic emergency purchase programme in the week to last Wednesday — down from €12bn the previous week and below the €18.1bn weekly average since the programme started last March.</p> <p>Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING, said the data would “come as another disappointment to the market”, which has been looking for signs that the ECB would take action to combat rising bond yields. </p> <p>The low headline figure, coupled with an ECB statement about the report's artificially small number owing to temporary factors, would “confuse the market over the degree of urgency” from policymakers, he added.&#xa0;</p> <p>Market reaction to the PEPP data was muted as traders awaited more details on the ECB's stance at Thursday's monetary policy meeting. The yield on the benchmark 10-year German Bund rose 0.03 percentage points to minus 0.28 per cent. &#xa0;</p><p>Source: Leke Oso Alabi and Joshua Oliver in London and Eric Platt in New York 2021 'Wall Street dragged lower by tech stocks and pandemic beneficiaries' FT.com 8 March.
