  "title": "Business News: Companies Thrived Despite Covid --- Results in 2021 improve on prepandemic numbers, with biggest businesses faring best",
  "text": "<p>Going into 2022, a surge in Covid-19 cases as a result of the Omicron variant is starting to weigh on U.S. businesses, keeping more workers home sick and leading some companies to cut services.</p><p>Government programs last year provided funding for businesses, helping them keep workers, while enhanced unemployment benefits and direct aid to consumers also kept income up, said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. \"The support to households was greater than in the past, so that really helped fuel consumer spending,\" she said. \"That's what fueled revenue growth and profits.\"</p><p>The rebound was real for smaller companies, but it is the biggest companies that fared the best, a Wall Street Journal analysis of corporate financial data shows. For large-capitalization companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, profits and revenue were hurt less by the pandemic's initial economic slowdown. The biggest companies also rebounded more quickly than smaller ones, even as uncertainty deepened over Covid-19 infection rates and the spread of variants, rising inflation and supply-chain woes. \"The larger firms are able to navigate the supply-chain issues a lot easier,\" Ms. Bostjancic said. \"They have scale and additional resources.\"</p><p>Companies in the S&amp;P 500 range from clothing retailer Gap Inc., with a market value around $6.6 billion, to Apple Inc., which surged to a nearly $3 trillion market value. The median S&amp;P 400 midcap company has a market value of about $5.7 billion, while the median S&amp;P 600 small-cap sports a $1.6 billion valuation, data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence shows.</p><p>Total sales at all three groups in the most recently reported quarter are up from the comparable period in 2019 -- and profit growth has been even stronger, data from Refinitiv show.</p><p>Within those groups, of course, results vary widely. Looking at the past 12 months of reported financials, sales at a third of small-cap companies still trail 2019 levels, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Midsize and large companies were more likely to have surpassed that benchmark.</p><p>Sales at beauty-supply retailer Ulta Beauty Inc. have risen 12% in the 12 months ending this fall over 2019 levels. In 2020, the company had to shut many of its stores for weeks at a time and refocus more intensively on its online operations, Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten said.</p><p>Ulta emphasized self-care products over makeup and expanded augmented-reality features and a program to let customers pick up online orders outside its stores, he said. In-person sales bounced back quickly after its stores reopened in the summer, making up 70% of full-year 2020 sales, and have remained strong. Profit margins have also bounced back, to 10.7% in the 12 months that ended this fall, from 3.6% in the same period in 2020 and 9.7% in 2019, S&amp;P data show.</p><p>\"The results in 2021 have been extraordinary by any measure,\" Mr. Settersten said. \"People are coming back to the stores but they're also continuing to shop digitally.\"</p><p>Even some companies that have caught up are still feeling the pinch. Brink's Co., in S&amp;P's midcap index, made fewer stops with its armored trucks, recording a 25% drop in revenue as the pandemic led businesses to scale back in April 2020, said CFO Ron Domanico.</p><p>In 2021, sales were recovering in those lines of business, growing about 3% a quarter, until the Delta variant slowed growth to about 1% a quarter this fall, Mr. Domanico said. Revenue has returned to about 96% of its pre-pandemic levels and the company doesn't expect a full recovery until later in 2022.</p><p>Brink's has more than made up for the slowdown in its pre-pandemic business with a series of acquisitions since early 2020. But the company's costs are also rising with inflation and labor shortages.</p><p>Overall, 12-month profit margins are up for public companies since late 2019, even amid rising costs. Here too, bigger companies are doing better.</p><p>Large-cap profit margins have long outstripped those of smaller companies. The decline in margins in 2020 was sharper for smaller firms as a group than it was for larger ones. The bigger companies also posted stronger margin growth over the past two years than small-caps.</p><p>Stung by the cash crunch that accompanied the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, many companies rushed to borrow when the pandemic hit in 2020.</p><p>Large companies were able to borrow large amounts, issuing a median $123.6 million in debt in the 12 months ending in late 2020. The year before, they only issued $6.4 million. In 2021, they started paying it down, cutting debt by $24 million on average, according to data from FactSet.</p><p>Midcap companies borrowed in 2020 too, but to a much lesser degree, and they also used the past 12 months to reduce their debt overall. Midcaps increased their borrowing by a median of $1.4 million in 2020, according to debt-issuance data from FactSet, but their median debt load declined by a median $6.2 million in the past year.</p>",
