  "text": "<p>While bay and bow windows add detail to the home's exterior, they also create an alcove on the inside. The bay window adds visual interest to a room because of the space it creates, said Beth Kooby, an Atlanta-based interior designer. In a past bathroom project, for example, Ms. Kooby placed a free-standing bathtub in a bay window (that she covered with cafe curtains). \"That gives you more space outside of that area for other things going on in the bathroom. Then the tub is the focal point,\" she said.</p><p>Bay windows provide clients with another much desired element, said Mr. Franck: coziness. Regardless of the scale of the house, people don't want to feel like they are lost in it, he said. \"Elements like a bay window provide that sort of coziness,\" he said. \"It kind of brings down the scale of the room into something that's much more intimate.\"</p><p>Four Homes for Sale With Bay Windows</p><p>Lookout Mountain, Ga. // $2.145 Million</p><p>A bay window with built-in bench seating is located in the breakfast nook of this limewashed brick house with six bedrooms, five bathrooms and two half-bathrooms.
