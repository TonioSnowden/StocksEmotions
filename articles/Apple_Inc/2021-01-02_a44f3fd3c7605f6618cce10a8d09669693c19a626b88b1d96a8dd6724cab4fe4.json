  "title": "Anne Marie Rafferty: ‘A new deal for nurses would be a positive from the pandemic'",
  "text": "<p><strong>Anne Marie Rafferty, 62, is professor of health policy at King's College London and president of the Royal College of Nursing. She was appointed CBE for services to healthcare in 2008.</strong></p> <p><strong>What was your childhood or earliest ambition?</strong><br>I certainly knew what I didn't want to be: I knew from a very early age that I was gay, and I used to pray, as a Catholic, that I wouldn't be. I was a real tomboy. I guess if I wanted to be anything it was a footballer. I was pretty good, considerably better than the boys I played with.</p> <p><strong>Private school or state school? University or straight into work?</strong><br>State schools: St Marie's primary school and St Andrew's High School, both in Kirkcaldy, Fife. I&#xa0;wouldn't have been able to go to university without a full grant — student nurses these days don't have the same level of support and we want to address that. I went to the University of Edinburgh, the first to offer an undergraduate degree in nursing, then worked clinically at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and in Nottingham at Queen's Medical Centre. I combined Nottingham with a part-time MPhil. I knew I wanted to do more research, and I was, I think, the first nurse to get a DPhil from Oxford.</p> <p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor?</strong><br>Linda Aiken from the University of Pennsylvania. I went there on the Harkness fellowship in health policy and we're still collaborating 25 years later. She's so generous with her time and talent. I also take my hat off to Charles Webster, my DPhil supervisor. Our current principal at King's, Ed Byrne, has also been really supportive: I owe him a great debt of gratitude.</p> <p><strong>How physically fit are you?</strong><br>I've become moderately fit. I&#xa0;cycle, I try to play tennis and I jog. Getting up from the floor gets increasingly difficult — I'm starting to understand how older people can fall and not be able to get up.</p> <p><strong>Ambition or talent: which matters more to success?</strong><br>A mix of both. They run in tandem. </p> <p><strong>How politically committed are&#xa0;you?</strong><br>Quite. One of the highlights of my RCN role has been campaigning. I definitely have a passion for making a difference. I am left of centre.</p> <p><strong>What would you like to own that you don't currently possess?</strong><br>A beach hut. </p> <p><strong>What's your biggest extravagance?</strong><br>Probably food. I love going to restaurants — with that comes conviviality and conversation. And travel.</p> <p><strong>In what place are you happiest?</strong><br>Running along the Fife coastal path. Being by the sea. For me, happiness is tied up with peace of mind and calmness.</p> <p><strong>What ambitions do you still have?</strong><br>To hold on to my health. I'd love to see a new deal for nurses as one of the positive things to come out of the pandemic. And I'd love to sort out my forehand in tennis.</p> <p><strong>What drives you on?</strong><br>When things I see are wrong, I&#xa0;feel a moral compunction to do something about it. I've got quite a&#xa0;strong sense of social justice. I am also driven along by the energy and enthusiasm of others.</p> <p><strong>What is the greatest achievement of your life so far?<br></strong>Being here: physically and mentally. I have gone through some pretty bleak and dark patches in my life and have thought about ending it many times. Professionally, getting my DPhil — that was a big jump. And&#xa0;being elected fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. I am one of the few nurses to get in.</p> <p><strong>What do you find most irritating in other people?</strong><br>People who talk across other people, don't listen, interrupt, don't let others finish what they're saying.</p> <p><strong>If your 20-year-old self could see you now, what would she think?</strong><br>She would be shocked and stunned: “This has got to be some kind of joke, someone has to be playing a trick on me.”</p> <p><strong>Which object that you've lost do you wish you still had?</strong><br>My classic Ford Fiesta was stolen. She was a real wee beauty, in mint condition, and I was very attached to her.</p> <p><strong>What is the greatest challenge of our time?</strong><br>What the pandemic is revealing about rampant discrimination across race, class and gender lines. A potentially apocalyptic future is staring us in the face: the fragmentation of society. We're hearing a lot of pain from people whose voices haven't been properly heard before.</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife?<br></strong>I try not to. But my Catholic upbringing gets the better of me:&#xa0;the catechism, all those images&#xa0;of&#xa0;purgatory and hell. As a Scottish Catholic you get the worst of all worlds.</p> <p><strong>If you had to rate your satisfaction with your life so far, out of 10, what would you score?</strong><br>Nine. Academics never give 10.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
