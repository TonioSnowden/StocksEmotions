  "text": "<p>Twitter investors breathed a sigh of relief that it reported only a “modest” impact from the Apple privacy changes that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e80d420-ee96-4b2e-a58c-ed323d93ba74\">thwarted Facebook owner Meta's performance</a> last week, but were left underwhelmed by the social media company's first set of quarterly numbers under its new chief executive. </p> <p>Shares in Twitter initially rose by as much as 9 per cent in pre-market trading on Thursday, boosted by an expanded $4bn share buyback scheme. But by the time regular trading began in New York, investors had cooled on the news, leaving the stock broadly flat at about $37. </p> <p>Tech stocks have been particularly volatile during the industry's earnings season this month. Meta's stock lost more than 25 per cent — or $220bn of its market value — after poor results, which it blamed on restrictions to advertising targeting on iPhones, as well as increased competition from TikTok. </p> <p>Shares in Snapchat's parent Snap and Pinterest also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d463f655-4b29-4048-982c-c04375df6ce5\">gyrated</a> last week, reversing losses in the immediate aftermath of Meta's results, to record strong one-day gains after their latest results turned out to be better than Wall Street had feared. </p> <p>Thursday's earnings report from Twitter was the first since Jack Dorsey <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf45fd08-51d1-41bb-82cd-b3157a5da055\">stepped down</a> as chief executive in November, with former chief technology officer Parag Agrawal taking the helm. </p> <p>Twitter's sales rose 22 per cent to $1.57bn in the fourth quarter of 2021, roughly in line with consensus estimates, as the company has expanded into new revenue streams such as subscriptions. </p> <p>Its average monetisable daily active users — logged-in users to whom it shows advertising — increased 13 per cent year on year to 217mn, just shy of Wall Street expectations of 218mn.</p> <p>The group also announced a $4bn share repurchase programme, $2bn of which it intends to acquire on an accelerated basis. This replaces a previously announced $2bn share buyback programme in 2020, of which there was $819mn remaining. </p> <p>The San Francisco-based company said it expected Apple's iOS changes to have an “ongoing modest impact” into the first quarter of this year, saying it was “confident” it could “navigate future potential changes”. </p> <p>However, Twitter's overall push to build new products faster — under increasing pressure from investors — meant costs and expenses rose 35 per cent to $1.4bn in the quarter as the company ramped up hiring. This squeezed operating income, which fell 34 per cent year on year to $167mn, below consensus estimates of $175mn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Twitter said it expected a rise in revenues to between $1.17bn and $1.27bn in the current quarter — broadly in line with consensus. </p> <p>In his first call with analysts since taking the top job, Agrawal indicated few changes to Twitter's broader strategy of improving personalisation and broadening the range of topics discussed on its platform. He said he had “line of sight” to the company's target of reaching 315mn monetisable daily active users by the end of 2023. </p> <p>“In my first 10 weeks on the job I have been focused on improving our execution,” said Agrawal, who has worked at Twitter for more than a decade. That includes a new operating model which he said would improve internal accountability and speed up decision-making. </p> <p>“Our purpose is to serve the public conversation,” he said.</p><p>Source: Hannah Murphy in San Francisco and Tim Bradshaw in London 2022 'Twitter dodges Apple changes as sales rise 22%' FT.com 10 February.
