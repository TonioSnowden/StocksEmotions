  "text": "<p>\n  Some of the biggest corporate dramas that have played out in the news over the past few years are now being presented as TV series and documentaries. This week, we look at series and documentaries about Theranos Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Boeing Co., and the people behind them. Here's where to stream them all: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   'The Dropout' </p><p>\n  (Hulu) </p><p>\n   Hulu's eight-episode series \"The Dropout\" takes a fictionalized look at the rapid rise of Elizabeth Holmes, her healthcare startup, Theranos, and the spectacular fall of both. </p><p>\n  Michael Showalter, one of the show's directors and executive producers, says the creators wanted the show to be dramatic, but have a satirical comedy element to it. </p><p>\n  \"The actress playing Elizabeth needed to be able to balance the comedic and dramatic elements,\" he said in an email. \"More than that, she would need to fuse them together and also find Elizabeth's darker, more enigmatic traits.\" </p><p>\n  The role went to Amanda Seyfried, an actress who received an Oscar nomination last year for her performance \"Mank.\" In an interview, Ms. Seyfried said some aspects of Ms. Holmes's life were instantly familiar to her. She says they both grew up on the same music, turned out for the dance team in high school and knew what they wanted to do with their lives before graduation. But she calls Ms. Holmes an enigma. Even after studying her and watching hours and hours of depositions and interviews with Ms. Holmes, she says: \"I still don't know anything about her.\" </p><p>\n  She does, however, have a better idea of how to portray Ms. Holmes. In addition to capturing her walk and unique voice, Ms. Seyfried says she also tried to master the way she listened, which she describes as \"dutifully, almost aggressively.\" </p><p>\n  \"I made a decision to half listen -- like, actually hear what they were saying in order to respond -- and the other half was showing that I was listening,\" she says. \"Which we do sometimes. It's not a bad thing. It's just, you're playing a part. And I think that a lot of times she was playing a part for various reasons.\" </p><p>\n   The Dropout begins streaming Thursday on Hulu. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   'Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber' </p><p>\n  (Showtime) </p><p>\n  \"Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,\" is based on the story of how Travis Kalanick created a culture- and industry-disrupting company, but his behavior ultimately cost him his job. </p><p>\n  The seven-episode series is narrated by Quentin Tarantino, with a cast that includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Mr. Kalanick, Kyle Chandler as venture capitalist Bill Gurley and Uma Thurman as former Uber board member Arianna Huffington. The series is based on Mike Isaac's 2019 book of the same name. \"Super Pumped\" is being marketed as an anthology series, with future seasons dedicated to different corporate narratives. The show has already been picked up for a second season, based on Mr. Isaac's forthcoming book about Facebook. </p><p>\n  \"Super Pumped\" is created by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, two of the co-creators and co-showrunners of Showtime's \"Billions.\" In an interview, Mr. Koppelman said that Mr. Isaac sent him the book early, and he immediately recognized the kinds of characters in the story that he and Mr. Levien find compelling. That is, people who believe that the world must be changed, that they're the ones to do it, and who actually do go about accomplishing it. </p><p>\n  \"We're fascinated by the people who do that, the people who empower the people who do that, and the people who both reap the rewards of that and pay the price for that,\" he says. \"And in 'Super Pumped,' you have all of that wrapped up in one story that did change the world for better and for worse.\" </p><p>\n   \"Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber\" airs Sunday nights on Showtime and can be streamed on services including Hulu and Amazon with a Showtime subscription. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   'Downfall: The Case Against Boeing' </p><p>\n   (Netflix) </p><p>\n  The new documentary \"Downfall: The Case Against Boeing,\" tracks what the filmmakers see as the wide-ranging failures that preceded the 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, from inside the company to the regulators and elected officials meant to keep an eye on the airline industry. </p><p>\n  The documentary includes voices from pilots, former employees, politicians and reporters who have covered the company -- including now-retired Wall Street Journal reporter Andy Pasztor. \"Downfall\" traces the origins of the crisis to Boeing's 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas. The sources point to the merger as a change in corporate culture, with a new emphasis on profitability and speed. </p><p>\n  After its Feb. 18 release, \"Downfall\" was one of the 10 most-watched English-language films globally on Netflix for the week, according to the company. </p><p>\n  The film was directed by Rory Kennedy, the youngest child of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and a prolific documentarian whose films include the Oscar-nominated \"Last Days in Vietnam.\" In an interview, Ms. Kennedy says there are stories that lend themselves to fictionalized accounts, but presenting the story of the 737 MAX tragedies was uniquely suited for documentary storytelling. </p><p>\n  Ms. Kennedy says she wanted to make something that would last through time so that people could look back, see the original documents and \"hear from the people who were on the front lines, so that they can understand, I think, on a deeper level, what people went through.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Streaming Notes: </p><p>\n  -- The GameStop Doc: \"Gaming Wall Street,\" a two-part documentary that looks at last year's GameStop short squeeze, premieres Thursday, March 3, on HBO Max. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- The We Series: The corporate yarns just keep coming. On March 18, Apple TV+ premieres \"WeCrashed,\" a series about WeWork. It stars Jared Leto as WeWork's charismatic former CEO, Adam Neumann, and Anne Hathaway as his wife, Rebekah Neumann. </p><p></p>",
