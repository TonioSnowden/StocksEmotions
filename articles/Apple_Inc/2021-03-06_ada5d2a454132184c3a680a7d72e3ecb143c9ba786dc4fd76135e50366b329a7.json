  "text": "<p>The metaphor of the beehive standing for the industrious society is, perhaps, a little overused. This self-contained city of Stakhanovite workers toiling together to harvest and produce, each with their defined role, has served as an idealised model for capitalism, the Protestant work ethic, communism, banking, freemasonry, Mormonism and much more. Beehive ornaments — little ribbed baskets shaped like a bishop's mitre — adorn buildings across the world, from churches to stock exchanges, town halls to temples.</p> <p>What these decorations show is a skep, a traditional ribbed, woven bulbous basket. To extract the honey, a keeper would probably have had to kill the hive — which does sound like a metaphor for extreme capitalism, though not one our own queen bees of industry might choose.</p> <p>That skep is only a tiny part of the incredible history of hives, which stretches back 4,000 years. The hive has always had — at least until two centuries ago — a multiplicity of designs. </p> <p>A new book by artist Aladin Borioli, co-written with Ellen Lapper, about buildings for bees features many of those often weird, occasionally brilliant, sometimes bananas manifestations of apiary architecture and reinforces the age-old bond between bees and people — symbolic, artistic and essential.</p> <p><em>Hives, 2400 B.C.E. </em>—<em> 1852 C.E.</em> features beehives that look like wicker men, others moulded into the form of heads and shoulders or with crudely carved folk figurines attached. They are shot through with a strange anthropomorphism as if the cells of the honeycomb were an approximation of those of a body and the bees all our biological processes. </p> <p>There are ruddy peasant faces and a “Madonna of the Bees” — logs carved like figureheads and bodies with turbans and top hats, all containing colonies. Then there is the architecture, from simple ancient clay tubes to complex skyscrapers, clusters of apian towers like a buzzing Manhattan.</p> <p>The book looks a little like an anthropological scrapbook, a collection of historic photos, archive material and drawings, a free association of beehive dreams and nightmares. Borioli is a Swiss artist and amateur beekeeper who started out by helping his grandfather near his home in Neuchâtel. “I was an artist and I needed a topic,” he says. “So I thought, why not?” And bees became his business.</p> <p>“I found a book by Juan Antonio Ramírez,” he says, “about the history of architecture and the poetics of beehives.” (I look at my notes: he might have said “politics” but that's fine too.) In the book, <em>The Beehive Metaphor: From Gaudí to Le Corbusier</em>, Ramírez attempted to understand how the image of the beehive — particularly its modernisation in the mid-19th century into the boxy, orthogonal form we are familiar with today — had influenced modern architecture. It is an intriguing, if not always entirely convincing, story of how one efficient environment for captive creatures can serve as a model for others — in our case, the commuter classes.</p> <p>For Borioli it was the trigger, seeing the housing of bees as an architectural and cultural phenomenon, rather than a merely apicultural one. But instead of using metaphor like Ramírez and many others in western culture, Borioli's book is a tightly focused project, an archive of 375 images stripped from their contexts, throwing light on the way we have built over the past four millennia, for both bees and ourselves. </p> <p>The “story is not presented in a classical linear written body”, says Borioli in the book, “but comes in a polymorphous way, mixing graphic design, photography and writing”.</p> <p>“I studied visual anthropology,” he says, “and this book is the legacy of that. It was [strongly] influenced by the <em>Bilderatlas Mnemosyne</em> of Aby Warburg.” In 1927, Warburg, a German cultural historian, started compiling this visual scrapbook of images pinned to screens, tracing connections between artworks by theme and symbol rather than by style or era. For Borioli to choose beehives as his theme, picking up recurring symbols and references in these images, so many of which are hauntingly odd, puts him exactly in this heritage.</p> <p>The modern hive is efficient but dull, though full of political meaning. Patented in 1852 by the Reverend Lorenzo Langstroth in the US, with its moveable frames it seems to have been the last great innovation in beekeeping architecture. It certainly evokes contemporary political parallels: the hive, with its dominance of one kind by another, its extraction of value from labour and its stealing of resources, is a metaphor for both imperialism and slavery. It is no accident that the bees are referred to as a colony.</p> <p>Borioli asks whether, as technology and our understanding of agriculture, the environment and medicine are changing so fast, beehives have made any progress lately. Has anything got better for the bees, in precipitous decline thanks to modern chemicals? </p> <p>“Beekeeping techniques and especially hives' structure seem to have stopped evolving,” he writes. Despite a long history “of architectural diversity and amazing structure innovation . . . those white boxes have colonised beekeepers' gardens and apiaries”.</p> <p>This book is a striking visual history of a lost art of architecture in which bees were ascribed symbolic and cultural as well as practical value. Now they are in trouble, perhaps we might be prompted to re-examine the homes we build for them, to acknowledge their centrality to our agriculture, our horticulture and, more surprisingly, our visual culture. </p> <p><em>Edwin Heathcote is the FT's architecture critic.
