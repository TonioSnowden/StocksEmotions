  "title": "Facebook Parent's Results Rattle Investors --- Meta shares plummet after sharper-than- expected profit decline and revenue forecast",
  "text": "<p>The company said it expected revenue growth to slow because users were spending less time on its more lucrative services. It cited inflation as a weight on advertiser spending and estimated that ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple Inc. last year would cost Meta some $10 billion this year.</p><p>Meta also lost about a million daily users globally and user growth stagnated in the U.S. and Canada, two of the company's most profitable markets, the results show.</p><p>The earnings report shows Facebook's business is under pressure on a number of fronts, at a moment when Mr. Zuckerberg is betting the company's future on virtual-reality headsets, augmented-reality glasses and virtual worlds, known as the metaverse, in which users can live and work.</p><p>\"Although our direction is clear, it seems that our path ahead is not quite perfectly defined,\" Mr. Zuckerberg told investors during a conference call on Wednesday.</p><p>Meta executives said they expected first-quarter revenue between $27 billion and $29 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 3% and 11%. Anything below 11% would mark the slowest period of quarterly growth in the company's history.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg said the company is investing heavily in its TikTok rival, called Reels, and focused on attracting young-adult users, although those segments aren't currently as profitable as older features like the news feed and Stories, which allows people to post videos and images that disappear after 24 hours.</p><p>\"I'm confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term trade off,\" he said, noting Reels is the company's fastest-growing product.</p><p>Executives likened the shift to Reels to prior strategic transitions, including the company's shift to mobile about a decade ago.</p><p>Meta faces several antitrust investigations around the world, for what some government officials describe as its pattern of using its clout to squeeze out smaller rivals. During the call, Mr. Zuckerberg and other executives emphasized that Meta faces stiff competition from TikTok for users' time, particularly the younger demographic.</p><p>Meta reported a $10.3 billion profit for the fourth quarter, below analyst expectations of $10.9 billion, and a small decline compared with a year earlier. This marked Meta's first decline in net-income growth since the second quarter of 2019.</p><p>Meta also for the first time broke out results for its Reality Labs segment, which offered investors insight into the health of the virtual- and augmented-reality consumer business unit that is at the heart of the metaverse efforts. The Reality Labs unit posted a $3.3 billion loss, an amount that has grown consistently in recent quarters.</p><p>Upon announcing the name change in October, Mr. Zuckerberg said the company expected \"to invest many billions of dollars for years to come before the metaverse reaches scale.\"</p><p>Investors said the pairing of slower revenue growth with higher spending on initiatives like the metaverse is a troubling combination. \"I'm going to spend a lot of time creating this new thing and I'm getting less revenue: It's not a match made in heaven,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer of investment firm Bokeh Capital.</p><p>Meta's results were a contrast to fellow digital-ad giant Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which on Tuesday reported blockbuster results that sent shares up more than 7% Wednesday.</p><p>Meta executives said the company is working at a disadvantage due to Apple's changes that require apps to ask users for permission to track their activity and share it with other apps or websites. The move has been at the center of an intensifying fight between the iPhone maker and companies such as Meta that use such tracking technology to sell digital ads.</p><p>\"It's not really apples to apples for us. And as a result, we believe Google's search ads business could have benefited relative to ours,\" Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said.</p><p>Mr. Wehner pointed to Apple's business relationship with Google, adding \"the incentive clearly exists for this policy discrepancy to continue.\"</p><p>Meta continues to face criticism over revelations in The Wall Street Journal's \"Facebook Files\" series, which showed the company knows its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm. Those articles spurred congressional hearings, prompted a rebuke from Facebook's oversight board and led the company to halt work on a version of its Instagram app focused on children.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
