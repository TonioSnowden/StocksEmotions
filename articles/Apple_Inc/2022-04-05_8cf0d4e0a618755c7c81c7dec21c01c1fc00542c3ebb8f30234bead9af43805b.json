  "text": "<p>We're living in a time when an at-home gym setup, enabled with cameras and artificial intelligence, can replace personal trainers—or at least they can try.</p><p>On Tuesday, Peloton released its first product for classes with weights and floor exercises, a $295 TV-connected camera called the Peloton Guide. That's right, the company behind the pandemic-popular exercise bike launched…a camera?</p><p>The Guide doesn't use the screen on the Peloton Bike or Tread. Instead, it turns your TV or computer monitor into a big-screen player for Peloton's fitness content and a digital mirror to reflect your workouts. While Peloton's stationary bicycle and treadmill still function if you stop paying the $39-a-month fee, this hot-dog-size webcam is built entirely around the subscription service.</p><p>The camera connects via HDMI cable and either sits on a table or clips to your TV. An included remote control is used to navigate the interface. A privacy cover can slide over the camera's lens to protect you from unwanted snooping.</p><p>It's like a Roku streaming device, but for Peloton workouts. Peloton already has an app on Roku, as well as on Apple TV and Chromecast—for subscribers of both its premium and less expensive app-only plans—but with the Guide, the experience is supercharged. It shows metrics from a dedicated Bluetooth heart-rate band such as heart rate, and an AI-powered Movement Tracker senses when you perform each exercise. (Peloton said no video data is shared with the company and processing happens on-device.)</p><p>While there are benefits to AI keeping an eye on you during workouts, other products on the market work as well or better, so unless you're a Peloton die-hard, think carefully before buying.</p><p>How It Works</p><p>After starting a class, the camera turns on and I appear on a Zoom-like video tile, right next to the instructor. The video is supposed to help you assess your form, and you can adjust the size and shape of your window. (I found the 50-50 horizontal split to be the most effective.)</p><p>The camera and AI also analyzed my movements to sense if I was performing the class's designated exercise or acceptable variations. It's like one of those dance videogames: As I low lunged, the Movement Tracker's on-screen icon filled up. If I performed a completely different move—say, a standing bicep curl instead of that lunge—the tracker didn't budge, and I didn't get credit for that exercise.</p><p>The idea is to bring accountability and motivation to workouts that aren't typically driven by stats.</p><p>In a bike class, you can compare your power output to other users on the leaderboard. In a running workout, you can see your speed and distance. There isn't an equivalent metric for strength training, other than heart rate.</p><p>The Movement Tracker also informs what's called Body Activity, a new feature that shows which muscle groups you've exercised recently and recommends classes to balance out your fitness regimen.</p><p>The tracker didn't add much to my experience, though. Seeing myself on-screen was more impactful—I could more easily mimic the instructor's form and make adjustments. Self-view during a workout helps ensure proper form and reduce the risk of injury, said Zakkoyya Lewis-Trammell, an assistant professor of kinesiology at California State Polytechnic, Pomona.</p><p>But frankly I hoped for more form correction and other personalized guidance from something called a \"Guide.\" Unlike the competitors I mention below, Peloton's smart camera doesn't even count reps. It just tracks that you did the movement throughout the allotted time.</p><p>Ben Schultz, director of product management at Peloton, said the company has looked at rep counting and form feedback, and intends to expand the product's features in the future.</p><p>For people who already own a Peloton Bike or Tread and frequently do the platform's strength workouts, the Guide could be worth it. The personalized class recommendations take the time-wasting guesswork out of choosing your next class. And it's nice to see yourself and heart-rate metrics displayed together on a large TV.</p><p>I subscribe to the app version of the service ($12.99 a month) and stream workouts on my phone or tablet. I'm a fan of Peloton's high-quality content, but I'm not all-in on the hardware. The early version of Peloton's smart camera didn't compel me to upgrade my subscription or justify its price.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What smart strength-training gadgets do you find most helpful? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Another concern: What happens when I drop the subscription, or Peloton stops supporting it? In 2019, Peloton ended support for bikes manufactured before 2016. But at least they still work as \"dumb\" exercise equipment. With the Guide, there's nothing you can do without Peloton's service and support.</p><p>The Competition</p><p>If you're looking to make your first smart-gym purchase, consider the Guide's competition.</p><p>Mirror, a smart display from Lululemon, ($1,495 plus a $250 delivery fee and $39-a-month subscription) works with connected ankle weights and dumbbells, sold separately ($50 to $200), that can be paired for rep counting. There's a camera on board, but it's used for Zoom-like add-on sessions with personal trainers, not AI body tracking.</p><p>Tempo Move ($495 plus $39 a month) looks like a sleek end table but inside, it houses a collection of weight plates. On top, a smartphone dock connects your iPhone to a TV to stream Tempo's library of classes. The iPhone's front-facing TrueDepth camera, used to authenticate Face ID, analyzes your form and potential range of motion. The software also counts reps and automatically registers the weights based on their color. I didn't trigger much feedback from Tempo, though it did warn me I was incorrectly leaning back during a move. (The company said it's working on Android support.)</p><p>Tonal, a smart, wall-mounted cable machine, is for the most enthusiastic weightlifters. You can move its articulating arms up or down, depending on the exercise, and provide adjustable resistance in 1-pound increments up to 200 pounds.</p><p>A camera embedded in the touch-screen display is currently dormant, the company said, but it could be activated for future applications. Sensors inside of the machine capture movement speed and distance data to track reps and analyze form. As I lazily lowered into a goblet squat, a pop-up nudged me to try to go lower. At $3,490 plus a $49-a-month membership, Tonal is pricey, and that's not counting the installation fee.</p><p>Still, compared with high-end gym memberships, any of these connected fitness options could eventually save you and your family money—provided you use them.</p><p>—For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter .</p><p>Write to Nicole Nguyen at nicole.nguyen@wsj.com</p><p>Peloton Guide Review: The Strength-Training Smart Camera Faces Strong Competition</p>",
