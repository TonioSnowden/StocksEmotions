Ned Lamont's administration unveiled an $8 billion to $10 billion plan Monday that aims to reduce commuter rail times from Connecticut to New York City by as much as 25 minutes by 2035, while pledging in the meantime to make the trip from New Haven to the Big Apple 10 minutes faster as early as 2022. </p><p>\n  The announcement came on the same day Metro-North Railroad returned eight trains to the New Haven Line, as demand for commuter rail service increases as the region emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. Another service increase is planned in August. </p><p>\n  While much of the Time For CT initiative is dependent upon passage of a large federal infrastructure bill, state Department of Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti said the state has received enough federal funding to embark on some of the work needed to alleviate longstanding slowdowns including improvements to signalization systems. \"We're going to be able to start running some express trains that are going to take out 10 minutes of travel time.\" he said. </p><p>\n  Representatives from both Metro North and Amtrak lauded the latest effort to try to speed up commuting times along a section of rail line that has been plagued for years by slowdowns. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  NEW JERSEY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Budget Deal Includes </p><p>\n  Some Tax Givebacks </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  New Jersey residents would get a number of tax benefits under an agreement the state's Democratic governor and Legislature unveiled on Monday. </p><p>\n  Gov. Phil Murphy, Senate President Steve Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin said Monday they had reached a deal on what they are calling tax-relief measures as part of the fiscal year 2022 budget. The proposals could affect nearly one million families, though the largest among them -- a rebate of up to $500 to families -- was announced last year as part of a deal to raise taxes on those making more than $1 million. </p><p>\n  The other changes hardly put a dent in the $10 billion surplus the state is carrying into the fiscal year. \"Stay tuned,\" Mr. Murphy said when asked what other tax benefits or new programs residents might be getting in the new budget. </p><p>\n  Republicans applauded the tax givebacks but called them inadequate. \"While we're happy there's tax relief there should be a lot more going back to the hardworking citizens of New Jersey,\" said GOP Assemblyman Hal Wirths. </p><p>\n  The current budget expires on June 30, and officials must pass a balanced spending plan by then. </p><p>\n  Among the measures unveiled Monday: Checks of up to $500 will be mailed to families making up to $150,000 for joint filers or up to $75,000 for those filing individually. Filers must also have at least one dependent child. The amount of the rebate is the amount of taxes paid, but capped at $500. The rebate would go to about 760,000 families. It costs $319 million. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  ATLANTIC CITY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  N.J. Legislators Move </p><p>\n  To Extend Oversight </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill Monday that would extend the state takeover of most of Atlantic City's major decision-making powers for another four years. </p><p>\n  If the bill is signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy, the state will have been in charge of the city's major functions for nine years at the end of the latest measure. Mr. Murphy campaigned on a pledge to end the takeover, which was designed to help the state curb runaway expenses, high taxes and poor governance. He reversed his stance after taking office. </p><p>\n  The move came on the same day that two City Council members called for the New Jersey State Police to take control over the Atlantic City Police Department amid a surge in violent crime. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
