  "text": "<p>It is after dark and three items glow around my desk: the mustard yellow lamp, my old iPhone, on charge for the third time today, and my laptop screen, the portal to the whole world. I have been skipping through emails, gently bypassing my energy company's second exhortation to send a meter reading, to go off in search of some half-remembered facts about <em>Moby-Dick</em> and the cost of living crisis of the 1800s.</p> <p>Despite the current surging fuel prices, I am looking for a fact dimly recalled: that it would have taken the average worker half a day to earn enough money to light their home for an hour in 1851, the year Melville's novel about the Nantucket whalers was published. It wasn't the price of electricity that caused the problem then. It was the lack of it.</p> <p>Gas lighting, from coal gas, was arriving slowly in streets and civic buildings. But at home, once the sun had set, your options were limited to candles — the rich used beeswax, the poor tallow from animal fat, smoky and smelly — or dim oil lamps or darkness.</p> <p>The desire for a clear, bright light created the vicious and dangerous pursuit of Moby Dick and his brethren. In a cavity above the brain of a sperm whale was to be found spermaceti, a clean-burning waxy substance that was prized for lamps and candles.</p> <p>The price of an evening of light, of learning, of enlightenment, was bloodshed. The whaling industry went from pole to pole for this bounty, with an estimated 300,000 slaughtered before 1900. “Butchers we are, that is true,” says Ishmael, the narrator of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. But the world pays us “the profoundest homage . . . for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn to our glory!”</p> <p>The fact I was searching for, now found, was from a 1996 essay on lighting and real wages by economist William Nordhaus, who deduced that an hour's worth of quality lighting (1,000 lumens) before 1800 would have required a week's labour for the average person. By 1850 it was down to three hours. Even now that prices in the UK are tipping up to 28p per kWh, the desktop lamp, the 9-watt LED that illuminates my desk, costs just about a quarter of a penny for an hour. &#xa0;</p> <p>Once electrification got going, it was like the miracle of the loaves and the fishes: the same amount of electricity could do more and more, its usefulness amplified as costs fell.</p> <p>Within 100 years of <em>Moby-Dick</em>, electricity was the norm — creating extended office hours, more productive factories and technological advancement. In postwar homes, television sets, vacuum cleaners and fridges suckled happily at the grid. In the UK, the electricity board used to have local showrooms to persuade you to consume even more by buying an electric-hungry cooker or hairdryer.</p> <p>Another half-century later, the internet had arrived. From the comfort of an office or a sofa, a vast library of information and entertainment came via a computer screen, backlit to boot.</p> <p>We are now well beyond an old calculation that electricity is a labour-saving device: the comparison of household laundry done by hand compared with time saved by using a washing machine. Now we have the luxury of shouting at our Alexa to turn the lights down and turn the music up. Electricity is also now the conduit of our laziness.</p> <p>There are good reasons not to be blithe about the price hikes in fuel that are causing the cost of living crisis. Combined gas and electricity bills rises of up to 50 per cent are especially painful for low-income households — with more price hikes due in the autumn. There aren't two grades like tallow candles versus spermaceti. What now is the choice? Turn off the hot water, turn off the fridge? At its most basic, it is a regressive charge. (Why not link universal credit to its price?)</p> <p>But even though our homes are now designed around electric goods and services, average energy consumption has gone down across the board. In 2005, 126 terawatt hours were used in UK homes. That was the peak. In 2019, that was down to 104, largely due to more efficient appliances. And this despite an increase in population.</p> <p>Our cost of living crisis has shown up various governments for mismanaging national strategies. Our domestic luxuries have provided us both comfort and distraction from the twin sins of burning fossil fuels — still the source of most electricity — and being compromised politically by those who supply this ease of living: see Russian gas supplies in Europe.</p> <p>But viewed over the distance of centuries, electricity has been cheap, too cheap perhaps to recognise not just its value in the progress of man but also at what cost it has come. The sperm whale population never recovered.</p> <p><em>Follow Joy </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joy_lo_dico?lang=en\"><em>@joy_lo_dico</em></a></p> <p><em>Luke Edward Hall returns next week</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Joy Lo Dico 2022 'The price of lighting our homes has always been steep' FT.com 13 April.
