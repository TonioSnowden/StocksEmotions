  "text": "<p>Epic Games, maker of <em>Fortnite, </em>announced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24d4378a-6977-4ed8-be63-23c9bf9df366\">this week</a> that it had secured $2bn from Sony and the company behind Lego to build a gaming “metaverse”.</p> <p>Beyond the nebulous and as-yet unrealised concept of an avatar-filled virtual world, the partnership reflects a more urgent battle: acquiring the intellectual property needed to dominate the games industry. </p> <p>That is also a good way to understand Microsoft's proposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3726a3a-c4a0-4761-a82c-cda98abc3cb7\">acquisition</a> of Activision Blizzard for $75bn, announced in January. Satya Nadella, chief executive, spoke fuzzily about that deal helping a gaming metaverse. </p> <p>But the transaction also unlocks access to Activision's games portfolio including <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em>. This acquisition built on others they have made in this space. Since 2017, Microsoft has bought nine independent studios, not to mention <em>Skyrim</em> developer Bethesda.</p> <p>Less than two weeks after the Microsoft-Activision deal, Sony reacted by acquiring<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f34d42bb-776a-4163-b881-b0ede4f38301\"> the maker of the <em>Halo</em> franchise </a>Bungie for $3.6bn. Investment in Epic helps to further ensure that the Japanese maker of PlayStation has a pipeline of new titles. </p> <p>These moves come as both Microsoft and Sony battle it out to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/11/video-game-developers-cash-influx-tech-firms-compete-deals-netflix\">become the ‘Netflix for gaming'</a> — a one-stop shop for all your gaming desires. And there is forthcoming competition. Apple, Amazon and Netflix are also building up streaming services for gamers (see Netflix's gaming acquisitions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2339f6ae-fb26-4a32-981b-492e2e984f3b\">here</a>).<br><br>Owning the rights to a strong stable of games is crucial because, just as with TV streaming, you need regular incentives for users to pick your platform and keep coming back. </p> <p>Games like Epic's <em>Fortnite</em> have huge communities that will follow them anywhere, so will prove attractive to tech companies looking to move into streaming or any other part of the gaming ecosystem. The most popular titles can also be further monetised by being turned into long-running franchises that are updated each year, such as Electronic Arts's long-running <em>Fifa</em> football series. </p> <p>The talk of futuristic gaming metaverses will capture attention. The more immediate prize is valuable IP. </p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Honda plans to invest $40bn on electric vehicles<br></strong>The carmaker plans to launch 30 models by 2030. The company had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/313cd95e-4ded-47a9-a06b-50e8e520e714\">previously pledged to phase out petrol-powered cars by 2040</a>, so will need to amp up production of zero-emission vehicles to make this transition feasible.<br><br><strong>2. Meta is testing how to monetise the metaverse<br></strong>Mark Zuckerberg has announced that <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/meta-horizon-monetization-test\">a handful of VR content creators</a> will be allowed to sell virtual items in Horizon Worlds, Meta's social metaverse platform, to test what resonates with users. Meta will also award goals-based bonuses to some creators if they hit certain engagement metrics.<br><br><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Nokia exits Russia<br></strong>The Finnish telecoms equipment maker is the latest company to pull out of the Russian market because of the war in Ukraine. Nokia has 2,000 employees in the country, most of whom will now face redundancy. Meanwhile, it will <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-12/nokia-exits-russia-saying-it-s-not-possible-to-stay?srnd=technology-vp\">cede its space in the 5G market </a>to Chinese rivals Huawei and ZTE, which have already won big contracts to supply 5G networks to Russia's biggest carriers.</p> <p><strong>4. NSO Group's private equity manager risks being ousted in court battle</strong><br>In more turbulence for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72560975-5c15-4b9e-a95e-efc0c5559e98\">Israeli spyware maker</a>, the US consultancy that oversees the €1bn private equity fund that owns NSO Group risks being forced out of the role after a judge in London ruled that a legal bid to oust it can go to trial.<br><br><strong>5. Inside Ukraine's radio war</strong><br>Why would a 21st century Russian army send so many unencrypted radio signals on the battlefields of Ukraine? And how can we confirm their legitimacy? Our new film looks at how volunteers around the world are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/4adad9c9-151b-4448-8547-908b49d74fde\">intercepting communications between Russian soldiers</a>, using equipment as cheap as £30. </p> <h2>Tech tools — Huawei MatePad Paper</h2> <p>If you cannot be parted from your ereader, but wish it had a bigger screen, keep reading. &#xa0;</p> <p>With its 10.3-inch high-resolution E Ink screen, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/tablet-reviews/huawei-matepad-paper-review/\">the Huawei MatePad Paper </a>is larger and more versatile than a typical Kindle. The stylus it comes with adds extra value, allowing you to turn your ereader into a sketchbook or a notebook when the mood suits. The MatePad Paper lets you annotate books, has a strong voice recorder and will even let you turn handwritten notes into emails. Is it worth the $550 price tag, though? It is an excellent alternative to a Kindle, but it cannot compete with true multipurpose hardware like a tablet.</p><p>Source: Rachel Banning-Lover 2022 'Ignore the metaverse.
