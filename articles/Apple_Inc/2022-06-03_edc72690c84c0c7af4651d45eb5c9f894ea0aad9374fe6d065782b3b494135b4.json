  "text": "<p>HERE WE ZOOM AGAIN We've had to find ways to tuck offices into our homes wherever we can, even under a staircase, as in poet Mary Jo Salter's take on the remote-work era (below). PHOTO: Cookie Moon</p><p>These six original works written for The Wall Street Journal by six astute American poets reflect the realities of our lives, but they do so with enough musicality and rhythm to tweak our perspective, to help us sidestep the mundane, maybe for a minute, maybe longer. Mary Jo Salter riffs on a dreamlike moment in her home office; Victoria Chang recalls the green lawns of summer. Two poets laureate—Alyssa Gaines and Daniel B. Summerhill—turn their thoughtful attention to fashionable objects—while Robert Wrigley imagines the top-of-the-world elation of being in a treehouse. And make sure you join in a toast to the season with Dorothea Lasky, who captures the sensation of a sip of bubbly. —Donna Bulseco </p><p>BLADE RUNNER Traditional, monoculture turf is waning in popularity. At ProTime Lawn Seed, in Portland, Ore., for example, sales of alternative lawn seed and meadow-seed mix have increased about 25% per year since 2017. PHOTO: Cookie Moon</p><p>Elegy for a Lawn</p><p>By Victoria Chang</p><p>As a child, I pushed the mower up and</p><p>down our lawn, overlapping a little,</p><p>thinking I was caring for a meadow.</p><p>The sound of the mower became</p><p>summer, not the bird's wings ticking in their</p><p>dark coats. Broomstraw, wild rye, fescue,</p><p>no longer wait for my feet and four wheels.</p><p>And the blade which once cut off a</p><p>neighbor's finger. I looked at the nub in</p><p>secret, wondered where the missing part</p><p>went. Now I think of the air that traveled so</p><p>freely in the empty space. The final hundred days</p><p>of rain. The memory of dry grass fencing in</p><p>the wind, and nothing to replace it.</p><p>Victoria Chang, who lives in Los Angeles, is the author of \"The Trees Witness Everything\" (Copper Canyon Press), her sixth poetry collection. </p><p>CHECK MATES Classic Slip-On, $60, Vans.com PHOTO: Cookie Moon</p><p>In Praise of Floating</p><p>By Daniel B.
