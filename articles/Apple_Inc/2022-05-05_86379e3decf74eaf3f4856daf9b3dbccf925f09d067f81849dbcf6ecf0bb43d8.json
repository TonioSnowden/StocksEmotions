  "title": "The 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5's Futuristic Appeal; Though comparable to the Kia EV6, Hyundai's Ioniq 5 separates itself from the EV pack with modern exterior styling that signals an electrified ride",
  "text": "<p>But, really, the daughter was steering. M'lady was quite starry-eyed over the Ioniq 5's cubistic cuteness, which seemed age-appropriate given that the Ioniq 5 looks like it's made of stacked Minecraft blocks. A simple, almost naive design motif of repeating boxes, like eight-bit pixels, unites details including the interior door trim, the charge-port door and LED taillights.</p><p>I could have signed Dad to a long-term lease on the spot, the poor sap. He said he had been looking but these birds are still pretty rare. I explained that sales of the Ioniq 5—the first offering from Hyundai's sub-brand for electrics—have been limited to a few EV-certified dealerships in 26 states, at last count, most observing California's Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program.</p><p>Kia's EV6 is pretty much the same car as the Hyundai, I offered, but it's available in all 50 states. Daughter seemed not at all interested in the un-boxy one. There hangs a tale.</p><p>But first, how about some boilerplate? The Ioniq 5—midsize, four-door, five-seat hatchback—is built on the same skate-like platform as the Kia and takes a similar approach to the retail market. The base model SE Standard Range ($41,195, before available tax credits) has a single rear motor (168 hp) and 58.0 kWh battery pack, good for 220 miles of range. Long Range models step up to a 77.0 kWh battery pack, good for up to 303 miles, says the EPA.</p><p>All-wheel drive versions feature the larger pack and the additional motor up front, delivering a dexterous, potent, digitally managed 320 hp. The entry point for long-range AWD is $48,745 (SE AWD). But if you really want to indulge yourself with government funds, you crave the maximally equipped Limited AWD ($57,440), like our test car.</p><p>Shoppers, please note that both batteries are 800-volt systems, so they are able to digest DC fast charging (a maximum 235 kW). The opportunity here is that some penny-wise buyers, with access to home charging and limited routine driving, could live happily with the smaller battery, knowing that rapid recharging is out there, if needed.</p><p>Features and options vary a little between the Ioniq 5 and EV6, but in the main the cars are two answers to the same question. What separates them is exterior styling. The EV6's streetside presentation—characterized by its low roof, turret-like window openings and soft-shouldered, sinuous shape—speaks a familiar, even traditional idiom for sporty hatchbacks. It doesn't scream electric, in other words.</p><p>With a face like Boba Fett's helmet, the Ioniq 5 and its future intent pack a wallop. Please consider the dramatic diagonal light lines along the sides that intersect and interrupt the lower body trim. Alas, on the driver's side this detail looks a bit like an incised-metal Z, as if it was out of the Russian army's motor pool.</p><p>Same car, only different. Hyundai Motor Group's design leadership clearly means to put some distance between the two brands' visual identity in the era of electrification. And yet it's curious: Kia is supposed to be the more youth-appealing, hamster-loving of the two, but it's the Hyundai with the symmetry-breaking modernism.</p><p>The Ioniq 5 feels stout, solidly assembled, with a gliding, soft-singing effortlessness around town and a whispering strength on the highways. I would call it dead quiet, but there was occasional rattling from the rear cabin of our test car I could not isolate (seat belt?). And everyday quick: Our matte-gray test car waltzed away from ostentatiously fast cars between stop lights, including a motorsports-tuned Dodge Challenger that didn't give up so easily.</p><p>With its low center of mass and wide stance, the Ioniq 5 has a confident handling character, with little body roll in fast curves and fairly high cornering limits. The two-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel has a good hand. As for ride quality: not great. Our tester sat on tarty 20-inch aluminum wheels with spars and center-cap all painted black like goth fingernails. These look wicked but toughen up the ride.</p><p>Compared to the daring outside, the Hyundai's interior style seems deliberately quotidian. The signature bit is the dual-display panel, combining the driver's instrument screen (some kinky energy-flow graphics there) and the center touch screen, all in a white, iPod-like frame propped atop the dash console.</p><p>The Hyundai also retains the skeuomorphism of a Start button and physical gearshift stalk to the right of the steering wheel.</p><p>Other cabin notes: With the Limited trim, the front center console slides back and forth between the seats, which is both convenient and ergonomically smart. The seating comfort is quite good, the posture upright. If you want to relax while charging, the driver seat has a powered leg rest. The rear seat backs can also recline a bit.</p><p>You want features? The Limited throws the book at you. All of Hyundai's driver-assist systems, from lane-keeping to rear cross-traffic alert to head-up display, are included, as well as rain-sensing wipers, hands-free power liftgate, a full-length fixed sunroof and lots more. Navigation and Android Auto/Apple CarPlay are included with all cars.</p><p>The Hyundai also offers limited vehicle-to-load charging. Users can plug into the car's charging port with the external V2L adapter, about the size and shape of a vintage Ericofon handset. From there users can draw up to 1.9 kW of electricity, enough to supply an overnight campsite.</p><p>For EV doubters, this last item might be the most persuasive: The Ioniq 5 comes with Hyundai's usual 10-year or 100,000-mile powertrain warranty, in this case including battery pack, the onboard charger, motors and power electronics. Also included is five years of unlimited-miles roadside assistance.</p><p>They don't even have that in Minecraft.</p><p>2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited AWD</p><p>Price, as tested: $57,440</p><p>Propulsion: Battery-electric,with dual electric motors (174/165 kW, f/r) and full-time all-wheel drive with regenerative braking; 77.4-kWh 800-volt lithium polymer battery pack; 10.9-kW onboard charger</p><p>Combined power/torque 320 hp/446 pound-feet</p><p>Length/wheelbase/height/width 182.5/118.1/63.0/74.4</p><p>0-60 mph: 4.5 seconds (est.)</p><p>EPA est. mileage: 110/87/98 e-MPG city/highway/combined</p><p>EPA est. range: 256 miles</p><p>Maximum charging rate: 10-80% recharge in 18 minutes, up to 235 kW, with 350 kW DC fast charging</p><p>Curb weight: 4,663 pounds</p><p>Cargo volume: 27.2/59.3 cubic feet (Rear seats up/folded)</p><p>The 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5's Futuristic Appeal</p>",
