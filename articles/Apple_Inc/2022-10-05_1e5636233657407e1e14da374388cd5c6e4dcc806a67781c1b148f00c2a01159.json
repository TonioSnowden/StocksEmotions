  "title": "Arts in Review -- Television Review -- 'Mr. Harrigan's Phone': Dialing Into Dread",
  "text": "<p>Stephen King fans will respond immediately to the atmosphere writer-director John Lee Hancock creates at the outset of \"Mr. Harrigan's Phone\" -- a world of perpetual autumn and incipient unease, a white-clapboard Maine where the chill gets into the bones and the soul. It will generate such a familiar sensation among fans of Mr. King's fiction and its various adaptations that the effect may well be a Pavlovian dread.</p><p>Mr. King's status as a master of horror, and of fiction generally, is unquestioned, but had he written \"Mr. Harrigan's Phone\" in the year in which it is set -- 2003 -- he'd be considered a prophet as well. Based on one of the four novellas that make up the 2020 collection \"If It Bleeds,\" the story presents a title character so prescient about the woes of social media you'd think he was supernatural. Which he may well be.</p><p>The casually eerie is standard-issue stuff for a King tale, as is the young hero who narrates his own story: Here, Craig (played as a child by Colin O'Brien and as a teen by Jaeden Martell) is a young motherless boy when we first meet him who is enlisted after church one Sunday by the forbidding Mr. Harrigan (a pitch-perfect Donald Sutherland). Harrigan needs someone to come to his vaulted mansion once a week and read to him: The former business mogul's eyesight is failing and he'd like to revisit novels that he has, no doubt, already read -- \"Dombey and Son,\" \"Crime and Punishment,\" \"Heart of Darkness.\" Even in 2003, the $5 a week he pays Craig is a pittance, but the boy is getting an education in literature, economics and even politics.</p><p>\"I had forgotten how much I despised that socialist claptrap,\" Harrigan says, cutting Craig off during his recitation of \"The Jungle\"; his employer, Craig learns during a primitive internet search at the local library, was despised himself, as a corporate raider who dismantled companies and inspired suicides. That he gifts Craig regularly with Red Devil lottery tickets is one of the less subtle aspects of the story.</p><p>But when one of those tickets pays off, Craig presents Mr. Harrigan with an iPhone -- which the man instinctively rejects, until Craig shows the retired millionaire investor how he can track the markets in real-time. His attitude changes. So does his regard for books. He's trapped in the web just like the kids at Craig's high school, where only the coolest kids have iPhones. (It certainly seems like product placement, as does Craig's reading of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover,\" an adaptation of which will be on Netflix next month.) When Harrigan dies, Craig slips the man's phone into his suit jacket at the funeral, and begins getting texts from, he assumes, the great beyond.</p><p>Mr. Hancock (\"The Rookie,\" \"The Blind Side,\" \"Saving Mr. Banks\") gives us a teenager under stress -- early on, Craig is tormented by a Cro-Magnon bully named Kenny (Cyrus Arnold), which inspires Craig to ask Harrigan if he was ever bullied and how he dealt with his enemies. \"Harshly,\" Harrigan declares with finality. What he doesn't say is that retribution might be delivered from the hereafter, and that Craig might have a proxy in hell.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Anderson is the Journal's TV critic.</p>",
