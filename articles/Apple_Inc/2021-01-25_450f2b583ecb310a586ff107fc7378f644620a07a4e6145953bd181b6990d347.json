  "title": "Technology  ---  PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY:  There's More to Noise Canceling Than Noise  ----  By Nicole Nguyen",
  "text": "<p>\n  A leaf blower is blaring across the street. The dishwasher is running. My husband is typing harder than a toddler banging on a piano. </p><p>\n  My recipe for suppressing that din? Noise-canceling headphones and Spotify tuned to the Rain Sounds playlist. Press play and repeat. </p><p>\n  To be clear, even the best noise-canceling headphones can't offer total silence. But they can reduce the impact of whatever pandemonium is happening around you. And a number of new offerings recently hit the market, including Apple's extravagant over-the-ear AirPods Max and Samsung's fully wireless Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds. I spent hours testing the top models -- and by testing, I mean taking a lot of Zoom calls and listening to The Highwomen on repeat. </p><p>\n  Before you make the decision about which ones to buy, you need to decide which type to buy. </p><p>\n  No matter which kind you pick, it's important to find a good fit. Head size, ear shape and whether you wear glasses, hearing aids or earrings can affect the way headphones feel and sound. </p><p>\n  A good fit complements a headphone's noise-canceling abilities by physically limiting the amount of noise that can get in, says Nilo Casimiro, director of product management at Dirac, an audio-software company. </p><p>\n  \"The bottom line is that no two people hear identically,\" said Mark Steinberg, senior technologist at B&amp;H Photo, a professional media equipment retailer. Age and past exposure to loud environments have a significant impact on your hearing, he said. </p><p>\n  I suggest, if you have the time and willingness, trying multiple brands. Most companies offer generous return windows for online purchases. Just remember, if you're shopping online, take a look at the return policy before you buy. </p><p>\n  Whatever suits your needs best, here's how the top contenders compare. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  AirPods Max ($549) </p><p>\n   Pros: The AirPods Max sound really great. No matter the genre, audio delivery is balanced, detailed and spacious. </p><p>\n  The Max's Transparency mode, which lets in outside sounds, is the most natural of the headphones I've tested. Critically, this feature prevents shouting on calls and lets you hear what the other end is hearing. (Pro tip for those with loud children or pets: Use this feature while on calls. The noise cancellation is a little too good at blocking noise -- and just because you can't hear your surroundings, doesn't mean the people you're talking to can't.) </p><p>\n  The dial and button controls on the right earcup are much easier to use than touch controls found on others. </p><p>\n  Despite the extra weight of the Max's metal hardware (most headphones are plastic), they are comfortable -- even while wearing a face shield and KN95 mask on an 11-hour flight. </p><p>\n  And, of course, the Max supports Apple-exclusive features like easy pairing with other Apple devices, automatic device switching and surround-sound 3-D audio for supported apps. One unique feature is the Max's easily removable earcups (as long as you're willing to fork over $69 for replacements). </p><p>\n   Cons: That price! For $200 more than the competition, it's hard to recommend buying the AirPods Max just for slightly better audio quality. </p><p>\n  There are other drawbacks. While you can technically use the AirPods Max with Android devices or Windows PCs, it isn't a good experience. </p><p>\n  And there's no wired cable included -- it's sold separately for $35 and you can't store the cable inside the Max's case. When the battery runs out, the headphones won't work even with the cable plugged in. </p><p>\n  Then, there's the included case. It's terrible. It doesn't protect the most vulnerable part, the headband's mesh. There's no power button, so you have to use the case to turn them off immediately. (If you put the headphones down, they will go into a low-power mode after five minutes.) And it looks like a bra. </p><p>\n  Currently, AirPods Max are back-ordered by about a month. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Sony WH-1000XM4 ($350) </p><p>\n   Pros: These headphones with the clunky name (classic Sony) are among the top-selling models in the category, and it's easy to see why. The noise-canceling is fantastic, and the sound quality is good. </p><p>\n  The XM4s can be connected to two devices at once, and a nifty feature called Speak-to-Chat recognizes when you're speaking to let in ambient sound. </p><p>\n  The headphone's hinge allows for compact storage in its case, which has all the accessories you need for plane travel, including a dual plug adapter and 3.5mm headphone cable. </p><p>\n   Cons: The microphone occasionally makes you sound warbled, especially if you have a deep voice. The touch panel that allows play/pause and volume control often takes a few tries to register. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Bose 700 ($380) </p><p>\n   Pros: The noise-canceling capabilities on the 700s are similar to what I've experienced on the company's older QC 35 II model. But the microphone on these headphones is much improved. In noisy environments, the 700's microphone outperformed other over-ear headsets, minimizing the reverb of an echo-y space and isolating my voice from loud background noises. </p><p>\n  If you don't mind a blemish or two, Bose sells a refurbished version for $280. </p><p>\n   Cons: They aren't as compact as Sony's or Bose's older QC 35 model; the headphones don't fold in their case. While the Bose 700 supports multi-device connection, I found that my review unit made a cracking noise when connected to my laptop and phone simultaneously. A spokeswoman said the company is working with other customers who have experienced the problem to learn more. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Best Buds </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  I've already covered how to choose wireless earbuds, but a few new models with noise-canceling have arrived on the scene since then. The AirPods Pro ($209 at Walmart) are still the best choice for Apple users but due for an update. </p><p>\n  For Samsung users, the Galaxy Buds Pro ($200) are a significant improvement in fit and noise cancellation over the company's previous earbuds. Samsung-specific features like auto-switching and quick pairing make the buds an ideal choice for those with Galaxy devices. The low-profile design doesn't get caught on stuff and the software impressively blocks out wind noise on calls. </p><p>\n  For other Android devices, the Elite 85t ($200) are my pick. They deliver full sound, and the noise-canceling is on par with the AirPods Pro. Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds ($280) offer the best truly wireless noise-canceling experience, but the bulky design isn't for everyone. </p><p></p>",
