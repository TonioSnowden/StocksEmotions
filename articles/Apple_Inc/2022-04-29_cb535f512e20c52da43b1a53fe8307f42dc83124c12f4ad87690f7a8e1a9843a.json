  "text": "<p>The British Virgin Islands have been thrown into turmoil after a UK government inquiry recommended imposing direct rule by the London-appointed governor to tackle “appalling” failures in governance, the day after the tax haven's premier was arrested on drugs charges in Miami.</p> <p>Retired judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom, who led last year's inquiry into allegations of high-level corruption in the Caribbean territory, found that “almost everywhere the principles of good governance . . . are ignored” and concluded it was “highly likely” that serious dishonesty had taken place. </p> <p>He recommended suspending the BVI's elected government for up to two years.</p> <p>Publication of the long-delayed report was hastily brought forward after BVI premier Andrew Fahie was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d003b064-8c41-4217-8bbf-4e2383915f1e\">arrested by undercover American agents</a> in a sting operation at an airport in Miami on Thursday along with the BVI's port authority director, Oleanvine Maynard. </p> <p>The pair were charged with drug trafficking and money laundering. They appeared in court in Miami on Friday. Maynard's son Kadeem was also detained separately.</p> <p>The US operation began in October last year and is likely to raise questions about why the UK spent over a year on a public inquiry, which went into great detail on numerous smaller allegations of BVI government malpractice but did not deal with the more serious claims of top-level collusion with drug traffickers.</p> <p>It was instead American law enforcement officials who lured Fahie and Maynard to Miami-Opa locka Executive airport with the promise of $700,000 in cash stashed in designer shopping bags as payment for their help in facilitating drug shipments, according to a US criminal complaint. </p> <p>The UK inquiry's verdict is the latest blow to the BVI's reputation after years of accusations that it facilitated tax-dodging and money laundering. The islands are a British overseas territory, governed under a dual system whereby Britain sends a governor who is responsible for defence, policing and security while a locally elected administration handles other areas.</p> <p>The recommendation to suspend the elected government and impose direct rule could prove controversial in the Caribbean, where Britain's imperial legacy has been increasingly criticised in recent years. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b9fa9e7-1313-48da-be26-410ba235e0f1\">Barbados </a>last year jettisoned the Queen as head of state and some neighbours are considering following suit.</p> <p>Liz Truss, foreign secretary, instructed Amanda Milling, the minister responsible for overseas territories, to travel to the BVI immediately to speak to the governor and key stakeholders. “We will then announce a clear path forward,” she added.</p> <p>Hickinbottom was unequivocal. “Unless the most urgent and drastic steps are taken, the current unhappy situation — with elected officials deliberately ignoring the tenets of good governance . . . will go on indefinitely,” he said, citing multiple examples of dubious government contracts being awarded without scrutiny.</p> <p>The inquiry was ordered in January 2021 after outgoing BVI governor Gus Jaspert made allegations of corruption at the highest levels of the BVI government and possible collusion with drug traffickers. But no evidence of drug claims was presented to the inquiry.</p> <p>Fahie, 51, a flamboyant local politician who plays the organ at his local church and opens government meetings with prayer sessions, had vehemently denied the allegations. He spent several million dollars of public money hiring a top London public relations firm and law practice to defend his administration.</p> <p>The latest revelations are also highly embarrassing for Sir Geoffrey Cox, the Tory MP and former attorney-general, who was engaged last year to defend Fahie's administration at the inquiry. </p> <p>Cox stressed in a statement that he had represented the Virgin Islands government and not Fahie as an individual. “The role of a barrister is to give objective and independent legal advice and representation to his client regardless of who or what he is,” he said. “It implies neither approval nor disapproval of his clients' conduct”.</p> <p>Cox also emphasised that no information about official complicity in drug trafficking was heard in the commissioner's inquiry last year.</p> <p>The BVI has for years drawn fire from campaigners for hosting more than 370,000 shell companies used to control more than $1.5tn of assets around the world on behalf of undisclosed owners. The Panama Papers and subsequent offshore company leaks laid bare <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7f7a07b-656d-42c8-9919-5ae954357d98\">the abuse of such arrangements</a> by shady oligarchs and politicians to hide ill-gotten gains.</p> <p>UK and US law enforcement officials say that in recent years the BVI has become a favoured route for drug traffickers, with shipments of cocaine directed from Colombia via the islands and then on to the US. In November 2020, more than two tonnes of cocaine were seized at a property on the islands belonging to a serving police officer. </p> <p>News of Fahie's arrest came as a shock to the BVI's tightly knit population of 30,000. Governor John Rankin called for calm and said that acting premier Natalio Wheatley would remain in charge for the time being. &#xa0;</p> <p>Anne Milgram, head of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/divisions/headquarters/dea-administrator-anne-milgram-releases-statement-following-arrests-british\">said </a>the arrests were “yet another example of DEA's resolve to hold corrupt members of government responsible for using their positions of power to provide a safe haven for drug traffickers”.</p> <p>Fahie had complained to an undercover DEA agent during a meeting that “the British didn't pay him much”, according to the court filing. In a meeting earlier this month, the premier agreed a 12 per cent commission on the US sale price of cocaine smuggled via the BVI in return for allowing three-tonne shipments, the court document said. At one point, it said, the premier pulled out a calculator and worked out his share at $7.8mn.</p> <p>The pair even discussed staging a few drug busts on the islands to allay suspicion and make it look like Fahie was serious about fighting traffickers, according to the filing. In an earlier meeting with the undercover agent, Maynard had said: “You see with my premier, he's a little crook sometimes . . . he's not always straight.” </p> <p>Phil Mason, a former head of the UK Department for International Development's overseas territories department and an anti-corruption expert, said that London had historically been reluctant to get deeply involved in the overseas territories.</p> <p>Fahie's arrest, he said, “begs the question of how much of a blind eye the governors were turning” to problems in previous years. “The British government usually just wants the whole place to be peaceful and quiet and leaves the chief ministers to their own devices,” he added.</p> <p>“The bigger question is whether Fahie is a bad apple or the tip of an iceberg,” he said. “I suspect very strongly that he is the tip of an iceberg.” </p><p>Source: Michael Stott in London 2022 'UK report into BVI slams ‘appalling' governance after premier arrested' FT.com 29 April.
