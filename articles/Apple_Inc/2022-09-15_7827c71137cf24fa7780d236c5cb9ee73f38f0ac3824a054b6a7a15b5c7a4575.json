  "title": "Amazon hit with antitrust lawsuit from California, which claims seller rules are increasing consumer prices; 'For years, California consumers have paid more for their online purchases because of Amazon's anticompetitive contracting practices,' state's attorney general says in announcing suit",
  "text": "<p>\"For years, California consumers have paid more for their online purchases because of Amazon's anticompetitive contracting practices,\" Bonta said in a statement.</p><p>\"With other e-commerce platforms unable to compete on price, consumers turn to Amazon as a one-stop shop for all their purchases,\" he added. \"This perpetuates Amazon's market dominance, allowing the company to make increasingly untenable demands on its merchants and costing consumers more at checkout across California.\"</p><p>In-depth: Amazon has mostly avoided antitrust scrutiny, but that is changing</p><p>At a news conference Wednesday, Bonta said his office has been working on the case for the past 2½ years, and that the lawsuit is supported by interviews with sellers, data and \"widespread\" evidence that includes internal Amazon files.</p><p>\"In this economic climate, we need to do all we can to help consumers who are paying artificially inflated prices,\" he said.</p><p>The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, asks the court to prohibit Amazon from continuing to engage in anticompetitive conduct and to appoint a monitor to ensure compliance, and seeks damages as well as civil penalties of $2,500 for each violation of the state's unfair competition law — which his office said could be a significant number. The attorney general's office estimates that the company has at least 25 million customers in California.</p><p>\"The collective magnitude of harm here is very far-reaching,\" Bonta said at the news conference. \"We're sending a message to other companies: If you use your power to harm Californians, we'll see you in court.\"</p><p>The lawsuit also takes aim at Amazon's wholesale policy, in which the company's suppliers agree to \"be punished if they discount or fail to prevent discounting by Amazon's rivals, thereby powerfully disincentivizing that discounting.\"</p><p>Third-party sellers and wholesale suppliers have told the attorney general's office that they would offer lower prices or allow discounts on other sites if it weren't for Amazon's pricing policies, according to the lawsuit. The suit also states that major online retailers that compete with Amazon have confirmed to the attorney general's office that sellers have told them they cannot offer lower prices or discounts because of their agreements with Amazon.</p><p>Amazon — whose business practices are also being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and targeted by Congress — has faced similar lawsuits over its third-party-merchant policy elsewhere. Earlier this year, an antitrust lawsuit by the District of Columbia was dismissed but is under appeal, while another lawsuit in Washington state was allowed to proceed.</p><p>An Amazon spokeswoman said Wednesday: \"The relief the AG seeks would force Amazon to feature higher prices to customers, oddly going against core objectives of antitrust law. We hope that the California court will reach the same conclusion as the D.C. court and dismiss this lawsuit promptly.\"</p><p>The key difference between the D.C. and California lawsuits is that Bonta also asserts the state's Unfair Competition Law, \"which outlaws any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice,\" said Katherine Van Dyck, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit organization that advocates against concentrated economic power. \"And it's being pursued in a state with a very long history of robust consumer protection and antitrust enforcement,\" she added.</p><p>As for the potential impact of California's lawsuit, she said \"any time a company with nationwide practices is forced to change them in a state the size of California, there is a good chance those changes will be implemented across the board.\"</p><p>California's Unfair Competition Law was cited by a judge in the landmark Epic Games Inc. v. Apple Inc. AAPL antitrust suit in the only beneficial ruling for \"Fortnite\" maker Epic in that case; Apple has appealed that verdict and the case is ongoing.</p><p>For more: Epic v. Apple could be a legal marathon as appeals wend through system</p><p>Bonta has cited the state's unfair competition law in filing a brief in support of fair competition in the legal battle between Apple and Epic, though the brief stressed that the state was not taking a side in the fight.</p><p>Amazon shares were trading less than 1% higher in after-hours trading Wednesday. The stock has declined 23.3% so far this year, as the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has declined 17.5%.</p><p>Amazon hit with antitrust lawsuit from California, which claims seller rules are increasing consumer prices</p>",
