  "text": "<p>   Meanwhile, Parler is back up, but still banned from the Apple and Google app stores. Without those essential routes to users -- and without web services as reliable as its former provider, Amazon -- it seems unlikely that Parler can grow anywhere close to the rate it otherwise might have. It's not clear whether Parler's new content filtering algorithms will satisfy Google and Apple. How the company balances its enhanced moderation with its stated mission of being a \"viewpoint neutral\" service will determine whether it grows to be a viable alternative to Twitter and Facebook or remains a shadow of what it could be. </p><p></p>",
