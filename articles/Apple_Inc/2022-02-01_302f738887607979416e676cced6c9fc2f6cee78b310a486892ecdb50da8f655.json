  "title": "Trump Reports $122 Million Political War Chest as He Weighs 2024 Bid; Former president doled out donations to dozens of Republican candidates in the second half of last year",
  "text": "<p>The political war chest is an unprecedented amount of money for a former president to wield as Mr. Trump seeks to maintain his hold on the Republican Party. The cash on hand total was about the same as the Democratic and Republican national committees reported to start 2022—combined.</p><p>Mr. Trump has yet to definitively say whether he will run again after losing the 2020 election, but he has resumed holding political rallies and teased a potential presidential bid. In a statement announcing the fundraising figures, Taylor Budowich, the former president's communications director, said Mr. Trump is \"incredibly well positioned to look beyond November.\"</p><p>The latest campaign finance filings, which cover the second half of 2021, show that Mr. Trump remains the main online fundraising draw in the Republican Party. On the Republican donation platform WinRed, Mr. Trump's political operation raised $18.3 million more than the second-largest online fundraiser, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, over the six-month period.</p><p>The bulk of Mr. Trump's available political cash—about $105 million—is sitting in a leadership PAC called Save America, which issues press statements, candidate endorsements and donation solicitations. The rest is housed in MAGA PAC, a multicandidate committee that formed out of Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, and a donation conduit committee called Save America joint fundraising committee.</p><p>The money in these committees can't be directly spent on a presidential campaign. Still, it can bankroll all manner of activities meant to maintain Mr. Trump's stature within the party, including rallies, advertising, compiling donor lists, polling, staff and donations to other candidates.</p><p>During the first half of 2021, Save America PAC, which can donate $5,000 per election to a campaign, made no donations to other GOP campaigns. But during the second part of the year, the committee donated $5,000 each to 41 federal campaigns of 2022 candidates Mr. Trump has endorsed.</p><p>Among those receiving federal campaign donations were Sens. John Boozman (R., Ark.), Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), John Kennedy (R., La.), Rand Paul (R., Ky.), Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Tim Scott (R., S.C.).</p><p>Reps. Ronny Jackson (R., Texas), Mr. Trump's former White House doctor, and Lauren Boebert (R., Colo.) received donations, as did Senate candidates Rep. Mo Brooks (R., Ala.) and Herschel Walker, among others.</p><p>The committee also donated a total of $145,500 to 28 state and local races, with the largest single donation of $10,000 going to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.</p><p>share your thoughts</p><p>What do you think are Donald Trump's goals with his fundraising? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Save America PAC made a $1 million contribution last July to the Conservative Partnership Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit where former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is now a senior partner.</p><p>Outside of political and charitable contributions, the three primary Trump committees spent the most on fundraising expenses. About $8.2 million went to SMS text-messaging advertising spread across two companies, Tatango and Opn Sesame. An additional nearly $4 million was spent on WinRed donation processing fees.</p><p>The Trump political operation spent about $1.8 million on email-list rentals through the email marketing company Conservative Connector. An additional $1.5 million went to legal consulting, not including those expenses left over from 2020 recount efforts.</p><p>The Republican National Committee has been paying some of Mr. Trump's legal fees as he and his business face state and local investigations in New York and Georgia, where a grand jury was recently approved to investigate his efforts to overturn the election results.</p><p>Mr. Trump's businesses also continued to be paid by his political committees.</p><p>Save America paid a little more than $100,000 for rental and catering fees to the Trump Hotel Collection. MAGA PAC reported paying rent or meeting expenses in the amount of $188,000 to Trump Tower Commercial, $53,000 to the Mar-a-Lago Club and $3,000 to Trump Restaurants.</p><p>Anthony DeBarros contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Chad Day at Chad.Day@wsj.com</p><p>Trump Reports $122 Million Political War Chest as He Weighs 2024 Bid</p>",
