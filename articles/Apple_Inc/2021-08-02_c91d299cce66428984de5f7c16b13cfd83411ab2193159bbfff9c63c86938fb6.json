  "text": "<p>Some of that money came in the form of transfers of donations raised last year, the filings show, a caveat first reported by the New York Times and not mentioned in a statement released by Save America PAC announcing the figure.</p><p>Trump aides didn't respond to a question about the accounting.</p><p>It is early in the midterm election cycle, and committees often wait to give to candidates until closer to the start of voting. Mr. Trump's committees, which can donate $5,000 per election to a campaign, reported no donations to GOP campaigns through June 30.</p><p>The fundraising figures show that even after losing the 2020 election and being banned from multiple social-media platforms, Mr. Trump remains a draw for donations from Republican voters, particularly through email and text-message solicitations.</p><p>He has asserted his leadership over the party by summoning candidates for endorsements and repeatedly teasing a possible presidential campaign in 2024, holding back a crop of would-be candidates that includes prominent senators and former Trump administration members. Democrats have thin advantages in the Senate and House.</p><p>Mr. Trump was particularly successful on the Republican donation platform WinRed. The platform's public filing Friday showed Mr. Trump's committees raised more than $56 million in online donations -- more than any other GOP group on the platform during the first half of the year.</p><p>Some of that went to the Republican National Committee as part of a joint fundraising agreement with the Trump Make America Great Again committee. But the majority went to committees controlled by Mr. Trump -- Save America PAC, his joint fundraising committees and MAGA PAC, his former campaign that has been converted into a multicandidate committee.</p><p>In a statement Saturday night, Mr. Trump said he \"can't imagine a more important time to elect good Republicans to the House and Senate. Commonsense conservatives were never more badly needed.\"</p>",
