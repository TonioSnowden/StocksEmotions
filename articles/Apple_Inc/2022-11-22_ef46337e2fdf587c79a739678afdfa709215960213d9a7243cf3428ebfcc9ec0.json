  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Personal Technology:  Wearable Tech to Help You  Get Pregnant or Prevent It  ----  By Nicole Nguyen",
  "text": "<p>\n  Trying to have a baby? Trying not to have a baby? There's now a smartwatch for that -- and a smart ring, too. </p><p>\n  The new Apple Watch Series 8 ($399 and up) and Ultra ($799), as well as the third-generation Oura ring ($299 and up), are modernizing the age-old practice of fertility tracking with advanced temperature sensors. Their accompanying software can detect slight rises in temperature to determine your ovulation, which typically causes an upswing of 0.5 to 1 degree Fahrenheit. This is the time of month you're most likely to get pregnant. </p><p>\n  For the past few months, I've been testing the new Apple Watch and Oura. I compared the high-tech approaches with the traditional method of using a thermometer and manually charting the readings. Other wearables that take temperature readings haven't integrated them into fertility tracking yet. And specialized fertility products such as the Ava bracelet and Daysy thermometer can be useful, but my focus was on full-featured wearables. </p><p>\n  On the subject of birth control, Apple doesn't recommend using its watch for contraception purposes, but the Oura ring, when paired with the Natural Cycles app, has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration as a method to prevent pregnancies. </p><p>\n  Letting an algorithm do the work was much easier than interpreting data on my own, but that convenience comes with a cost. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Why track ovulation and temperature? </p><p>\n  Your fertile window typically includes ovulation and the five days leading up to it, according to Priyanka Ghosh, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. </p><p>\n  After ovulation, your body temperature rises and can stay elevated for several days, said Dr. Ghosh. You can use a basal thermometer, or wear a gadget, to track this change. </p><p>\n  Neither the Apple Watch nor the Oura can tell if you're running a 101-degree fever like a traditional thermometer. Instead, the devices track changes in skin temperature from your baseline, recorded while you sleep. </p><p>\n  The Apple Watch and Oura algorithms look for a temperature shift specifically to estimate which day in your cycle you ovulated. A temperature increase could, of course, also indicate illness or exercise strain. The companies say their software knows the difference. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Testing the algorithms </p><p>\n   The first day of your cycle and ovulation are closely tied. So, in addition to wearing the gadget, you need to log when you get your period (marking the start of a new cycle) in the Apple Health or Natural Cycles apps. Both take steps to protect your privacy, but to different degrees (more on that later). They use self-reported menstrual-cycle data, including past cycles you've recorded, to estimate your fertility. Temperature data from the wearables makes these calculations more accurate. </p><p>\n  If you have irregular cycles (shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days), these apps' predictions aren't as helpful -- though just keeping track can be valuable. Irregularity or lack of ovulation could indicate an underlying medical condition, Dr. Ghosh said. \"If there's any concern, seek a professional opinion,\" she said. </p><p>\n  Fertility tracking with Oura requires an Oura membership ($6 a month), plus an integration with Natural Cycles ($100 annually or $13 a month). The Apple Health app is included with iPhones and Apple Watches at no extra cost. </p><p>\n  A key difference between Natural Cycles and Apple Health is how they make inferences about your fertility. Natural Cycles predicts your specific ovulation date, then confirms when you actually did ovulate, based on temperature data from Oura. </p><p>\n  Apple doesn't predict a specific date. Instead, it predicts your next period and then subtracts 13 days to calculate your fertile window, or the six days you're most likely to conceive. But then it similarly uses temperature data to look back and confirm the specific ovulation date. </p><p>\n  Apple and Natural Cycles recommend wearing the devices every night for the most accurate results, though you can miss a day or two. You need to wear the gadgets for a few cycles to establish your body's baseline temperature, before they can confirm ovulation. </p><p>\n  For the traditional method, I logged my daily readings from a $14 drugstore basal thermometer, which is more precise because it shows two decimal points. I used a simple chart from my doctor, and marked down my temperature before I got up from bed. To fine-tune my estimate, I also took at-home tests to detect hormones that surge a day or two before ovulation. </p><p>\n  During my first cycle testing these methods, I got the flu, which might have affected my temperature. Still, the ovulation estimates from Apple Health and Natural Cycles differed by only one day. In the second cycle, Apple Health and Natural Cycles estimated the same date. The results lined up with both the hormone testing and my manual chart calculations. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Watch vs. ring: How to choose </p><p>\n  Apple and Natural Cycles algorithms were largely in agreement. But that's where the similarities end. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Comfort: I didn't like wearing the bulky Apple Watch Ultra at night. The Series 8 is sleeker and lighter, but the Ultra's multiday battery life is better for sleep tracking. The Oura ring was more comfortable, overall. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- App: In Apple's Health app, you can see a cycle log and some insights, but it's difficult to compare current cycles with past cycles. Wrist-temperature information isn't available on the watch, only the iPhone app, where it's buried under multiple menus. Frustratingly, you can see only 14 days of data at a time, rather than a snapshot of your entire cycle. </p><p>\n  The Natural Cycles app provides more context, including your typical ovulation day and variation between cycles. You can switch to a plan-pregnancy mode to view a more precise fertile window, rather than the more conservative one shown in birth-control mode that marks more potential fertile days to better prevent pregnancy. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Cost: Obviously, pen and paper were the cheapest, but also the hardest and most likely to cause errors. On several occasions, I got up to use the bathroom before taking my temperature, which is a no-no for the method. </p><p>\n  For people who already have one of the new Apple Watch models, temperature-enhanced fertility tracking in Apple Health is something free to try. But I wouldn't upgrade to an Apple Watch Series 8 or Ultra just for this. </p><p>\n  Oura, because it requires the initial purchase plus two subscriptions, can end up being the costliest. Fortunately, a Natural Cycles spokeswoman said, as a registered medical application, the app's subscription fees can be covered by both flexible spending and health spending accounts. </p><p>\n  Natural Cycles Chief Executive Elina Berglund said the company is working on its own wearable and conducting clinical trials on other third-party hardware. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Privacy: The data practices of fertility-tracking apps took on new importance after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Apple's Health app is one of the most private, with full end-to-end encryption. That means your health data can't be shared with anyone, even Apple, unless you use the export function to share your information with a doctor. </p><p>\n  Natural Cycles encrypts user data, but not end-to-end, so it could technically read your data. The company says that its subscription model means it doesn't share or sell personal health data to advertisers. It does, however, use anonymized device and IP-address data for marketing, and gives users the ability to opt out. The company is launching an anonymous mode early next year. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Worth it?  These devices can take a lot of the guesswork out of cycle tracking -- and can become even more accurate when paired with tools such as ovulation hormone tests. Choose the wearable you're most likely to be comfortable with overnight. Just remember: This technology provides an assessment and can't replace the advice or guidance of a doctor. </p><p></p>",
