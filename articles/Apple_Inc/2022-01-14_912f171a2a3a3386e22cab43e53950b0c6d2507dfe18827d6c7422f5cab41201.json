In defiance, I had it repainted in a glorious shade of American red — “Kandy Apple Red”, an iridescent riot of colour.</p> <p>The shade I chose matched the colour of a pair of crimson cord trousers that I had bought earlier, in a first attempt to lighten my spirits.</p> <p>I urge Spero to return colour to his wardrobe. The knock-on effects are glorious.</p> <p><strong>Jerry Blackett<br></strong><em>Solihull, West Midlands, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Repainting the Jag is a way to beat the lockdown blues' FT.com 14 January.
