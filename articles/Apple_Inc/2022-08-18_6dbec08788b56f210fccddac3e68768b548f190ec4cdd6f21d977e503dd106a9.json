  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>: Billionaire <strong>Jim Ratcliffe</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aae4029a-7f28-4b6f-92ae-20d41fad7ae8\">has declared his interest</a> in buying English football club<strong> Manchester United</strong> if its controlling owners, <strong>the Glazers</strong>, are open to a sale.</p> <p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Goldman struggles to diversify&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Junk bonds are coming back</p></li> </ul> <h1>Solomon plays the same old song</h1> <p>When <strong>David Solomon </strong>took up residency at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> four years ago, the banker-slash-DJ promised a new spin on the Wall Street investment bank that has lagged behind big US rivals on a key valuation measure, its price to book value, and struggled to shake its macho “masters of the universe” reputation.</p> <p>The<strong> Bear Stearns</strong> alum's mission was to develop new income streams and “drive more durable revenue”, ploughing billions of dollars into consumer banking, asset management and transaction services.</p> <p>But DJ D-Sol's Goldman remix <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30c61d67-8af9-474e-872a-b0c75258a781\">sounds remarkably like the original</a>, the FT's Joshua Franklin details.</p> <p>Solomon has cultivated more of a cool-guy image than his predecessor <strong>Lloyd Blankfein</strong>, who in 2011 <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/business/lloyd-blankfein-2011-8/\">told New York Magazine</a> that he would've liked to be a nerd in high school, but “didn't even make it to that”, before excitedly showing off his ability to pronounce “fitty cent”.</p> <p>The shinier Goldman boasts two Gulfstream jets, a partnership with<strong> McLaren</strong>'s<strong> Formula 1 </strong>team and consumer lending ventures with <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>General Motors</strong>. Not to mention a whole lot more publicity from Solomon's DJ performances, TV appearances, and even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfdDQGMIngo\">remixing a <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> track</a>.</p> <p>Beneath its modernised exterior, however, the bank's revenue streams look largely the same as they did under Blankfein.</p> <p>Trading and investment banking still make up the lion's share of the bank's revenues, while Goldman is yet to say when online consumer bank <strong>Marcus</strong> ⁠ — one of its biggest initiatives in decades ⁠ — will turn a profit. People familiar with the matter say management is conducting a review of the division's spending plans.</p> <p>The unit has cycled through three leaders in a year and a half. Its boss<strong> Peeyush Nahar</strong> must now reckon with an investigation by the US consumer finance regulator into how Marcus manages accounts in its credit card business.</p> <p>Solomon still hasn't given up on Goldman's tech ambitions, though, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36d5eb1d-e140-473c-8e3a-478470200a80\">bringing in</a> senior <strong>Google </strong>executive <strong>Jared Cohen </strong>to co-head its newly created innovation group and engaging in discussions with Apple about playing a role in a possible expansion of its buy now, pay later services, according to one person familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Analysts aren't convinced the tech expansion will be enough to hedge against its investment banking and global markets businesses, which showered Goldman in an embarrassment of fees over the past two years' dealmaking boom but now threaten to leave it high and dry.</p> <p>Factor in inflation, a looming global recession, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b22a85ae-3d44-499c-a603-250ecb1158ef\">its nightmare</a> offloading debt to back the £10bn takeover of grocer<strong> Wm Morrison</strong>, and Goldman is having a difficult moment.</p> <p>Dealmaking could be the answer, should Solomon build on the momentum of Goldman's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd064398-2030-4260-84e3-f442d42cd2d1\">€1.6bn purchase</a> of the investment management arm of Dutch insurer <strong>NN Group</strong> last year and target more steady, fee-generating businesses.</p> <p>But markets aren't exactly ripe for acquisitions, nor does its limited experience in pulling off big transactions make for a quick transition from adviser to advisee.</p> <p>Solomon must now decide whether his power is best wielded as a tech boss, a dealmaker, or some combination of the two.</p> <p>For now, he seems to be simply enjoying the life of a multihyphenate CEO, finding time to perform at Chicago's Lollapalooza festival while running a Wall Street behemoth. Goldman declined to comment on whether Solomon took the company jet to Chicago.</p> <h1>LBO financing markets show signs of life</h1> <p>Heading into their August holidays, US bankers have reason for optimism that there could be a mammoth private equity leveraged buyout struck in 2022.</p> <p>Banks, clogged with a backlog of commitments to finance takeovers struck just before the war in Ukraine unravelled financial markets — like <strong>Elliott</strong> <strong>Management</strong> and <strong>Vista</strong> <strong>Equity</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e03aba67-b7df-487d-a33f-937b75b59b99\">$16.5bn takeover</a> of <strong>Citrix</strong> — are growing confident they can sell the debt and clear their inventory.</p> <p><strong>Bank of America</strong> has quietly begun marketing the Citrix financing along with a syndicate of other lenders, finally distributing a huge financing package that has been weighing on syndicated debt markets. </p> <p>The syndicate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3cd7b98-eec0-44b1-8060-af543ae59361\">has placed $1bn</a> of the financing with private debt shops already, DD's Eric Platt reports, while Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-16/citrix-bankers-pitch-fresh-structure-for-15-billion-buyout-debt\">reports</a> the package could even tap euro-denominated markets.</p> <p>High-yield bond markets are beginning to thaw as equities recover from a second-quarter sell-off, potentially aiding the new marketing effort. Unloading Citrix will help free banks to get the LBO market humming anew. </p> <p>In recent months, private equity buyers like <strong>Hellman &amp; Friedman</strong>, <strong>Thoma</strong> <strong>Bravo</strong>, Vista Equity and <strong>Permira</strong> have turned to private lenders to get deals done. </p> <p>A drip of software-focused deals such as the takeovers of <strong>Zendesk</strong>, <strong>Anaplan</strong> and <strong>Avalara</strong> have been financed entirely with private lenders, as DD's Antoine Gara illustrated in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aec70aab-7215-4fa7-9ee3-1224d967dc28\">Big Read</a>.</p> <p>This week, Thoma Bravo closed its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac996df1-497c-42ae-a0a6-71a7595aab4a\">$6.9bn SailPoint Technologies takeover</a>. It recently turned to private lenders to buy <strong>Ping</strong> <strong>Identity</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae3b432a-941d-4d8c-840a-b28dad34428d\">is now stalking</a> UK software company <strong>Darktrace</strong>.</p> <p>These are reasonably-sized deals, but not the mammoth LBOs that make or break the year for bankers. </p> <p>Heading into 2022, some banks and private equity groups had been hoping to get at least one $25bn LBO or corporate carve-out done. If Citrix and another Elliott-led deal <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/elliott-brookfield-near-deal-with-dissident-to-acquire-nielsen\">to acquire <strong>Nielsen</strong></a> get out the door, it may be possible to end the year on a high note.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Moderna </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08be8ddf-4841-4cfb-bcb5-a5b6e820dff4#post-e510da16-8ca3-4283-913a-66a888f8ac03\">has appointed</a> <strong>James Mock</strong>, the former chief financial officer of life sciences group <strong>PerkinElmer</strong>, as finance chief three months after the sudden departure of <strong>Jorge Gomez </strong>after only one day in the job. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Michael Moro</strong>, the chief executive of crypto broker <strong>Genesis</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4226f44-d244-4cd1-a63e-997622189187\">is leaving the company</a> as it grapples with the cost of lending $2.4bn to collapsed hedge fund <strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Mat Dunn</strong> is stepping down from his roles as chief operating officer and CFO of <strong>Asos</strong>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone </strong>has appointed<strong> Adam White</strong>, a former executive at cryptocurrency platforms <strong>Bakkt </strong>and <strong>Coinbase</strong>, as a senior adviser.</p></li>  <li><p>Consulting firm <strong>AlixPartners</strong> has promoted <strong>Dan Ritter</strong> to CFO, replacing <strong>Lisa Carnoy</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong> has hired <strong>Harsh Pais</strong> as a partner in London and head of its India corporate practice. He joins from Indian firm <strong>Trilegal</strong> in Mumbai.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>The bull is back </strong>94-year-old Henry Kaufman, the former Salomon Brothers economist once known as “Dr Doom” for his bearish stance before flipping his view, has a message for the Federal Reserve: toughen up.
