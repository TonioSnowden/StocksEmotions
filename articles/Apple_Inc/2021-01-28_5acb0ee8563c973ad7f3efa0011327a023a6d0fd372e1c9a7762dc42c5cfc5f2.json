  "title": "Apple Profit Hits Record  As Sales Pass $100 Billion  ----  By Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>    Apple Inc. finished 2020 with its most profitable quarter ever, fueled by an uptick in higher-end iPhone sales and a pandemic-induced surge in demand for its laptops and tablets. </p><p>   Altogether, the Cupertino, Calif., company generated $111.4 billion in quarterly sales, an all-time high and the first time it has exceeded $100 billion in quarterly revenue. Profit rose 29% to $28.76 billion in the three months ended in December, its fiscal first quarter. On a per-share basis, Apple said it earned $1.68, exceeding the $1.41 predicted by analysts in a FactSet survey. </p><p>   \"We could not be more optimistic,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview about the company's product lineup. </p><p>   The results arrived Wednesday during the biggest week for corporate earnings this quarter as Apple, Tesla Inc. and Facebook Inc. sought to appease investor concerns over whether their rapid growth will continue. </p><p>   Tesla posted its sixth straight quarter of profits but fell in aftermarket trading. The company offered a full-year delivery forecast that appeared less robust than analysts had expected. Facebook reported record net income but also warned that uncertainty from regulatory probes and ad-targeting limits could create business headwinds. </p><p>   Apple's increasing might came under sharp criticism Wednesday from Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who described Apple as a threat to his business. Apple didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   Apple shares rose 81% in 2020 and are up about 7% this year through Wednesday on investor enthusiasm around its latest iPhone and heightened spending on its products from consumers working, going to school and seeking entertainment while stuck at home. </p><p>   The holiday quarter is always a closely watched period for Apple, accounting for about 30% of its annual sales. This time around, however, it takes on greater emphasis with the arrival of the iPhone 12 that some analysts and investors were betting would trigger a record boom. That bet, however, was thrown into question with the spread of the coronavirus last year. </p><p>   The initial outbreak in China delayed the production of the flagship phone and pushed back its launch to October from its typical September debut. Some versions of the new phone didn't start shipping to customers until November, cutting down the number of weeks Apple typically has in the period to capture sales ahead of Christmas. </p><p>   Those delays had created some uncertainty about how strong of a period Apple could report. \"There is one school of thought that because of the delayed launch and some supply constraints, the iPhone units may be on the low side,\" said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds, which counts Apple among its largest holdings. \"Although we view this as a possibility, what we believe strongly is that the iPhone 12 will be very successful in 2021.\" </p><p>   The results were achieved despite supply-chain issues. Mr. Cook said the iPhone 12 should be in balance this quarter, while he doesn't expect iPad issues to be resolved this quarter. </p><p>   Analysts on average had predicted that revenue would rise to $102.8 billion. Apple no longer breaks out unit sales, but Mr. Cook said iPhone results were helped by the iPhone 12s. </p><p>   iPhone revenue rose 17% to $65.6 billion in the December quarter. That growth was slower than in other parts of Apple's business. Sales increases were 21% for the Mac lineup and 41% for iPads. Laptop sales were helped by the arrival of the company's new in-house chip, Mr. Cook said. </p><p></p>",
