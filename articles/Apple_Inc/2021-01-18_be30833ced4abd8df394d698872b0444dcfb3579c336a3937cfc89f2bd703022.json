The fourth quarter year-on-year growth figure was the highest of any quarter since 2018 and underlined the rapid turnround in the world's second-largest economy.</p> <p>But while China's 2020 growth will be ahead of global peers, it was still the weakest annual growth figure the country has reported for more than 40 years because of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f941520-67ad-471a-815a-d6ba649d22ed\">the contraction at the start of the year</a>. </p> <p>“China's economy seems to be firing consistently on all cylinders,” said Eswar Prasad, a China finance expert at Cornell University, who added that it was “leaving other major economies in the dust”.
