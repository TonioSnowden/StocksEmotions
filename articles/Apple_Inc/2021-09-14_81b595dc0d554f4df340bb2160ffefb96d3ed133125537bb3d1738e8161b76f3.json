  "text": "<p>\"Did you fill your water bottle?\" asked her mother, Veronica Flores, as she reminded Sara to wash it. \"Do you have your sweater, iPad and phone?\" Ms. Flores said she was nervous, too.</p><p>Monday marked the first day of school in the nation's largest school district, where hundreds of thousands of students haven't taken in-person classes since March 2020. Many students' families opted not to return to classrooms during the past school year. But they are now being required to return because New York City's public schools won't offer remote learning this fall. At the end of the past school year, about 577,000 of the city's 955,000 students were taking all of their classes remotely, according to the city's Department of Education.</p><p>Leading up to the fall semester of the last academic year, Sara said she was looking forward to studying Mandarin at the public dual-language elementary and middle school. But the pandemic forced the city's schools to close in March 2020. \"I did like staying home, but I'm excited to be around people,\" she said.</p><p>When in-person classes resumed in September 2020, Ms. Flores chose to keep her daughter enrolled in remote instruction, citing safety concerns and feeling that the sporadic opening and closing of schools due to infection rates could disrupt the flow of her daughter's routine. Ms. Flores conceded to still being nervous about the possible Covid-19 spread. \"On the subway, you probably rub up against 10 people before even getting to your destination,\" she said.</p><p>New York City had a rocky start last school year. Just before schools were set to reopen in September 2020, the teachers threatened to strike, citing shortages and concerns about the district's Covid-19 safety plans. The threat prompted the Department of Education to delay reopening school buildings for a week and a half. Mayor Bill de Blasio then closed all public schools in November after the city's coronavirus positivity rate surpassed 3%.</p><p>In December, city officials allowed elementary schools to reopen for some in-person learning, but the mayor kept middle- and high-school students remote until February and March of this year.</p><p>Parents across the city kept their children home for myriad reasons, including worries about their health and safety, commuting, and needing child care for other siblings.</p><p>\"Being in-person will be more of a culture shock than just being on the computer all day,\" Ms. Flores said.</p><p>But even as more families, politicians and educators are determined for in-person classes to return after last year's constant disruptions, the spread of the Delta variant has complicated reopenings. Ms. Flores and Sara's father also initially were apprehensive about the possible risks of getting their daughter vaccinated, but hearing positive feedback from other parents lessened those concerns.</p><p>\"I think the fear of her getting infected with Covid in school overruns my fear of the long-term effects of the vaccine,\" she said, noting that Sara is scheduled to be vaccinated Wednesday.</p><p>Department of Education officials say they have crafted \"a gold standard approach to health and safety,\" stressing that every school will have 10% of their unvaccinated school population tested twice a month. The district is operating a situation room, a central hub for principals to report positive cases. It also is performing contact tracing, and providing health and safety guidance.</p><p>If evidence of widespread transmission within a school arises, the district's situation room and the New York City health department will determine whether to close the school for 10 days.</p><p>\"This summer, we only had two buildings closed out of over 800 open,\" said DOE Chancellor Meisha Ross Porter. \"We want our babies in school and we want them there every day. And these measures have proven to keep them safe.\"</p><p>When a positive case is confirmed in a classroom, unvaccinated close contacts will quarantine for 10 calendar days. Quarantined students will continue to learn remotely. In line with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, fully vaccinated individuals won't have to quarantine even if they are a close contact unless they are symptomatic.</p><p>All staff in New York City schools are required to get at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose before Sept. 27. The requirement includes nearly 150,000 teachers, custodians and cafeteria workers. Teachers also won't be able to work from home because the district isn't offering students a remote-learning option.</p><p>Standing amid the crowd of families at the school, Ms. Flores welcomed the opportunity to get Sara closer to normalcy and the chance to take her Mandarin classes in person.</p><p>\"I told her, 'You're getting way too comfortable being a hermit. I really need you to go back to school to talk to people on the outside.' \"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
