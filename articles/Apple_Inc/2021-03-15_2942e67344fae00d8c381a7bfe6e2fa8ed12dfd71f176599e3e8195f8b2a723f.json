  "text": "<p>   The 63rd annual Grammy Awards struck an intimate tone in a difficult year, with leisurely paced live and taped performances joining moving tributes in a departure from the glossy, celebrity-fueled shows of yore. </p><p>   At Sunday evening's ceremony, Taylor Swift won the night's most coveted award, album of the year, for \"Folklore,\" becoming the first female artist to notch three such wins in her career. She joins Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon, and previously won for 2008's \"Fearless\" and 2014's \"1989.\" </p><p>   Billie Eilish, who performed at the ceremony, won record of the year. During her acceptance speech, Ms. Eilish said Houston rapper Megan Thee Stallion deserved the award over her: \"You had a year that was untoppable,\" the alternative-pop artist said. \"Can we just cheer for Megan Thee Stallion?\" </p><p>   Megan Thee Stallion picked up three awards: best new artist, best rap song and best rap performance for \"Savage,\" which features Beyonce. Beyonce, whose \"Black Parade\" won best R&amp;B performance, broke the record for total career-spanning Grammy wins for a female artist. R&amp;B singer-songwriter H.E.R. won song of the year, which recognizes songwriters and composers, for \"I Can't Breathe,\" a song about police killings of unarmed Black people. </p><p>   Pop-rock star Harry Styles, in a black leather jacket and green feather boa, kicked off the night's festivities with a performance of his hit \"Watermelon Sugar,\" before other artists. </p><p>   That was the template for the pandemic-era ceremony, where performance took place in a room with fives stages facing one another. Rock sister-trio Haim also performed. The ceremony combined live and taped performances. British pop singer Dua Lipa surprised fans with an energetic, elaborate production featuring recent hits. Taylor Swift, by contrast, used a grassy, woodland scene, including a cabin and fireflies, to convey intimacy. </p><p>   Lil Baby and Brandi Carlile also provided stirring performances. While Grammy performances can historically feel forced, this year, performances by artists such as Bad Bunny won praise from music fans and experts online. </p><p>   \"Wow, that felt exactly like I was back in the club,\" this year's host, comedian Trevor Noah from \"The Daily Show,\" said after Bad Bunny's performance. </p><p>   Earlier on Sunday, Megan Thee Stallion and  singer-songwriters Fiona Apple and the late John Prine scored wins, mostly during the pre-televised portion of the ceremony. Megan Thee Stallion is the first female rapper to win best new artist since Lauryn Hill in 1999 -- in a big moment for hip-hop and female rappers. Fiona Apple won best rock performance for her song \"Shameika\" and best alternative music album for \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters,\" one of last year's most critically praised albums. Meanwhile, John Prine won two American roots awards for his last recorded song, \"I Remember Everything,\" along with a lifetime achievement award. </p><p>   One of the biggest surprises this year was that pop-R&amp;B star The Weeknd didn't receive a single nomination despite releasing one of 2020's most praised albums, yet little-known names like British music prodigy Jacob Collier and retro-soul duo Black Pumas garnered high-profile album of the year nominations. </p><p>   The Grammys, which were originally scheduled for January, come at a difficult time for the music industry. For a year now, nearly all major concerts have been canceled or postponed -- slamming concert promoters, mothballing music venues, throwing artists in limbo and eliminating the livelihood of thousands of workers, from bartenders in clubs to festival food-truck employees. </p><p>   As vaccinations pick up, live-music executives now expect a gradual return -- with outdoor amphitheater shows in mid-summer -- but routing large tours could still prove tricky. </p><p>   There were some sound issues online in the pre-telecast portion, when many of the night's awards are doled out. This sometimes prompted moments of levity, such as when the rock band The Strokes asked \"Did we win?\" a few times after winning best rock album for their record \"The New Abnormal.\" </p><p></p>",
