  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Sony, Honda Team Up to Build EVs",
  "text": "<p>Sony was once a leader in portable devices such as the Walkman but lost its position to Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others in the smartphone age. Meanwhile, Honda has ceded ground in EVs to Tesla Inc. and even fellow legacy auto makers such as General Motors Co.</p><p>Honda's EV sales currently make up a minuscule percentage of its global total and it doesn't offer a mass-market EV model for U.S. consumers yet.</p><p>On Friday, Sony Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said his company wasn't going to miss out on what he called the next megatrend: internet-connected electric cars. Sony hopes to leverage its prowess in videogames and video content, which have driven a revival at the company in recent years.</p><p>Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe echoed Sony's concerns. \"Honda will not stand by and watch these changes happening. We want to be the one who takes the initiative in this transformation,\" he said.</p><p>Honda has already tied up with GM to build electric cars at a GM plant, one of several initiatives by the Japanese company to ease away from its traditional do-it-yourself approach to developing cars.</p><p>Mr. Mibe, who took the top job last year, has said Honda plans to end production of gasoline-engine cars by 2040.</p><p>Sony's Mr. Yoshida has expressed eagerness to get into the car business. On the ground floor of Sony headquarters in Tokyo on Friday, as he held a news conference with Mr. Mibe, was a prototype electric vehicle called the Vision-S 01.</p><p>The companies' presentation was shy on details such as how many cars they hoped to sell, what the vehicles would look like and how much they would cost. The Sony-Honda joint venture won't build its own factories, instead outsourcing production to Honda, the companies said.</p><p>Mr. Mibe said the vehicles wouldn't be Hondas. \"It's separate from Honda's brand. Regardless of this joint venture, Honda will continue its own initiatives,\" he said. The companies didn't say what brand name the joint venture's cars would carry.</p><p>Mr. Mibe said he wanted the mingling of Honda and Sony engineers to generate new ideas for Honda's main business.</p><p>Both CEOs said they hoped the joint venture would grow into a big enough company to go public in the future, and they said it might sell Sony's in-car technology to other car makers.</p><p>Sony said it would bring its expertise in electronics and online services to the partnership. The company's own prototypes have suggested that Sony sees the car as another place to enjoy entertainment such as Sony's movies or videogames. Sony suggested users could control settings in the car on their smartphones, even changing the sound of the car's engine revving up.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
