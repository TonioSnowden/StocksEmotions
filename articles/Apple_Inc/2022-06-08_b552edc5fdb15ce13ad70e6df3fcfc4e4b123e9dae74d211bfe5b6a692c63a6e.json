  "text": "<p>Crying is a vital part of Cooper Raiff's creative process. The 25-year-old film-maker says he knows he's hit on a winning stretch of dialogue when he brings himself to tears. “I'll write something and it'll make me tear up and I'm like, I can really see it,” he says, speaking on Zoom from Los Angeles. It's no different when he is on set, working as an actor and director. “Whether I'm in the scene or behind the monitor, I'm crying regardless.”</p> <p>The story of his own life so far is more likely to trigger tears of joy. Only a few years ago, Raiff was a college dropout from Dallas delivering Uber Eats while dreaming of becoming an independent film-maker like his heroes Greta Gerwig, Lena Dunham and Sofia Coppola. Now he is riding high. His second film, <em>Cha Cha Real Smooth</em>, a feelgood tear-jerker (of course), was a hit at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, awarded the Audience Award and bought by Apple for $15mn.</p> <p>A Russian doll of coming-of-age stories, it centres on Andrew (played by Raiff), a recent college graduate who is struggling to get his footing in the grown-up world. He works by day at a hot-dog counter and moonlights as a motivational dancer on the New Jersey bar mitzvah party circuit. It's at such an event that he meets Domino (Dakota Johnson), a single mother with depression who cares for her autistic daughter Lola (played by newcomer Vanessa Burghardt, who has autism). Shot through with lo-fi charm and low-key humour, <em>Cha Cha</em> marks the arrival of an auteur for generation TikTok.</p> <p>It was on Twitter that Raiff attracted the attention of the film-maker Jay Duplass, another hero who would also become his mentor. While still a student at LA's Occidental College, Raiff uploaded a short he'd shot in his dorm to YouTube, and included Duplass's handle in a tweet. “Bet you won't click on this link,” he wrote. Duplass followed up with a message to say he'd won the bet.</p> <p>Raiff's first feature, <em>Shithouse</em>, made on a $15,000 budget with money raised from friends and family, is more tender than its title might suggest. It won the Grand Jury Prize in the narrative feature competition at the South by Southwest festival in 2020, prompting a deluge of interest from producers. Duplass walked his protégé through the process of becoming the industry's next indie darling, telling him: “No one's going to be offended if you say no to their request.”</p> <p>Locked down at home in his pyjamas (it was still the early days of Covid), Raiff googled the names of the producers calling his agent and turned down those whose work didn't seem to chime with his heart-on-sleeve aesthetic, including horror heavyweight Blumhouse Productions. “My agent was like, ‘Are you kidding me?'” he recalls. “I was like, I'm going to wait.”</p> <p>He didn't wait long. He took a call from Ro Donnelly, a former Netflix executive who had recently formed a production company with actor Dakota Johnson. Raiff's “bar mitzvah movie” pitch was then nothing more than a title (a twist on the 2000 dance-floor hit “Cha Cha Slide”) and the outlines of two characters: a people-pleasing college graduate and a beguiling single mother devoted to her disabled daughter. There was no script but Raiff fudged that part, telling Donnelly and Johnson that he needed a few more days to polish the pages. </p> <p>A week later, he sent them half a script and told them the rest was coming very soon. Everybody was eager to get to work. “I had just finished my first small, small, small movie and they had just started their company. So we were both pretty hungry.”</p> <p>Contrary to the industry's prevailing hurry-up-and-wait rhythm, they were on set in Pittsburgh less than a year later. By the time of shooting, the script had evolved into a work that takes in bullying, bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse and late-stage capitalism. Given the light touch with which it addresses autism, <em>Cha Cha</em> feels like a natural coda to <em>CODA</em>, the indie film that showcased deaf actors and won this year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/865abe4f-d3f3-4861-96b5-b2a6d6253854\">Oscar for Best Picture</a>. Andrew's relationship to Lola is equal parts protective and low-key. </p> <p>His romantic relationship is with Domino, a modern-day Mrs Robinson, who benefits from Johnson's gauzy affect and French new wave bangs. “The first time I met [Johnson] in person, she describes it as I looked like I had never seen a human being before,” he says. “I was very nervous of how pretty she is in person.” But by the time they were on set, after months of Zoom collaboration, inhabiting the characters they'd developed together felt like a natural progression. “I wasn't anxious.”</p> <p>Domino was inspired by Raiff's mother, a psychologist who now looks after his younger sister, Andrea, who has holoprosencephaly, a disorder whereby the brain fails to divide into two hemispheres correctly. She is unable to walk or talk. “My mom was the inspiration for Domino,” he says. “She wakes up every morning and then just walks all the way down to Andrea's bedroom,” he says, describing his mother's unstinting devotion to her daughter's needs. “She's just meeting her exactly where she is, every single day.”</p> <p>If <em>Cha Cha</em> is in part a tribute to his mother, Raiff's next project taps into the dynamics of his other parental relationship. His father, a corporate lawyer, attended every one of Raiff's basketball games until he left for college. <em>The</em> <em>Trashers</em> is a father-son hockey movie that he describes as “aggressive and angry and violent”. But with Raiff reworking the script, it's probably safe to say it will also involve a few tears.</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from June 17</em></p><p>Source: Lauren Mechling 2022 'Film-maker Cooper Raiff on going from Uber Eats to delivering a Sundance hit' FT.com 8 June.
