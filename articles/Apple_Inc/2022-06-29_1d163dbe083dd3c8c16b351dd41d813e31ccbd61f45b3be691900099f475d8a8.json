  "text": "<p>\"This means we can focus on our most important priorities,\" a spokesman for the company said. \"This increased focus, as well our strong core business, puts us in a position to weather the broader economic uncertainty many companies are facing and continue investing in the future of AR.\"</p><p>Bloomberg News earlier reported on the layoff plans.</p><p>The Niantic announcement comes amid mounting recession fears and falling valuations for stocks that have prompted many tech companies to slow or freeze hiring, or in some cases, announce layoffs.</p><p>Big tech companies have become increasingly interested in recent years in AR, which uses screens to meld digital images with views of the real world. Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc. and others are developing headsets that use the technology, which some industry executives hope will eventually create an important new computing platform as smartphones did.</p><p>Niantic, in addition to developing AR videogames, has a platform called Lightship that helps other software companies create augmented-reality experiences. The company was initially part of Alphabet Inc.'s Google before it was spun out as an independent startup during a reorganization in 2015.</p><p>Niantic is laying off about 80 employees and the canceled projects include a game based on Hasbro Inc.'s Transformers franchise, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>\"Pokémon Go\" was one of the first videogames to use augmented reality. In the game, players use their smartphone cameras to find and capture virtual creatures. Niantic's app makes money by charging for in-app purchases that help players excel faster at the game. It remains popular today and last month it reached $6 billion in global lifetime player spending across the App Store and Google Play, according to app-analytics firm Sensor Tower Inc.</p><p>Since the release of \"Pokémon Go,\" though, Niantic hasn't produced another hit. Earlier this year, the company closed an augmented-reality Harry Potter game that launched in 2019. Niantic didn't cite a reason for the decision.</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
