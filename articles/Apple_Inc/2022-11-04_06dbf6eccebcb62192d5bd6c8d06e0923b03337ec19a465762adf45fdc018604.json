  "title": "Business News:  Saudi Fund to Build EVs  In Alliance With Foxconn  ----  By Rory Jones",
  "text": "<p>   Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund is partnering with the biggest assembler of Apple Inc. iPhones to manufacture electric vehicles, part of an effort to create an industrial sector that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hopes can diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. </p><p>   The Public Investment Fund said Thursday it entered a joint venture with Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group to establish an EV brand, called Ceer, that will license component technology from BMW to build cars. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., will develop electronics in the vehicles with \"infotainment, connectivity and autonomous driving technologies,\" the Saudi fund said in a joint statement with Foxconn. </p><p>   Ceer will develop sedans and sport-utility vehicles for the mass market, with a goal of delivering its first cars in 2025, the two sides said. </p><p>   Prince Mohammed has tasked the PIF with diversifying the Saudi economy by creating new sectors disconnected from the oil industry. The fund has invested in Lucid Group Inc., an EV maker with plans to set up a factory in the kingdom. </p><p>   The government had said it hoped Lucid would attract other industrial firms to create a domestic supply chain. So the deal with Foxconn is a coup for attempts to draw foreign companies to work in the country -- though it isn't clear whether the Taiwanese firm plans to invest its own capital in the joint venture. </p><p>   Foreign investment in Saudi Arabia has remained low in recent years, despite Prince Mohammed's efforts to restructure the kingdom's economy. International firms complained about slow payment from government contractors, retroactive tax bills and archaic bureaucracy. </p><p>   Last month, the Saudi government announced national strategies aimed at attracting billions of dollars in investments from the industrial and supply-chain sectors by offering companies massive incentives. </p><p>   Foxconn has been in discussions since last year with the Saudi government about jointly building a $9 billion multipurpose facility that could make microchips, EV components and other electronics such as displays, The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>   The PIF said Ceer would attract $150 million of foreign direct investment and potentially create up to 30,000 jobs. </p><p></p>",
