  "text": "<p>What new iPhone features would get you to upgrade? Join the conversation below.</p><p>During an event Wednesday at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Apple unveiled four new iPhone models. This year, the Mini is out, replaced by the new iPhone 14 Plus, along with the more familiar iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max options.</p><p>Apple incorporated satellite connectivity in its iPhone 14 lineup for when people need help off the grid, a feature called Emergency SOS via satellite. And its phones can now detect car crashes.</p><p>The new Pro models lose the traditional front-facing camera \"notch\" and instead gain a \"dynamic island\" panel that adjusts in size based on the notifications you're getting or what you're doing on your phone. They also get an always-on display to quickly glance at the time, date or other items.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about the new iPhone 14 models.</p><p>Shift in lineup, not pricing</p><p>Apple got rid of its smaller Mini handset—which appeared in the iPhone 12 and 13 lineups with a 5.4-inch screen. Instead, there's now a 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus. The new Plus display is the same size as the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but it has fewer features and costs $200 less, starting at $899. It's available Oct. 7.</p><p>The other three phones will be available Sept. 16, and bear the same prices as their predecessors: There's the $1,099 iPhone 14 Pro Max, the $999 iPhone 14 Pro and the $799 iPhone 14.</p><p>Before the event, some market watchers expected Apple to increase the prices for its Pro models. But the new devices come as inflation makes everything from coffee to transportation more expensive. Smartphone sales have been falling since 2017, according to market tracker IDC, except for high-end models costing $900 and up—the area where Apple's premium iPhones fall.</p><p>Because models don't change much from year to year, consumers are fixing up their older phones and holding on to them longer than in the past.</p><p>But when people upgrade, they're often opting for pricier models.</p><p>Pro cameras go big</p><p>Lately, Pro models have had three cameras on the back—wide, ultrawide and telephoto—while regular iPhones have had two (no telephoto). Last year's iPhone 13 Pro models had a macro mode in its ultrawide camera that further differentiated them.</p><p>This year's models follow that strategy, with three back camera lenses in the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, and two in the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. The 14 iPhone Pro models get a bump from 12 megapixels to 48 megapixels in the main wide lens, which should allow for more detailed images.</p><p>Apple made other improvements to all the iPhone 14 cameras, with upgraded sensors and Photonic Engine photo processing to boost detail and color in lower-light shots. A new Action mode enables smoother videos by adjusting to shakes and other motion.</p><p>The new front TrueDepth camera includes autofocus for the first time, allowing the lens to focus faster in low light and capture group shots from farther away.</p><p>The Pro models lose the big front-facing camera notch found on Apple's smartphones since the iPhone X in 2017. In its place, Apple has opted for a long oval camera cutout, giving users more screen real estate and that dynamic island window.</p><p>Screen differences, bright and dim</p><p>Another big difference between the Pros and regular models is the screen. Last year's iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max had a new \"Super Retina XDR ProMotion\" display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz (double the norm of 60Hz, or 60 refreshes a second). Increasing that rate aimed to make some on-screen motion even smoother.</p><p>The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max have similar screens, but those now have the same peak brightness as Apple's $4,999 high-end computer monitor. It also has higher outdoor brightness—Apple said the screen can be twice as bright as an iPhone 13 Pro.</p><p>The Pro models feature always-on displays. They save power by refreshing as infrequently as once a second, and dimming most of the visible area, leaving only time and other pertinent info visible at all times.</p><p>Pro chip bump, satellite for all</p><p>Last year's iPhones all came with the A15 Bionic chip, though the Pros featured slightly better graphics. This year, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus also have the A15 Bionic, while the Pro models come with the A16 Bionic chip. It's built on 4-nanometer process technology, versus 5-nanometers on the A15. While this processor bump might not matter now, it could determine how long the phone will remain useful, after iOS and app updates a few years along make use of the extra power.</p><p>Like the iPhone 13 models, the new iPhones come with 5G.</p><p>Apple also included satellite connectivity in all the iPhone 14 models for people to get help when they can't reach a regular cellular signal. The feature will first be available in the U.S. and Canada in November and will be included at no extra cost for two years. A new gyroscope and accelerometer built into the four iPhone 14 models can detect car crashes and call for help.</p><p>One element that isn't in the new iPhone 14 models in the U.S. is the removable SIM-card tray. Instead of being able to swap carriers through a physical card, the new iPhones will use virtual eSIMs.</p><p>We'll be reviewing the new iPhones soon, so stay tuned for more details.</p><p>—For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter .</p><p>Write to Shara Tibken at shara.tibken@wsj.com</p><p>How the iPhone 14, 14 Plus and 14 Pro Compare to Apple's iPhone 13 Lineup</p>",
