  "text": "<p>2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E</p><p>Starting price:&#xa0;Est. mid-$40,000 range</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;300-mile maximum range; crossover practicality; loaded with tech; optional all-wheel drive; fun to drive.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;Top trims are nearly $20,000 higher.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;A brand new crossover EV, the 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E offers loads of practicality and space, a maximum range of 300 miles, and the choice of rear- or all-wheel drive.</p><p>2022 Audi e-tron</p><p>AudiStarting price:&#xa0;$66,995</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;Zero emissions; lots of style; standard all-wheel drive.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;No higher-range option; prices can get expensive in top trims; unknown resale value.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;Sized about between the Q5 and Q7 SUVs, the 2022 Audi e-tron and e-tron Sportback are 5-passenger luxury SUVs fully powered by electricity. They provide all the luxury and technology features expected of an Audi, although the range still falls behind rivals.</p><p>Mach-E vs. e-tron: The future is now</p><p>Ford Mustang Mach-E</p><p>With Ford planning to unveil a large number of EVs in the next few years, it wanted to make a splash with the first crossover in the lineup. Hence, the Mustang name, formerly reserved for the brand's legendary sports car, has been chosen to ignite this brand's electrified future. This EV crossover is not only sporty like a Mustang coupe, but also practical, as befitting an SUV.</p><p>Check out: The 2022 Nissan Leaf vs. 2022 Mini Electric—which is better?</p><p>Four trims provide a few different ranges or levels of driving, with the base having a very usable 230 miles of range and the extended range having 300. The GT is the much sportier and quicker variant, with an estimated range of 250 miles. But 230 miles is still plenty for daily driving and even some road trips if the stops are planned carefully.</p><p>Inside, the 2022 Mach-E is innovative and modern, yet also practical, with plenty of storage options and ample space even for taller passengers. The cabin is airy and spacious. With just under 30 cubic feet of room behind the rear seats that expands to nearly 60 with them folded, the Mustang Mach-E is practical as well.</p><p>Also see:How does the Mustang Mach-E compare with the Tesla Model Y?</p><p>Among the 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E standard features are comprehensive, including FordPass Connect (allows your phone to operate as a key), a 15.5-inch infotainment screen, and Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto. Also included is Ford's CoPilot360 suite of safety tech. This includes reverse brake assist, reverse sensing, blind-spot information with cross-traffic alert, pre-collision assist, lane-keeping assist, and automatic high beams. Also available is Co-Pilot360 Active, with a semi-autonomous driving mode.</p><p>A comprehensive options list adds such things as an extended-range battery, all-wheel drive with electric motors front and rear, a 360-degree camera, and an upgrade B&amp;O audio system. Prices can climb above $60,000, but the Mach-E is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit.</p><p>Audi e-tron</p><p>Audi offers the 2022 e-tron and e-tron Sportback, the former looking roughly like a slightly larger Q5 and the latter sporting a more sloped roof. With electric motors front and rear and Audi's signature all-wheel drive, the e-tron is sure-footed and pretty quick. Boost mode in the Sport setting lifts horsepower from 355 to 402 and torque from 414 lb-ft to 490.</p><p>You might like:Yes, you can still get electric vehicle tax credits — here's a guide</p><p>In other words, it might be quiet, but it can get to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. The range is just over 220 miles, which is about similar to other electric crossovers.</p><p>Inside, the e-tron is about what you'd expect from Audi, with quality materials and exceptional build quality. Refreshingly, it does not have any of those cute quirky touches that manufacturers sometimes like to add to remind you you're in an electric vehicle.</p><p>There's plenty of seating for five, and a usable 57 cubic feet of cargo space with all seats folded, somewhat less in the Sportback. In front is a 12.3-inch driver information display along with two center touchscreens, a 10.1-inch one for infotainment, and an 8.8-inch lower unit handling climate control.</p><p>The e-tron boasts a comprehensive list of safety systems, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-departure warning. Upper trims add such things as a 360-degree camera system, a 16-speaker/705-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, and massaging front seats.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Cargo capacity; charging time; both eligible for the federal tax credit.</p><p>2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E advantages</p><p>Much lower starting price; higher MPGe; longer-range versions; storage options.</p><p>2022 Audi e-tron advantages</p><p>Base power; longer bumper-to-bumper warranty; standard AWD; two body styles.</p><p>Which one is right for me?</p><p>With an estimated starting price some $20,000 lower than the e-tron, the 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E is a great crossover for someone looking to dip their toes in the EV pool.</p><p>Also see: The all new 2022 Mercedes-EQ EQS luxury electric sedan bursts with high tech</p><p>If you have more to spend, the 2022 Audi e-tron is slick, very quick, and excellent to drive. It has the style, comfort, and features expected of a German luxury car.</p><p>Compare the specs:</p><p>2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E           2022 Audi e-tron  Popular Powertrains  Electric Motor         198 kW AC synchronous              141 and 172 kW AC 3-Phase  Horsepower             266 hp                             355 hp  Torque                 317 lb-ft                          414 lb-ft  EPA Driving Range      230 miles                          222 miles  EPA Fuel Economy       100 combined/105 city/93 hwy MPGe  78 combined/78 city/77 hwy MPGe  Level 2 Charging Time  8-9 hours                          10 hours  Battery pack           66 kWh Li-ion; 288 cells           95 kWh Li-ion; 432 cells  Also available         250/300-mile range                 n/a  Specs  Warranty               3 years/36,000 miles               4 years/50,000 miles  Battery warranty       8 years/100,000 miles              8 years/100,000 miles  NHTSA Safety Rating    n/a                                5 stars  Max Seating Capacity   5                                  5  Wheelbase              117.0 inches                       115.3 inches  Overall Length         186.0 inches                       193.0 inches  Width                  74.0 inches                        76.2 inches  Height                 63.0 inches                        65.5 inches  Turning Diameter       38.0 feet                          40.0 feet  Headroom, Front        38.8 inches                        38.1 inches  Headroom, Rear         38.2 inches                        39.0 inches  Legroom, Front         41.7 inches                        40.8 inches  Legroom, Rear          38.1 inches                        39.1 inches  Shoulder Room, Front   57.6 inches                        58.6 inches  Shoulder Room, Rear    55.9 inches                        57.2 inches  EPA Passenger Volume   101 cubic feet                     n/a  Cargo Volume           29.6/59.7 cubic feet               57.0 cubic feet</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.</p>",
