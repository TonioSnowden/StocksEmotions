  "title": "Uber Plans to Cut Costs as Investors' Tech Optimism Recedes; Ride-hailing company is expected to cut costs amid 'seismic shift' in investor sentiment, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tells employees",
  "text": "<p>\"We are serving multi-trillion dollar markets, but market size is irrelevant if it doesn't translate into profit,\" he said in an email late Sunday that talked about his recent discussions with investors. \"We need to show them the money.\"</p><p>To do so, he said, the company will reduce its marketing expenses and rein in spending on human resources. \"We will treat hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount,\" Mr. Khosrowshahi said. \"We will be even more hardcore about costs across the board.\"</p><p>Uber shares fell close to 12% Monday after CNBC first reported on the email. The shares have fallen more than 40% so far this year, outpacing the 25% decline in the Nasdaq Composite Index.</p><p>Technology companies that powered the U.S. economy during the pandemic are struggling with some of the biggest challenges they have seen in years.</p><p>Concerns about rising interest rates and the reversal of some pandemic trends that bolstered tech revenues have hit the share prices of Uber, Netflix Inc., Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Among the other issues cooling the long-hot sector: inflation, labor shortages, rising interest rates and supply-chain issues.</p><p>Amazon in late April reported the slowest quarterly revenue growth in about two decades. Meta said last week that it will slow hiring for mid- to-senior-level positions. Netflix lost subscribers during its first quarter for the first time in more than a decade and signaled that losses are set to continue. Apple cautioned that the resurgence of Covid-19 in China could hinder sales.</p><p>Uber and its rival Lyft Inc. spent big for years to gain customers and market share, amassing billions of dollars in losses along the way. Despite the losses, Uber had been one of 2019's most anticipated stock-market debuts. The result disappointed, as Wall Street was increasingly wanting to see a path to profitability.</p><p>Uber and Lyft set targets to become profitable on an adjusted basis before certain costs. They met those goals last year. Those adjustments strip the business of expenses like interest, taxes and stock-based compensation that some executives consider outside a company's fundamental operations.</p><p>In his Sunday email, Mr. Khosrowshahi said that \"the goalposts have changed.\"</p><p>Investors want to see a clearer path to profitability, he said.</p><p>\"It's clear that the market is experiencing a seismic shift, and we need to react accordingly,\" he said.</p><p>For the three months through March, Uber's net loss widened to $5.93 billion from $108 million a year earlier, driven by losses on its investments in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc. and others. The company hasn't said when it expects to post a net profit.</p><p>Uber previously said it expects to be cash-flow positive by the end of this year. If it meets that goal, it would mark the first time that the underlying business of the company generates more cash than it spends.</p><p>Other startups are making similar pledges. Home-sharing giant Airbnb Inc. said last week it expects to post its first full-year net profit this year.</p><p>Uber's core ride-hailing business was walloped by the pandemic, but its food-delivery arm benefited from people stuck at home. The company cut about a quarter of its workforce and sold businesses like its self-driving unit to ride out the pandemic.</p><p>Uber's revenue more than doubled in the March quarter, as demand for rides rebounded from the downturn caused by the Covid-19 surge late last year and the company's food-delivery business grew despite restaurant re-openings.</p><p>While delivery bookings grew 12% during the quarter, the rate of growth has fallen sharply from nearly tripling a year ago. Mr. Khosrowshahi said that delivery \"should be growing even faster.\" Investors, he said, are concerned about how the business will hold up during a recession.</p><p>Uber and Lyft are grappling with a yearlong driver shortage, which has pushed up prices for rides. Both companies say that riders are returning faster than drivers.</p><p>Uber said last week that its driver base was at a postpandemic high and it didn't need to spend heavily to boost supply. Many ride-share drivers switched to delivering food during the pandemic. Uber said that because it has a food-delivery business, it was better positioned to entice drivers to switch to ferrying customers again.</p><p>Lyft, meanwhile, said last week that it would continue investment in its platform to ensure adequate driver supply. Its increased driver spending and weaker-than-expected earnings outlook for the current quarter sent its stock tumbling last week.</p><p>Lyft stock has fallen more than 50% so far this year.</p><p>Write to Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.com and Gareth Vipers at gareth.vipers@wsj.com</p><p>Uber Plans to Cut Costs as Investors' Tech Optimism Recedes</p>",
