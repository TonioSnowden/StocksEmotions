  "text": "<p>At 11:51 a.m. Eastern, GlobalFoundries GFS shares fell and touched an intraday low of $44.50, and were last down about 3% at $45.61. Late Wednesday, the Malta, N.Y.-headquartered company priced shares at $47 apiece, the top end of its forecast range.</p><p>GlobalFoundries is a third-party silicon wafer foundry, known as a fabrication plant or “fab” in industry parlance.</p><p>Those third-party fabs like GlobalFoundries make silicon wafers for the majority of chip makers that do not have their own fabs — companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc.&#xa0;AMD,&#xa0;Apple Inc.&#xa0;AAPL&#xa0;and Nvidia Corp.&#xa0;NVDA In fact, GlobalFoundries was a spin off of AMD when the company wanted to get out of the fab business.</p><p>Read:&#xa0;GlobalFoundries IPO: 5 things to know about the chip company going public in a semiconductor shortage</p><p>GlobalFoundries distinguishes itself from other third-party fabs like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM and China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.&#xa0;CN:688981 by not being dependent upon Taiwan or China, as hostilities between the two would be a huge problem for U.S. strategic supply. Recently, China expressed dissatisfaction at President Joe Biden reasserting the U.S.'s commitment to Taiwan's defense.</p><p>The company's public debut comes at a time when the world is working its way through a global chip shortage with fabs having long customer backlogs, but when IPOs are seeing their one of their biggest markets ever in terms of proceeds.</p><p>That said, the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO is up nearly 6% year-to-date, compared with a 22% gain on the S&amp;P 500 index&#xa0;SPX,&#xa0;and a 20% gain on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index&#xa0;COMP.</p>",
