  "text": "<p>WWE's net revenue improved 27% to $333.4 million from $263.5 million last year. The company's three major revenue sources — media ($278.1 million), consumer products ($32.2 million) and live events ($23.1 million) — all were up significantly year over year.</p><p>Analysts polled by FactSet expected net earnings of 65 cents a share on revenue of $325 million.</p><p>WWE's stock rose 4.7% in after-hours trading Thursday.</p><p>The last fiscal year was a body slam for WWE. The preeminent name in the industry racked up its biggest revenue year ever ($1 billion) and most profitable ($180 million), but it came at a price: More than 100 wrestlers were let go in a steady drumbeat of job cuts during 2021 that made the year such a money-making success for Chief Executive Vince McMahon.</p><p>The quarter included a two-night version of its WrestleMania extravaganza that drew 156,352 fans at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, and the most-viewed WWE premium live event ever. \"We believe WWE offers a compelling reopening trade and that business momentum will stay elevated,\" Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey said in a note late Thursday.</p><p>Read more: Pile Driver: At age 76, Vince McMahon's finishing wrestling move is simple financial engineering</p><p>\"We are off to a strong start in 2022, highlighted by record quarterly revenue and Adjusted OIBDA,\" McMahon said, announcing the results.</p><p>In a webcastwith analysts late Thursday, WWE President Nick Khan noted the enduring appeal, and potential future growth, of live sporting events on streaming services such as Comcast Corp.'s CMCSA Peacock, a key licensing partner of WWE. He pointed to MLB games on Apple Inc.'s AAPL Apple TV+ and the NFL on Amazon.com Inc.'s AMZN Prime Video. He also indicated WWE will ramp up live events at larger venues in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>Still, the past year's cost-cutting and aftereffects of COVID have contributed to reduced TV ratings, smaller live crowds and a general malaise toward the product, argue critics of WWE and McMahon.</p><p>\"It is hard to teach an old dog [McMahon] new tricks,\" Bryan Alvarez, a former wrester and a radio host on Wrestling Observer Live, told MarketWatch. \"Vince trusts [longtime wrestlers] Randy Orton and New Day. He needs to let younger talent learn and fail. He does not have patience.\"</p><p>At the same time, WWE faces its first real competition in 20 years with the emergence of Tony Khan's All Elite Wrestling, which has become a fixture on AT&amp;T Inc.'s T cable networks TNT and TBS.</p><p>Nonetheless, WWE's stock is up 20.6% so far in 2022, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index SPX is down 13%.</p><p>WWE body-slams quarterly earnings with record revenue</p>",
