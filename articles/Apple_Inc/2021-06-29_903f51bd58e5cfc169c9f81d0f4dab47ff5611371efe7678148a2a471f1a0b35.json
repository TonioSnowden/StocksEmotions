  "text": "<p>   I wonder why John K.C. Lee, a senior Hong Kong official, would bother to write such a rationale for his and his government's actions against the Apple Daily newspaper (\"Hong Kong Defends the Arrests of Journalists,\" Letters, June 24). It only makes them look foolish. I would be embarrassed -- that is what happens when one tries to defend the indefensible. </p><p>   In his 1963 American University address, John F. Kennedy said that it would be sad to think that Soviet leaders really believed their own propaganda. Sad indeed, especially considering what Hong Kong, including its present leadership, once enjoyed, and what is being lost. Then again, one cannot rule out fear as a motivation. For Mr. Lee and those like him, another freedom that has been lost is the freedom to keep silent. </p><p>    Mitch Herring </p><p>   Rochester, N.Y. </p><p></p>",
