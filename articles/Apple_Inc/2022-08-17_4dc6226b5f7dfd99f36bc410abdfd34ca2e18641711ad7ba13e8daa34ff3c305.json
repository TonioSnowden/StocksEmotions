  "title": "U.S. Retail Spending Held Steady in July; Excluding autos and gasoline, spending rose 0.7%",
  "text": "<p>Spending at gasoline stations, which makes up about one-10th of retail outlays, fell 1.8% on the month. Vehicle sales, which make up about a fifth of retail outlays, declined 1.6%.</p><p>Gasoline prices fell steadily in July to below $4 a gallon of unleaded gasoline last week after peaking at more than $5 a gallon in mid-June. The run-up in gasoline prices started in the spring after Russia invaded Ukraine, a development that shocked world energy markets and took up a bigger share of consumer spending.</p><p>Shoppers have continued to spend despite the highest annual U.S. inflation in four decades, though they are getting less for their money because of higher prices. The retail sales figures aren't adjusted for inflation.</p><p>Retail spending has risen nearly every month this year as prices climbed for essentials like groceries, gasoline and clothing. Inflation eased slightly but remained high in July.</p><p>\"The plunge in gas prices in July was a tailwind to spending in other categories,\" said Bank of America economists in a research note, adding that clothing and restaurants are among the categories that stand to benefit.</p><p>Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Day event fell July 12-13, and the company said that customers purchased more than 300 million items during the promotion. Some of the bestselling items were premium beauty products, Apple Watches, diapers and kitchen items, according to the retailer.</p><p>Companies, meanwhile, say consumers are continuing to spend, although they remain mindful about rising prices. Walmart Inc. reported Tuesday that higher prices have led shoppers to hold back on some purchases, giving priority to lower-margin food items. Best Buy Co. last week said it is cutting jobs to lower costs, due in part to consumers shifting spending as a result of high levels of inflation.</p><p>\"We're seeing a shift to lower cost options\" like private-label goods at grocery stores, said Jonathan Silver, CEO of Affinity Solutions, a firm that aggregates consumer credit- and debit-card spending. He noted that spending at discount stores was up 17% year-over-year in July while department store sales were down 2.4%, according to Affinity data.</p><p>Rod Poole, a retiree in Hickory, N.C., who works part time as a business and logistics consultant, said high inflation has prompted his family to cut back on country-club dining to three times a month from four. They also are buying more bulk- and store-branded products such as nuts, coffee creamer and pasta. And they plan to travel in the fall rather than summer to avoid peak season prices.</p><p>\"Being mindful about expenses is more at the forefront,\" Mr. Poole said. \"Some travel expenses are just absurd right now,\" he said, adding that a hotel in Bar Harbor, Maine, he stayed in five years ago for $130 a night is now asking $280. \"And it's not a $280 a night kind of place.\"</p><p>Peter Stieglmayr, a mental-health counselor in Queens, N.Y., has started regularly making meatless meals for health reasons and because beef prices have increased. Mr. Stieglmayr and his wife recently made baked plantains with rice and beans. \"Even the cheap cuts are $7, $8,\" he said, referring to beef prices.</p><p>Retail sales make up a relatively small slice of overall consumer spending, and the report is largely centered on goods spending. The Commerce Department will release a more complete look at consumer spending at the end of the month that includes services.</p><p>The U.S. economy has contracted two consecutive quarters and recent economic figures offer a mixed picture of its performance at the start of the third quarter. The Federal Reserve is aggressively raising interest rates to bring down inflation, moves that are weighing on the housing market.</p><p>Yet the U.S. labor market added 528,000 jobs in July and recovered all the jobs it lost at the start of the pandemic. Industrial production rose 0.6% in Julyas manufacturing output picked up after two straight months of contraction, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. Consumer sentiment also improved in August, according to the University of Michigan surveys, albeit from an all-time low it hit in June.</p><p>The U.S. economy is expected to grow in the third quarter according to GDPNow, a model run by the Atlanta Fed. That would be the first quarter of annualized growth this year.</p><p>Austen Hufford contributed to this article.</p><p>U.S. Retail Spending Held Steady in July</p>",
