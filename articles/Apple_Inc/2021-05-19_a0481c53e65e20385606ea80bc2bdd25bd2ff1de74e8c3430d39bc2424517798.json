  "text": "<p>The knowingly hyperbolic claim of Apple TV Plus's new eight-part series <em>1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything, </em>should worry us no more than the title's dubious grammar. You can spend the whole time wondering if 1970, or 1968, or even 1954, might have better served the makers' thesis.</p> <p>But better by far to enjoy this beautifully crafted homage to a time when music, politics and social change entwined with a vigour and intelligence that seem long lost. The original subtitle of David Hepworth's eponymous book on which the series is based tells the story more accurately: <em>Never a Dull Moment</em>.</p> <p>Yes, the series feels a couple of episodes too long, and plays fast and loose with dates: events such as the Watergate burglary, the Manson murders and the break-up of The Beatles are covered as seminal moments, despite their falling outside the series' strict parameters. Hepworth zeroed in on 1971 on strictly musical grounds in his sparky polemic, and made a persuasive argument. The broadening of the picture cannot help but weaken the case for this particular <em>annus tumultuosus</em>.</p> <p>But the makers, including series director Asif Kapadia (<em>Senna, Amy</em>), more than make up for those quibbles with outstanding use of footage and the sharp reminiscences of those who were there. Kapadia rightly decides that actions speak louder than age-worn portraits, and the result is some often magical twinning of words and image. Audio of David Bowie's 5am set at Glastonbury, tentatively trying out an acoustic version of his new song “Changes”, floats over a ravishing shot of a Somerset sunrise. (He is applauded by roughly four people.) John Lennon's “Happy Xmas (War is Over)” finds its bitter counterpoint in napalm-scarred Vietnamese children running for their lives.&#xa0;</p> <p>Familiar stories are given fresh life: a witness to the abuse suffered by Tina Turner from her husband Ike says that the only time you could see her genuinely communicate with him was on stage. We see what she means in the hard looks exchanged between the two in performance. The acrimony was hidden in plain sight: no one was looking at Tina's eyes.</p> <p>All the rest is here, splendidly depicted: the Californian chill of the singer-songwriters, The Rolling Stones in jangled exile in the south of France, Sly Stone's drug-addled vibrancy, the abiding power of Marvin Gaye's <em>What's Going On</em>. Roughly equal time is devoted to the British and American scenes, which reveal a telling imbalance: US musicians were providing a soundtrack to racial strife, pointless war casualties and epochal social reform; the Brits took to the streets over, and wrote songs about, the obscenity trial of the underground magazine Oz.</p> <p>Bowie, rightly identified as the key artist of the decade to come, wanted a piece of the transatlantic action. Impressed by Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, he craved “the wild side of existentialist America. I thought we should have that in England. I didn't know if we had that in England.” Well, we didn't. But in November 1971 he recorded a song called&#xa0; “Ziggy Stardust”. It didn't change everything, but it changed enough.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from May 21</em></p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<p>Source: Peter Aspden 2021 'Was 1971 the most tumultuous year in music history?'
