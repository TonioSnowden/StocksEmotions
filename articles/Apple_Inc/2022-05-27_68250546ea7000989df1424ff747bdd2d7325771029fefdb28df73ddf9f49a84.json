  "title": "Broadcom Makes $61 Billion Bet",
  "text": "<p>The deal to buy VMware, announced Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported on details of the talks earlier in the week, would push Broadcom deeper into a software world populated by incumbents such as International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. as well as independent companies that specialize in niche applications.</p><p>The buy would nearly triple the size of Broadcom's software division and account for nearly 49% of the company's revenue.</p><p>Under the deal, one of the year's biggest takeovers, Broadcom is paying half cash and half stock and would assume $8 billion of VMware's debt. The deal offers a total per-share value of $138, a more than 40% premium to where VMware shares were trading before media reports of the deal last week.</p><p>The boards of both companies have approved the deal.</p><p>Michael Dell and private-equity investor Silver Lake, which own 40.2% and 10% of VMware shares outstanding, respectively, have signed support agreements to vote in favor of the transaction as long as the VMware board continues to recommend the proposed transaction.</p><p>VMware fits well with Broadcom's strategy, Mr. Tan said in a call with analysts Thursday, and had the attributes it sought in acquisitions. \"The company's an indispensable provider, mission-critical platform technology with a blue-chip customer base and an incredible innovation engine,\" he said.</p><p>Broadcom has increasingly sought to move into areas of software that are crucial for companies, said Daniel Newman, principal analyst of technology-focused advisory and analyst firm Futurum Research. \"VMware makes Broadcom more important to enterprises,\" he said.</p><p>VMware shares rose 3.2% to $124.36 on Thursday. Broadcom shares rose 3.6% to $550.66.</p><p>After a two-year run of rapid expansion, the tech industry is struggling with postpandemic turbulence in e-commerce, digital advertising, PC sales and other areas. But the enterprise-software market that Broadcom is buying its way into is shaping up to be a pocket of steady growth, even amid market uncertainty.</p><p>Research firm Gartner Inc. estimates that world-wide information-technology spending, which includes private data centers as well as the cloud, could grow by 4% annually this year to $4.4 trillion, with faster growth for cloud technologies.</p><p>Mr. Tan has turned the company into a chip powerhouse through a series of acquisitions, eventually supplying Wi-Fi chips to iPhones and networking chips to big data centers, among other products. In 2018, he began a similar approach in the software business, spending $19 billion for CA Technologies, a vendor of corporate and IT programs. The following year, he bought the corporate cybersecurity business of Symantec for $10.7 billion.</p><p>The goal: find companies with deep links into large corporations' information-technology setups that would be difficult for them to abandon. Then cut costs and get the most out of their products by \"cross-selling and up-selling\" them, as Broadcom's head of software, Tom Krause, described the strategy in November.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Krause said Broadcom would focus on growing VMware's recurring revenue streams and combining it with other software investments.</p><p>\"We're focused more on taking the businesses, which are great franchises like CA and Symantec, and rolling that in from not just a brand perspective but from an operational perspective, into a much larger game plan,\" he said.</p><p>The companies expect the deal to close during Broadcom's next fiscal year, which runs from November to October. Following the close, Broadcom shareholders will own approximately 88% of the company and current VMware shareholders will own 12%.</p><p>Despite investor and analyst skepticism at the outset, Broadcom's software strategy has been a lucrative one. In their respective January quarters, Broadcom's software division made $1.31 billion of operating income on $1.83 billion of sales. By contrast, VMware reported $783 million of operating income on $3.53 billion of sales.</p><p>VMware would expand Broadcom's footprint in data centers, where it already has a presence through its chip division. Broadcom made $1.9 billion in networking revenue in its most recent quarter -- about a third of its overall chip revenue -- which Mr. Tan attributed largely to sales to data centers.</p><p>Founded in 1998, VMware pioneered virtualization software that lets one computer operate like many smaller computers. The software became a critical component of data centers as organizations looked to squeeze more performance out of their costly servers and turned VMware into one of the hottest companies in tech at the time.</p><p>In recent years VMware shifted its cloud strategy to helping organizations run software that connects their private data centers with the cloud platforms -- a practice known as the hybrid cloud.</p><p>Its integration with the large cloud platforms has put VMware in a position to be a partner for organizations moving data from their private data centers to the cloud. VMware has also become an important player in the multicloud business, where organizations mix and match the various cloud platforms to get better pricing and service. VMware's software helps companies work across the different cloud platforms.</p><p>Broadcom's shift toward software comes after its hostile bid for mobile-phone chip maker Qualcomm Inc., a $117 billion deal that the Trump administration blocked on national-security grounds in 2018.</p><p>The VMware deal could also draw regulatory scrutiny, analysts said.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission could sue to block the deal, potentially making the case that Broadcom could use its dominance to force customers to buy its other products or pay higher prices, said Christopher Sagers, a law professor and antitrust expert at Cleveland State University.</p><p>Broadcom's past behavior can also be considered in antitrust cases, Mr. Sagers said, including a settlement with the FTC last year over allegations it monopolized the market for chips in set-top cable and internet boxes.</p><p>The FTC has shown it is willing to intervene in large tech deals. It sued to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of chip designer Arm Ltd. by chip maker Nvidia Corp. in December, and the deal subsequently was called off.</p><p>The merger agreement provides for a \"go-shop\" provision under which VMware may actively solicit other proposals during a 40-day period that ends July 5.</p><p>In tandem with the deal, Broadcom released its quarterly results, reporting earnings of $2.59 billion on $8.1 billion in sales. Both were higher than expected in a FactSet survey of analysts. The company expects $8.4 billion in sales for its current quarter, also above Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>VMware said Thursday that its sales in the April quarter rose 3% to $3.09 billion from a year ago, while earnings fell 43% to $242 million. Both were below FactSet estimates.</p>",
