  "text": "<p>Companies struggling to find workers as the US economy reopens from the worst effects of the pandemic have blamed higher unemployment benefits, limited immigration and childcare challenges. Now, some are pointing to another factor: Amazon.&#xa0;</p> <p>The ecommerce leader recruited aggressively last year,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/ar/Amazon-2020-Annual-Report.pdf\">hiring 500,000 people</a>&#xa0;worldwide to meet the demands of homebound consumers at a time when millions of workers were losing their jobs. In the US, it paid at least $15 an hour before benefits, a rate it introduced in 2018 that is double the federal minimum wage.&#xa0;</p> <p>Large employers such as&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96a52439-7813-4f7a-a4c5-88322e23a24f\">Walmart&#xa0;</a>and Target followed its lead during the pandemic, establishing a new $15 minimum hourly wage rate regardless of federal law. The hourly rate has become the minimum at the Vail ski resort in Colorado, Universal's theme park in Orlando and the Tyson Foods poultry plant in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.&#xa0;</p> <p>Dave Gitlin, chief executive of air conditioning manufacturer Carrier, told the Financial Times that he had needed to adjust pay in factories from Tennessee to Minneapolis to respond to raises from Amazon and FedEx.</p> <p>“There is absolutely an Amazon effect,” said Aaron Cheris, head of Bain &amp; Company's retail practice for the Americas. Jeff Bezos's company should not be blamed for labour shortages, he argued, but “most of my retail clients would blame them for the rising wage expectations”.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Five stories in the news</h2> <p><strong>1. Jay Powell strikes dovish tone</strong> Wall Street <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81e5bff1-5928-4485-b328-abe33376b41a\">stocks gained</a> yesterday and the Nasdaq hit a new high as the Federal Reserve chair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf74366e-c5a1-4213-acbc-50575a4273c8\">signalled a more patient approach</a> to scaling back monetary policy support in testimony before Congress. The dollar steadied as well and the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond pared back some of its previous gains as Powell spoke.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Eric Adams storms to lead in New York City mayoral race</strong> The retired black police captain, who has promised to restore order to New York City's streets, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03fe32b8-d617-43bc-9d72-635949c83860\">stormed to an early lead</a> in the city's Democratic party mayoral primary. With 90 per cent of votes counted, Adams led with nearly 31 per cent of the vote, according to the Board of Elections. But it could be weeks before a winner is crowned as the city awaits the arrival of mail ballots. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Hong Kong pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily to shut down</strong> The newspaper said its&#xa0;final edition <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1eec04cb-bc7d-497b-9c87-4518355b5fc6\">would be printed&#xa0;on Thursday</a> and its website would stop being updated from midnight the same day, delivering a hammer blow to Hong Kong's free press. Pro-Beijing legislators have also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56de7f6d-c89a-4857-b2f9-5d184fa3d096\">successfully intervened</a> for the first time in a senior judicial appointment in the city. Meanwhile, US president Joe Biden is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f906c7f7-d351-4ce8-bb40-66c792b8f12f\">pushing for high-level meetings</a> with Beijing officials after five months of pursuing a hardline stance.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Blackstone strikes $6bn US housing deal</strong> Blackstone has agreed to acquire Home Partners of America, a buyer and operator of single-family rental properties, for $6bn, a signal of confidence from the world's largest real estate manager that the US housing market boom is here to stay. Meanwhile, Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone founder, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91e17994-9095-4949-baf6-f70c3b4782b0\">the primary backer</a> of US track and field athletes hoping to compete in the Tokyo Olympics. </p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Argentina averts default in debt deal with Paris Club</strong> Argentina has reached a deal <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36392153-c1d1-40ce-82d9-840b05881bbc\">to avoid another damaging default</a> by delaying the bulk of a $2.4bn payment due to a group of wealthy countries by the end of July. Argentina now has until the end of March to reach an agreement with the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4bf33f4-b7e1-4a74-b18f-eade425604fe\">so-called Paris Club</a>&#xa0;of 22 countries, which includes the US, Germany, Japan and France.</p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The<strong> Biden administration</strong>&#xa0;admitted it&#xa0;would <a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-9ae79fec-1fc5-47f5-87b9-fc239c4b1049/2TKJ_16t3i_kS8iZc1wSQQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRitOeUP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvOWFlNzlmZWMtMWZjNS00N2Y1LTg3YjktZmMyMzljNGIxMDQ5P2VtYWlsSWQ9NjBkMjU5NmI4ODA5ZTIwMDA0ZTQxZGZmJnNlZ21lbnRJZD02MGExMjZlOC1kZjNjLWI1MjQtYzk3OS1mOTBiZGU4YTY3Y2RXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpgyqVi0mAjIlVBUhNnb3Jkb24uc21pdGhAZnQuY29tWAQAAAAA\">miss the US president's target</a>&#xa0;of vaccinating 70 per cent of American adults by July 4 just as the Delta strain risks spreading “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/730e35fd-9f9e-438b-8617-c0f1bc163fd3\">like wildfire”</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>US </strong>and some <strong>European house prices</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3082fe00-cdb7-4eb9-ab2d-2309b9848114\">set records</a> as vast fiscal and monetary stimulus helped residential property markets shrug off the pandemic.
