  "text": "<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/imac-24/\">24in Apple iMacs</a> look like something you'd find on the flight deck of a UFO – at least, one with an intergalactic interior designer onboard. In their seven delicious Fruit Gum colours (a welcome nod to the multi-hues of the original 1999 iMac) and with a ridiculously minimal profile, they are by a long chalk the most desirable desktop computers ever made.</p> <p>It's not just their beauty. The performance is also stellar. Apple has used chips by Intel for a few years, and very good&#xa0;they were too. But now it has its own processor, the M1, currently installed in 24in iMacs, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> and selected 13in MacBook Pro models. It brings a speed and fluidity that makes a noticeable difference. Everything you open with an M1-equipped device snaps into action instantly. Also, if you have particularly haphazard web browsing habits, you can have several hundred tabs&#xa0;open simultaneously. </p> <p>Thanks to the M1, along with better cameras and speakers, many everyday apps&#xa0;work perceptibly better, too. FaceTime&#xa0;on the new iMac, for instance, looks and sounds so crisp, vivid and “present” you might never want to leave home again. Which I say with heavy irony because bringing out the best desktop PC&#xa0;ever at the exact time we're all champing at the bit to travel again is not&#xa0;the&#xa0;most fortunate timing.</p> <p>That said, we are being encouraged to&#xa0;regard the iMac, the iPad Pro and the iPhone 12 as an interconnected team. They&#xa0;share the squared-off design first seen&#xa0;in the 2010 iPhone 4 and again now&#xa0;found across the iMac/iPad/iPhone triumvirate. But they also work very much&#xa0;the same as one another. An iMac now looks and is used almost exactly as if&#xa0;it's the much bigger sister of an iPad Pro&#xa0;mounted on the “floating” Magic Keyboard stand Apple released a year&#xa0;ago. In this configuration, the iPad is&#xa0;now a portable near replica of&#xa0;the iMac.
