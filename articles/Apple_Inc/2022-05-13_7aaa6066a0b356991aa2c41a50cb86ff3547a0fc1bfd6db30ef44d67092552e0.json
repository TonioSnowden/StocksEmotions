  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>One important thing to remember about our supposedly “post-Covid world” is that it is, as yet, far from being post-Covid.</p> <p>Reports from China illustrate the point, with the government announcing that it will strictly limit its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b91c64e9-d67c-46e7-8923-69de55f5c38b\">citizens going abroad</a>. This is part of increasing official efforts to combat a coronavirus outbreak that has led to weeks of city lockdowns.</p> <p>At the same time, President Xi Jinping prioritising the elimination of the virus is coming under pressure as a result of the economic strain it is causing. For example, China's main financial centre Shanghai recently imposed restrictions on non-government food deliveries in the city.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69ac0449-c6f9-4b30-a346-bd6716e735e5\">Xi's zero-Covid strategy</a> threatens to crush economic growth and pile pressure on hard-pressed businesses, with the president this year seeking an unprecedented third term in office.</p> <p>North Korea, meanwhile, has confirmed its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79fac1ec-b128-4c7f-830a-ed870cd642a9\">first coronavirus cases and death</a> since the pandemic's beginning and imposed nationwide lockdowns. The country's chief ally China has, despite its own problems, promised North Korean leader Kim Jong Un its “full support and assistance”.</p> <p>North Korea is one of only two countries that have not yet initiated a Covid-19 vaccination programme. The other is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41dec58c-3860-4ae3-86c4-716ffe85dbdd\">Eritrea</a>.</p> <p>In Europe, Russia's war in Ukraine has led to questions of who is going to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/179501fa-2bae-481b-bff4-54933eb74459\">pay for the damage</a>. At the same time, farmers in Ukraine — some of the world's most important agricultural producers — are accusing the Russian army of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d28cc77d-9de3-4988-bdba-cfab77268ea3\">plundering</a> their land.</p> <p>What are the chances, however, of the war being brought to a negotiated end? Jonathan Powell, chief executive of charity Inter Mediate, which works to resolve armed conflicts around the world, says that those chances <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/528b9bca-da9c-4ef1-a5cc-c33d045f9a64\">must be kept alive</a>.</p> <p>He criticises, for example, UK government ministers for “outcompeting each other to expand Ukrainian war aims with aggressive rhetoric”. The risk of a wider catastrophe must be managed by offering Russian president Vladimir Putin what, in ancient times, the Chinese general and philosopher Sun Tzu called a “golden bridge” to retreat over, he adds.</p> <p>US president Joe Biden has a reputation for being a first class negotiator, stretching far back in his political career to the Salt talks of the 1970s. At this dangerous moment, however, he finds himself not in a position to take the advice of former US secretary of state <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/8ee73080-6e00-4dd3-a72c-5eda436328e1\">Henry Kissinger</a> that it is unwise to be facing more than one major enemy at a time.</p> <p>While it was Kissinger who attracted China into friendly relations with the US a half-century ago, Biden finds himself assailed by a diversity of enemies, among them the relatively realigned Russia and China.</p> <p>As the FT's Ed Luce writes, reflecting the views of CIA chief William Burns, the US is facing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03860857-e160-4920-9e81-28527dda5560\">new global realignment</a>. All this, plus — in common with much of the world — inflation, too.</p> <p>Taming fast rising prices, says US Federal Reserve chief Jay Powell, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad46e534-166b-4a2f-8841-5e17e109122b\">will “include some pain”</a>. </p> <p>This may well mean global recession.

The overturning of the convictions of 13 bankers in one of the biggest financial scandals in Italian history has drawn shocked reactions from local politicians and campaigners.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2d72f42-af5f-4922-8fcb-f50a32f37afc\">UK attitudes</a> today are positive about high levels of immigration.

Local alarm has also been sparked after a decision by the Solomon Islands, which is about 2,000km to the north-east of Australia, to sign a security pact with China.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b12e7173-f9bb-42cd-9dfc-8b9e44a4cf33\">sexist comments</a> levelled at <strong>Aviva</strong> chief Amanda Blanc at the company's annual shareholder meeting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/452a9b13-26be-42c4-8ab8-64208c78d129\">should not be seen as a one-off</a>, writes Helen Thomas. Rare is the woman who has risen through the ranks in business without a few stories about feeling belittled, patronised, overlooked or excluded on account of her gender, she says.</p> <p>As gloomy economic talk threatens to revive memories of the 1970s, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a0a4565-a68d-4e70-965e-3ab3806a9439\">rock group Pink Floyd</a> are not complaining.

As one who witnessed the event, I didn't see which England player exchanged shirts at the end of the game with the Argentine star. But it was Steve Hodge who showed the enterprise to approach Maradona and ask for the shirt. Hodge played just three times for England and jobbed his way around numerous football clubs with a final brief spell at pride of London's East End, Leyton Orient. The shirt at auction made more than £7mn. A nice bit of pension. Well done, Steve.</p><p>Source: Peter Chapman 2022 'Covid lives on amid war, weak money and Joe Biden's struggles' FT.com 13 May.
