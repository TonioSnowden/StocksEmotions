  "text": "<p>Three things to start:</p> <ol>  <li><p>Vladimir Putin to the rescue? The Russian president said his country was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e06c3b5d-153d-4c86-8c49-0d5447d58e76\">ready to step in</a> and stabilise global energy prices, whipsawing European natural gas markets on Wednesday. Europeans have accused Putin of squeezing supply to help push the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline forward (a little more on that later).</p></li>  <li><p>Surging fuel prices around the world have suddenly made energy central to global financial markets again. Analysts are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b790d504-b77f-4370-81e5-5ba0d16008bc\">slashing economic growth expectations</a> for China and India on the power shortages hitting both countries. On Wall Street, meanwhile, higher prices are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacb8ad4-ac88-403e-a7e4-ae99eab73473\">fuelling inflation fears</a> and raising expectations that central banks will have to tighten monetary policy. </p></li>  <li><p>Lastly, check out the latest episode of the FT's Behind the Money podcast, where Derek Brower takes us behind the scenes of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd678864-5833-4ed8-bd56-c26dad4cbcb3\">epic climate fight</a> that saw the upstart hedge fund Engine No 1 humble the global oil major ExxonMobil.</p></li> </ol> <p>Welcome to Energy Source — and hello from Houston.</p> <p>Last week we asked you whether the blow up in global energy markets would accelerate or derail the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f2dd290-6e32-4f08-9c6b-11b7bef93ffe\">shift to cleaner fuels</a>. Opinion from ES readers leaned towards it accelerating the transition. </p> <p>That was also the consensus at this week's lively FT Energy Transition Strategies Summit, which featured US energy secretary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/16d4b2a4-c03e-4afc-a7d6-c535453e7aa6\">Jennifer Granholm</a> and a host of other leaders from industry, government and finance. If you missed it, go watch the <a href=\"https://energy.live.ft.com/\">videos</a>. </p> <p>That transition, speakers largely agreed, is well under way and is not going to be reversed. But dislocations in the market like we're seeing today also seem more likely.</p> <p>That is because there remain large gaps in the technologies and policies needed to dramatically reduce carbon-dioxide emissions as envisioned in ambitious government and corporate net zero plans.</p> <p>Batteries that can store power for long durations are needed. Costs of technologies such as green hydrogen still need to fall dramatically. To reach the necessary scale, carbon capture and storage needs a far higher carbon price than anything on offer now. Immense amounts of capital have to deployed across the clean energy landscape.</p> <p>Many still see a role for natural gas while these gaps remain, and potentially beyond. Lorenzo Simonelli, the chief executive of Baker Hughes, told me producers need to do more to strip carbon from natural gas production and burning, but the fuel still had a bright future.</p> <p>The keynote speaker for the event was Granholm, and we'll focus today's main item on what she had to say about the global energy crunch and the fate of the Biden administration's imperilled energy agenda at home.</p> <p>One big scoop: Granholm is OK with natural gas being part of the proposed Clean Electricity Performance Program.</p> <p>Thank you for reading and please do let me know what you think at <a href=\"mailto:justin.jacobs@ft.com\">justin.jacobs@ft.com</a></p> <h1>Granholm examines extraordinary measures to tackle higher energy prices</h1> <p>Jennifer Granholm, the US energy secretary, is on the hot seat. </p> <p>Surging oil, natural gas and electricity prices threaten the economies and energy security of not just the US but also its allies in Europe and around the world. </p> <p>And by the way, President Joe Biden's clean energy agenda, billed as his signature response to the “existential crisis” of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/climate-capital\">climate change</a>, hangs in the balance at home.</p> <p>Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Granholm spoke to the FT on Wednesday and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42c9f6c3-ad59-42a3-b9c2-1d79850f96af\">the interview</a> was packed with news.</p> <h2>Can natural gas be part of the CEPP? ‘Yes'</h2> <p>The energy and climate centrepiece of the Democrats' $3.5tn proposed budget reconciliation package is the Clean Electricity Performance Program — a scheme that would reward utilities for increasing their clean energy generation each year, and punish those who don't.</p> <p>Joe Manchin, one of the two holdout Democratic senators needed to vote for the reconciliation package, thinks natural gas should be included in the CEPP. That's anathema to environmentalists.</p> <p>But Granholm extended an olive branch to Manchin in her interview with the FT.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/0172455b-1ad2-44b5-80ea-34b6fbed1a00.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Would the administration accept a fossil fuel in the CEPP? “Natural gas with carbon capture — yes,” Granholm said. In fact, even coal with carbon capture would be acceptable, she said. </p> <p>It is a “silver buck shot not a silver bullet approach”, she said. “Decarbonisation is decarbonisation.”</p> <p>Despite the president now having to pare back his initial $3.5tn ambitions on the reconciliation package, Granholm is optimistic it will ultimately pass. “This is still going to be a huge investment in our nation.”</p> <h2>‘All tools are on the table'</h2> <p>The Biden administration is serious about driving down fossil fuel prices.</p> <p>As Derek and I reported on Wednesday, Granholm said that “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42c9f6c3-ad59-42a3-b9c2-1d79850f96af\">all tools</a> are on the table” as the Biden administration tries to temper a politically damaging surge in oil prices, including a potential release from the strategic petroleum reserve. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacb8ad4-ac88-403e-a7e4-ae99eab73473\">Crude prices fell</a> on Wednesday, but they remain elevated and Americans are paying more at the pump than they have since 2014 — it comes at the same time that broader inflationary pressure means Americans are paying more for pretty much everything.</p> <p>In addition to a release of government-held crude supply, Granholm also did not rule out restrictions on exports in response to the higher prices.</p> <p>“That's a tool that we have not used, but it is a tool as well,” Granholm said. “We have an inter-governmental process that is going on, and as [White House press secretary Jen Psaki] said all tools are on the table. But some are more readily available than others.”</p> <p>That last part indicates such a move is not likely soon, but it's clear the Biden administration is taking a sweeping look at what it can do to rein in fuel prices. </p> <p>The potential for an SPR release became a lot more likely after Saudi Arabia and the broader Opec+ group of suppliers rebuffed a Biden administration request to pump more crude oil on to market than it was planning. </p> <p>Granholm struck a similar all-hands-on-deck tone when it came to Europe. She acknowledged that there was little the US government could do to direct more American gas to the continent in the short run. </p> <p>But she stepped up the administration's efforts to pressure Russia to start delivering more supply to Europe.</p> <p>Granholm said there was “deep concern” about Moscow's “withholding of supplies and manipulation of the market in order to demonstrate, if you will, the indispensability of Russian gas as Germany considers its Nord Stream 2 approvals.</p> <p>“The weaponisation of energy is a serious problem. I'm not saying that that is happening right now, I am saying that we understand the concerns.” <em>(Justin Jacobs)</em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>Global energy consumption and emissions are poised for decades of more growth. Energy consumption will increase almost 50 per cent by 2050, with energy emissions growing almost 25 per cent, says the US Energy Information Administration. </p> <p>“We project that [gross domestic product] and population growth will offset near-term pandemic-related declines in energy use . . . driving increases in global energy consumption,” said EIA deputy administrator Stephen Nalley in a presentation of the latest findings of its annual <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/\">International Energy Outlook</a> report.</p> <p>Economic growth in non-OECD Asia will largely drive this demand, according to the agency. While liquid fuels will remain the primary source of energy consumption, the EIA projects renewables will not be far behind. Renewable consumption is expected to more than double in the coming decades and almost equal liquid fuels in 2050. <em>(Amanda Chu)</em></p> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Take a <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/electric-car/\">look inside</a> your electric vehicle. </p></li>  <li><p>Britain will face <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82507e8d-4d33-41ac-92c7-562d3c42fc6b\">tight electricity supplies</a> this winter, warns National Grid chief. </p></li>  <li><p>Apple manufacturers in China alert to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbdd0fb0-9ac6-47b5-ad2f-2c23e8245e92\">supply chain disruptions</a>. </p></li>  <li><p>Brazil's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26aca9bd-8bb1-412b-bd8c-fcfd84f4ac94\">agricultural sector</a> is using technology to protect the planet. </p></li>  <li><p>Three <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf630722-37e3-4644-848c-e68246798534\">climate scientists</a> have been awarded a Nobel physics prize.</p></li>  <li><p>Nestlé is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e437608e-b8b7-40e0-809d-7385a10a4be5\">capitalising on plant-based</a> diets to decarbonise its portfolio. </p></li> </ul><p>Source: Justin Jacobs, Amanda Chu, Derek Brower and Myles McCormick 2021 'US energy secretary wades into price crisis' FT.com 7 October.
