  "text": "<h2>SoftBank: whatever Son wants it to be</h2> <p>What is <strong>SoftBank</strong>? It's a question we can't escape when writing about the Japanese conglomerate led by the billionaire dealmaker <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>.</p> <p>A technology company looking to prosper in a world of connected devices, an investment group focused on accumulating assets under management, a financial engineering company that engages in absurdly complex deals — the answer varies by day.</p> <p>Among large, global publicly traded companies, DD struggles to think of another business that has changed its identity as frequently as SoftBank has over the past five years. We <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/49e2f1ee-c923-47f7-ac6d-7f8e1747305b\">even made an FT Film</a> trying to piece it all together.</p> <p>If you asked us the “What is SoftBank?” question a few years ago, we might've said it was a telecoms group benefiting from the stability of its core businesses to wager a bunch of aggressive side bets, such as its investment in the Chinese ecommerce group <strong>Alibaba</strong>.</p> <p>In addition to controlling a leading Japanese telecoms business, SoftBank also owned <strong>Sprint</strong>, a major mobile carrier in the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>It spent much of the past decade trying to combine Sprint with <strong>T-Mobile US</strong> — owned by Germany's<strong> Deutsche Telekom </strong>— before finally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80b3088c-5424-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\">clinching a deal</a> last year that left it as the junior partner in the combined group.</p> <p>SoftBank sold down some of those telecoms assets last year as market sell-offs weighed heavily on its shares, shifting investors' focus to its ability to monetise the business when things got difficult.</p> <p>But on Tuesday SoftBank wanted you to know it still remains invested in telecoms and highlighted that fact with its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6476e1b6-7dcc-4b92-8470-f99a03229502\">multipronged deal</a> with Deutsche Telekom, which includes swapping part of its T-Mobile US holding for a large stake in the German group.&#xa0;</p> <p>We won't rehash all of the details, which are in our news story. This investor presentation slide sums it up nicely:</p> <p>As our colleagues at the FT's Lex column <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/955fcb0a-435d-40d8-8f07-f861fdd4a556\">write</a>, SoftBank's legacy telecoms investments have been a key source of support for the Tokyo-based company during market troughs.&#xa0;</p> <p>So it makes sense that the Japanese group is choosing now to remind the world of its strong foothold in the sector, after its shares have dropped 35 per cent from their peak earlier this year.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The irony, of course, is that if you asked shareholders what SoftBank should be, they'd say a company that uses its growing cash pile to buy back shares. That's never really been Son's style, though, aside from last year when the onset of the pandemic almost brought the company to its knees.</p> <p>Until those buyback plans are clarified, SoftBank will continue to be weighed down by concerns over Son's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/107fe840-1874-4fb2-a70b-f2f8f1381215\">frenetic investment style</a> and the huge cloud forming over its bets on Chinese tech companies.</p> <p>By SoftBank's own description, it's a company that invests in breakthrough technology to improve the quality of life for people around the world. Is that definition likely to change by the end of next year? Absolutely.</p> <h2>Evergrande: in the red</h2> <p>When trading in bonds in China's real estate behemoth <strong>Evergrande </strong>was suspended in Shenzhen on Tuesday because the price fell so sharply, investors probably felt a strong sense of déjà vu.</p> <p>That's because precisely the same issue arose just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4e2b0be-733d-41e5-991b-a3d40e8da31b\">four days before</a> when a market panic around the property developer led to temporary bond market suspensions in both Shanghai and Shenzhen.</p> <p>And when <strong>Moody's </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae2bbe36-1e49-4a46-bc65-955bbf962e2a\">downgraded</a> the world's most indebted property developer on Tuesday, investors were reminded of two separate downgrades from the rating agencies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae65aea5-d013-46e0-b3a3-8baf86fc31b9\"><strong>Fitch</strong></a> and<strong> S&amp;P Global Ratings,</strong> among others.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f518122a-e07a-4aba-87b4-1c13bde5f162\">liquidity crisis</a> surrounding Evergrande, an emblem on international markets of both the country's vast real estate sector and the current challenges it faces, is worsening by the day.&#xa0;</p> <p>A week ago the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e870dd10-223c-411e-9e72-53c3b8e609b6\">warned it risks default</a>, outlining issues ranging from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/032a851e-ef06-4df9-91c3-e37c3c87be13\">delayed payments</a> to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7dac606-1d25-4034-99af-aafab24d5a4d\">barrage of litigation</a> that have made up an almost <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67d38171-4b7f-4ecf-adbc-7d7fc399c510\">continuous stream</a> of bad news for weeks.</p> <p>The challenge has become so acute that <strong>Hui Ka Yan</strong>, the group's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9801d522-7d89-469c-98e4-0e25229fcebc\">billionaire chair</a> and once the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8de14fa8-46d5-3f57-aea7-75655dd59d65\">richest man</a> in China, was featured chairing a conference call in a photo on the company's social media feed to reassure observers that his company would complete its real estate projects.</p> <p>The company is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a50e50e7-405e-4d66-bb62-8af02ac54aed\">rushing to sell</a> its exotic array of assets, including an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c446f877-5673-480a-a847-8f08a1da5e7d\">electric vehicle unit</a>, so that it has enough cash to continue deleveraging.</p> <p>Pressure from Beijing on Chinese property developers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c700cfea-79c7-4eff-a676-df7c194048d3\">reduce their debts</a>, which began last year amid fears that coronavirus-induced cuts in borrowing rates would encourage asset bubbles, means the problem could extend beyond Evergrande.</p> <p>Other developers came under pressure this week, including <strong>Guangzhou R&amp;F</strong>, which Moody's has also downgraded, and <strong>Fantasia Group</strong>, which was founded by the niece of the country's former vice-president <strong>Zeng Qinghong </strong>and has been buying up its own bonds after prices fell.</p> <p>In each case, given the importance of debt to China's property industry, concerns have centred around the ability to refinance. Volatility surrounding Evergrande and its spate of suspensions make that even more of a challenge than it might've already been.</p> <h2>The soon-to-be publicly listed London law firm taking bets on itself</h2> <p>Ever since <strong>Mishcon de Reya</strong> announced it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73023d4a-5d6b-4148-bbae-401615e6fb95\">planning to list</a> on the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong>, potential investors have been keeping an eye out. So the City law firm's unveiling on Wednesday of a new litigation funding unit that will enable Mishcon to take a stake in its clients' cases isn't likely to have gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Mishcon — which represented<strong> Gina Miller</strong> in her Brexit challenge and <strong>Diana, Princess of Wales</strong> in her 1996 divorce — has partnered with <strong>Harbour Litigation Funding </strong>to launch its new venture <strong>MDR Solutions I</strong>, the FT's Kate Beioley <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/7320153d-624c-4426-b024-d8d8a609cf97?\">reports</a>.</p> <p>Harbour has invested £150m in the unit, which will be used to fund cases for clients who couldn't otherwise afford to bring them or want to remove litigation risk from their balance sheet.</p> <p>Mishcon reckons it can generate healthy returns through this model. It has invested a small amount of capital and will forgo a chunk of its fees in return for a percentage of clients' winnings. But its plan to hedge the risk of losses with wins from future cases also means that its judgment on which cases to pursue has to be on point.&#xa0;</p> <p>Litigation finance — whereby a third party covers the cost of a lawsuit in return for a multiple of costs or a share of the potential winnings — has grown increasingly popular among investors seeking returns in an era of low interest rates.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mishcon isn't the first law firm to tie up with a funder — others include <strong>DLA Piper</strong> in the UK. But the practice isn't without its controversy. Case in point: the US short seller<strong> Muddy Waters</strong>' 2019 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d06665de-b9e4-11e9-96bd-8e884d3ea203\">attack</a> on <strong>Burford Capital</strong> over its accounting methods.</p> <p>Mishcon is keen to show that its experience in complex disputes will give it an edge when betting on cases. Big wins like its victory for UK businesses <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1de9114c-1feb-466e-90a3-bf927a7f4cad\">fighting for insurance payouts</a> help. But with public investors looking on, the firm will have to make sure the risks pan out.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Ford</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45dc9e63-733a-430b-9e3f-926294f93901\">has hired</a> <strong>Apple</strong> executive <strong>Doug Field </strong>to lead development of the carmaker's next generation of tech-enabled vehicles.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan</strong> has appointed <strong>Avid Larizadeh-Duggan</strong> as managing director of the Teachers' Innovation Platform, Emea, where she will target venture and growth equity investments.
