  "text": "<p>High streets, shopping centres and retail parks across England reopened their doors on Monday after more than three months of lockdown as the cold weather failed to put off the more determined shoppers.</p> <p>According to data from consultancy Springboard, footfall was down just over a tenth by 5pm in England compared with the equivalent day in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic struck.</p> <p>In Wales, where retailers also reopened on Monday, shopper numbers were down 16 per cent. Non-essential shops in Scotland and Northern Ireland remain closed.</p> <p>The footfall figure in England was a notable improvement on the 34 per cent year-on-year drop last June, when shops reopened after the first lockdown.</p> <p>Non-essential retailers in England were among a number of sectors — closed since a third lockdown was imposed in early January — that reopened on Monday. Hairdressers, gyms and beauty salons can also resume trading, while pubs and restaurants can start serving customers outdoors.</p> <p>The retail sector is hoping for a surge in spending as Britons are estimated to be on course to have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e7b5c88-937c-445f-859c-2f9653332afe\">amassed</a> an extra £180bn in their bank accounts as a result of curbs on eating out, entertainment and holidays since March 2020, when the first Covid-19 lockdown was introduced.</p> <p>There were no signs of the large crowds common on London's Oxford Street in pre-pandemic times, but a select few outlets were targeted by early risers.</p> <p>A smattering of snow was not enough to put off self-professed “sneaker head” Dardan Smith, aged 20, as he stood in a queue for Nike Town that he had joined at 8am, three hours before the doors were due to open.</p> <p>“I've saved loads over lockdown and if I see more stuff I like then yeah, I'll keep shopping,”&#xa0;he said, adding that the trainers he was after can be almost twice as expensive online.</p> <p>Tanaka Mhakayakora and Jesiah Green, both 20, had already visited Westfield shopping centre in west London before arriving on Oxford Street and said falling coronavirus-related hospital admissions had reassured them about going shopping.</p> <p>“Everyone's masked up, looking sensible,” said Green. “The vaccines are out, which makes me feel confident.”&#xa0;</p> <p>By the start of trading, just 20 people were waiting outside H&amp;M and a handful outside the Apple store nearby.&#xa0;There was a bigger queue at discount fashion store Primark but Murad, a security guard who did not want to give his surname, said he had “been expecting more, to be honest”.</p> <p>Among the luxury outlets on New Bond Street, there were just two people waiting behind the ruby red and gold railings set up outside jeweller Cartier.</p> <p>At Hermes, a queue of 30 had built up by midday.&#xa0;Next door, there was a similar-sized line of people waiting by the entrance for Louis Vuitton.</p> <p>Xio Hao, 22, said he was in the market for a new bag, and was willing to spend “about” £2,000. “After this, I'll go to Chanel, Dior and Fendi,” he added. “I'm glad to be out again.”</p> <p>Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of lobby group New West End Company, said domestic shoppers were “out in force” but that a lack of international tourists and office workers was still hurting the area. Springboard data showed footfall in the central London shopping district was more than 50 per cent below 2019 levels.</p> <p>In the Trafford Centre outside Manchester, much like in London, trainers were one of the most sought after items.</p> <p>Kian Patel, 20, had installed himself outside Selfridges at 6am. “You can get shoes in store you cannot get online. They have the latest releases,” he said.</p> <p>By opening time, 50 people were queueing outside the store and most were hoping to buy the latest Nike or Adidas shoes. Many clutched bags from JD Sports and Footlocker.&#xa0;</p> <p>But as on London's Oxford Street, the longest queues at the Trafford Centre were outside Primark, which does not sell online and has estimated that it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88bc6655-cb8b-4c7d-adda-f4156a7600f7\">lost £1.1bn of revenue</a> worldwide in the six months to the end of February.</p> <p>The chain's chief executive, Paul Marchant, said it had been “a wonderful morning so far” and that stores “have been very busy”.</p> <p>Sue Peters, 52, had travelled to the Trafford Centre from Warrington. “I like to see and touch the things I buy,” she said. “You don't know what the quality is like online.” </p> <p>But Chris Spencer, who was spinning candyfloss at a stall in the centre, was worried.&#xa0;“After the first lockdown, footfall was getting back to normal,” he said. “Then after the second it was down. I think it will be down more this time. People are getting used to online shopping.”</p> <p>A recent survey by management consultants McKinsey found that nine-tenths of those who had shopped online during the pandemic intended to continue doing so.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/2c970196-2db6-4c1d-ac7b-cea05aa8feb9.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: George Steer and Jonathan Eley in London and Andy Bounds in Manchester 2021 'Determined shoppers return to England's high streets' FT.com 12 April.
