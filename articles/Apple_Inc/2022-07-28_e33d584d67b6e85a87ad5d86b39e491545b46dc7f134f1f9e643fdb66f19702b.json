  "text": "<p>   SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. is starting to feel the sting of rising inflation and weakening demand for electronics and the chips that go inside them. </p><p>   The South Korean tech giant on Thursday reported revenue of 77.2 trillion won, or the equivalent of about $59 billion, for the three months ended June 30. That represented a 21.6% rise from the year-ago quarter but a slight pullback versus the opening three months of the year when Samsung posted record-high revenues of 77.8 trillion won. </p><p>   The results ended Samsung's streak of three consecutive quarters of record revenues initially driven by the pandemic-fueled chip boom. </p><p>   Samsung, the world's biggest maker of semiconductors, smartphones and televisions, said its net profit for the second quarter rose 15.3% from the year-ago period to 11.1 trillion won. </p><p>   The company is considered an industry bellwether as it is a major electronics maker as well as a component supplier for major tech companies such as Apple Inc. </p><p>    SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., which compete with Samsung in the memory-chip business, said in their latest earnings calls that rising inflation and concerns over a recession had affected consumer confidence recently and prompted customers -- which includes PC and smartphone manufacturers -- to start tightening costs and adjusting inventories. </p><p>   Samsung's earnings are driven primarily by memory chips. Prices of the two major types of memory -- DRAM and NAND flash -- are declining as electronics demand for PCs, smartphones and other gadgets weaken. They are each expected to fall by double-digit percentages in the coming months versus the prior year, according to forecasts from Taiwan-based TrendForce. </p><p>   For the April-June period, Samsung benefited from a strong U.S. dollar and ongoing server demand for memory, though revenue growth cooled versus prior quarters. The company's semiconductor division operating profit rose 44% from the prior year to 9.98 trillion won, while revenues increased 24% to 28.5 trillion won during the same time frame. </p><p>   The company said its mobile business took a hit from rising material and logistics costs, but revenue rose, driven by sales of premium devices. Samsung's mobile-and-networks division logged second-quarter operating profit of 2.62 trillion won, a 18.9% drop from the prior year. But revenue rose 29.4% year-over-year to 29.34 trillion won. </p><p>   Samsung is preparing to launch a new version of its flagship foldable smartphones -- the brand's priciest models -- on Aug. 10. </p><p></p>",
