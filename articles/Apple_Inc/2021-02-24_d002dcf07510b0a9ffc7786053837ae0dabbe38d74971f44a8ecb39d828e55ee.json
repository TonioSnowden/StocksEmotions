  "title": "Metro Money:  Hosts Hire Pros to Polish Their Podcasts  ----  By Anne Kadet",
  "text": "<p>   Annette Perel knows that anyone with a laptop and a microphone can produce their own podcast at home. The Manhattan doula tried a few years ago, recording a pop-culture show with her niece. It lasted four episodes. </p><p>   So last year, in launching a more ambitious effort -- an interview podcast featuring people of color working in the birthing world -- she decided to get help. </p><p>   Most weeks, she goes to Gotham Podcast Studio in Manhattan to record her hourlong \"The Clearbirth Podcast\" with a guest. The studio charges her about $400 for each episode to handle the production, recording, editing and digital distribution -- no drop in the bucket. </p><p>   Ms. Perel, who works full time running her doula business, says she'd rather invest the money than spend time producing a podcast. </p><p>   And though it's been slow to take off, getting 40 downloads an episode, the show has produced several new clients, not to mention new connections with guests. </p><p>   \"I'm talking with the people I want to meet,\" Ms. Perel says. </p><p>   Last year, the number of podcasts available online through services such as Apple Podcasts and Spotify more than doubled, to 1.7 million, according to Chartable, a Manhattan-based podcast-reach and engagement-measurement service. </p><p>   And that, in turn, has spurred huge demand for services aimed at helping ordinary people become the next Joe Rogan. </p><p>   Here in New York City, where 25% of the world's top 100 podcasts are produced, according to Chartable, fledgling hosts are ponying up for podcasting consulting and coaching services, booking sessions at podcast studios and hiring freelance editors in their efforts to break through. </p><p>   While anyone can produce a podcast at home for free, these independent creators are spending anywhere from hundreds to $1,000-plus to produce each episode. </p><p>   The market is vast because it includes, well, just about everyone with a mouth. Dan Bobkoff, an executive producer of podcasts at Axios who teaches a podcasting and storytelling intensive class at NYU's School of Professional Studies, says he's been offering the noncredit, $749 course six times a year to meet demand from people ranging from college students to retirees. </p><p>   Students have included a professor launching a science show and a dentist planning a politics podcast. </p><p>   \"I love the class because it's so diverse, in every sense of the term,\" Mr. Bobkoff says. </p><p>   Matt Peters, co-founder and co-owner of Gotham Podcast Studio, launched the business in 2017 after failing to find a place to record his own martial-arts podcast. It has since outgrown its space three times, and now has a half-dozen competitors in Manhattan. </p><p>   While it's possible to record a decent-sounding show at home with a $150 setup, it's not so easy in noisy New York City. \"That's one of the things we bank on,\" Mr. Peters says. \"In rural Idaho this wouldn't work.\" </p><p>   Basic studio time starts at $60 an hour. Mr. Peters says there currently are more than 100 podcasts recording episodes at his venue, including five fellows hosting a three-hour podcast about shoes and a Jewish nonprofit producing \"Schmaltzy,\" a food show. </p><p>   Mr. Peters also is seeing more demand for production packages, charging $1,000 an episode for a soup-to-nuts service that offers everything from guest booking to transcription. Clients include a Long Island nursing home and a motivational speaker. </p><p>   What do these people have in common? </p><p>   \"Everyone wants to make money,\" he says. </p><p>   Good luck with that! The Interactive Advertising Bureau, a digital ad-marketing industry group, projects the sector earned just under $1 billion in ad revenue last year. That works out to roughly $550 for each podcast. Most earned nothing. </p><p>   On the other hand, few of the million-plus podcasts available online represent serious efforts. Only 25% of new shows make it past the 10-episode mark, says Dave Zohrob, co-founder and CEO of Chartable. </p><p>   \"The majority are people in their basement just trying it out,\" he says. \"It's like blogs back in the day.\" </p><p>   And for those producing a quality, consistent show, the economics aren't as daunting as one might imagine. Advertising sponsors typically pay $25 to $35 for every 1,000 downloads. Assuming two ads for each episode, a solo podcaster producing a weekly show could earn a six-figure income off an audience of 50,000. </p><p>   It's also possible for a podcast with an even smaller reach to pay handsomely if it targets the right niche, says Mathew Passy, a podcast consultant based in Cherry Hill, N.J. Some of his clients, which include local financial advisers, doctors and lawyers, charge advertisers more than $500 for 1,000 downloads. </p><p>   Mr. Passy says demand for his service has exploded during the pandemic, requiring him to expand his stable of contract podcast editors from three to 10. </p><p>   Professionals needed a new way to connect with their target market after the conference scene evaporated, he says. \"And a lot of people were home and bored and needed something to do.\" </p><p>   Among his most popular offerings: A $2,500 \"Podcast Setup\" package that includes strategy sessions, assistance with music and graphics, media and technical training, equipment consulting, marketing advice and the production of a short introductory episode. Editing and production services start at $125 an episode. </p><p>   But it's certainly possible to produce a successful indy podcast entirely on your own. One of the city's longest-running examples is \"The Bowery Boys,\" a meticulously crafted, long-form New York City history show that's been running since 2007. </p><p>   Greg Young, who hosts the show with his partner Tom Meyers, says the podcast ran for nine years before he was able to quit his music industry day job and devote himself full time to the show. The hosts still record at home and handle their own production. \"What we do, technically, anyone could still do,\" Mr. Young says. </p><p>   With a typical episode getting 70,000 to 90,000 downloads, the hosts earn income off sponsorship ads and live events, along with merchandise and book sales. During the pandemic, support from listeners on Patreon, a donation platform for content creators, grew to $6,300 a month and now accounts for about half their revenue, Mr. Young says. </p><p>   They earn every penny. \"The reading and researching I love, but listening to my voice for eight hours and taking out the 'ums' -- that is the agonizing part,\" he says. </p><p>   And then there's the work of updating several social-media accounts, maintaining a website and creating special content for Patreon supporters. \"I've made it into a 40-50 hour a week job,\" Mr. Young says. </p><p>   Still interested? The odds are long, but the podcast game is still open to everyone, he says: \"You can still record something in your bathroom.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   anne.kadet@wsj.com </p><p></p>",
