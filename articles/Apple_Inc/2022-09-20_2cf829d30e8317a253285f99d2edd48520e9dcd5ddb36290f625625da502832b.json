  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Investors searching for an inflation shelter are likely to find a good one in convenience stores. </p><p>\n  Most sell fuel, and companies that own them have been outperforming other retailers in the stock market this year. They might still haveroom to run. </p><p>\n  Stock prices of Casey's General Stores and Arko Corp., owner of several chains including Apple Market and E-Z Mart, are up 9.7% and 16%, respectively, for the year to date. Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard, owner of Circle K, is up 5.7% in U.S. dollar terms. All of them are handily outperforming Dollar General and supermarket giant Kroger, which are up 4% and 4.8%, respectively. </p><p>\n  Though rising prices for everything -- including fuel -- are affecting consumers' spending habits, they don't quite curb last-minute cravings for candy bars, cigarettes or pizza. </p><p>\n  Roughly 80% of items bought at convenience stores are consumed within the hour, and two-thirds of items are consumed immediately, according to Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores. </p><p>\n  A candy bar at a convenience store isn't necessarily cheaper than at Walmart, but customers typically pick up only a handful of items per visit at the former. That shields convenience stores from price sensitivity compared with bigger-ticket retail. \"If you pass through 4% to 5% of inflation on a small item, it doesn't move the needle as much,\" said Bobby Griffin, equity analyst at Raymond James, referring to customers' perception of price. That might explain the sector's strong recession record. Investors who held on to Casey's General Stores and Alimentation Couche-Tard for three years starting at the end of 2007 would have made total returns of 48% and 53%, respectively, well outperforming Dollar General's and Walmart's 35% and 21% returns. </p><p>\n  Convenience stores have had a good run through the pandemic. Casey's same-store sales have grown every quarter since its quarter ended October 2020. At Arko, same-store sales excluding cigarettes (a declining business) have grown for every quarter since its second quarter of 2020. Both Casey's and Arko's stores are concentrated in areas with small populations, which means its customers often have fewer retail options nearby. Prepared foods, which have higher margins, have been a boon for Casey's, the fifth-largest pizza chain in the U.S. Arko has been converting some of its delis into Sbarro Pizza locations. </p><p>\n  And while convenience stores' fuel businesses don't generate the kind of margins that their in-store sales do, fuel margins have been widening lately as gasoline prices have declined. When gasoline prices fall, fuel retailers -- especially large operators -- are able to immediately reduce the cost of shipments, unlike mom-and-pop stores that take in less-frequent fuel shipments. Because mom-and-pop stores' costs don't decline as quickly, larger fuel retailers are able to reap the benefit of commanding higher retail fuel prices while paying less for it. </p><p>\n  Despite the run-up in the year to date, convenience-store stocks trade at a discount to their recent historical average. Arko's enterprise value as a multiple of forward revenue is 21% below its five-year average. On the same basis, Casey's and Alimentation Couche-Tard's multiples are 12% and 4% below their respective five-year averages. </p><p>\n  For investors still looking for defensive ideas, convenience stores still look like an easy place to go. </p><p></p>",
