No, he isn't. Not even close. &#xa0;</p> <p>SBF just went from crypto hero to zero in a matter of days after he was <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/dcea81b9-70c3-486d-9622-b9cdd84da3fc\">forced to strike a deal</a> on Tuesday to sell his digital currency exchange <strong>FTX </strong>to major rival <strong>Binance</strong> for what we believe is likely zero.</p> <p>Let's take a step back to appreciate the magnitude of what happened: FTX <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8714df8-a408-48de-a2a9-c5295332a0be\">was valued at $32bn</a> in January in a funding round led by the likes of <strong>SoftBank</strong>, <strong>Tiger Global </strong>and the <strong>Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan</strong>.</p> <p>Months later, SBF appeared to command the most powerful position not just in crypto but in the world of finance. Dressed in cargo shorts and a T-shirt he appeared onstage in the Bahamas, where his company is based, alongside <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> and <strong>Tony Blair</strong>. (Soon after, he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83bc681a-a0f9-43bb-b627-c6dacae4a0a3\">had Lunch with the FT</a>.)</p> <p>But the 30-year-old just learned an important lesson: life comes at you fast. On Monday Binance chief <strong>Changpeng “CZ” Zhao</strong> sowed a seed of doubt as to the financial viability of SBF's empire. The FTX founder responded with “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.” It turns out, it wasn't.</p> <p>“This afternoon, FTX asked for our help,” CZ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1590013613586411520\">tweeted</a> on Tuesday. “There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding [letter of intent], intending to fully acquire FTX.com.”</p> <p>It was a jaw dropping moment and sent panic through the entire crypto industry — FTX would essentially collapse without a rescue from Binance. </p> <p>“This is a historical moment . . . a bit of a ‘what the f***' moment,” said<strong> Pascal Gauthier</strong>, chief executive of digital wallet provider<strong> Ledger</strong>. “It shows that no one is too big to fail. FTX seemed untouchable.”</p> <p>Indeed it did. In a market filled with dubious figures, SBF got a level of respectability and celebrity that's usually reserved for Wall Street titans. </p> <p>It wasn't too long ago that <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> chief executive <strong>David Solomon</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53dde228-02bb-4193-b47e-0d171ae96073\">tried to woo</a> SBF during a meeting in the Caribbean.</p> <p>Even celebrities like supermodel <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong> wanted in on the action. She <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/gisele-bundchen-ftx-cyrpto-philanthropy-campaign-interview\">became</a> the face of FTX as well as its head of environmental and social initiatives, appearing in an advert alongside SBF that said “The future of investing is FTX. You in?”&#xa0;</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTX_Official/status/1589677581598871552\">https://twitter.com/FTX_Official/status/1589677581598871552 </a> <p>Well known investors such as <strong>Millennium Management</strong>'s<strong> Izzy Englander</strong>, <strong>Third Point</strong>'s <strong>Dan Loeb</strong> and private equity billionaire <strong>Orlando Bravo</strong> were.</p> <p>Until a few days ago, FTX was the paragon of stability in the crypto market and helped legitimise it as an asset class. That view was endorsed by the who's who of the investment world and now it has all come undone. The real question is what happens if the deal falls through?</p> <h1>Carlyle's botched succession came at a terrible time</h1> <p><strong>Carlyle Group</strong> entered the year on an acquisition push with its shares near record highs.</p> <p>Nine months later, the firm, founded by billionaires <strong>David</strong> <strong>Rubenstein</strong>, <strong>William</strong> <strong>Conway</strong> and <strong>Daniel</strong> <strong>D'Aniello</strong>, has to manage a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d0187d3-e0fb-4e87-bbfb-2e63f467f9f4\">fumbled succession</a> in a quickly souring market for private equity deals.</p> <p>In its first earnings report since <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b069b69f-6413-4f29-a9ff-288ac2eb690d\">former chief executive</a> <strong>Kewsong</strong> <strong>Lee</strong> resigned this summer after he was told his contract would expire at year-end, Carlyle reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3db42688-2714-4519-a17a-45e5fe6a88af\">a steep slowdown in fundraising</a> and its overall assets under management fell, DD's Antoine Gara reports.</p> <p>The $6bn in new investor commitments Carlyle drew in the third quarter was less than the $10bn it raised in the second quarter and well below the amounts gathered by US private equity rivals. <strong>Blackstone</strong> raised $45bn, <strong>Apollo</strong> <strong>Global</strong> <strong>Management</strong> raised $34bn and <strong>KKR</strong> raised $13bn this quarter.</p> <p>The fundraising slowdown masked strong investment results and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d405513-0f5f-4d3f-b66d-931b0cf3484d\">caused shares to slide close to multiyear lows</a>, Lex notes.</p> <p>Conway, who has been acting as interim chief executive since August, was peppered by analysts who asked if the leadership upheaval had affected fundraising.</p> <p>“[The] short answer would be no, in terms of the impact of the CEO change on fundraising,” Conway said. “[I] don't see any long-term damage at all in this.”</p> <p>About finding a new leader, Conway had few additional details to offer. “Before I close, let me comment on our search for a permanent CEO. In short, the search continues,” he said.</p> <p>Sources familiar with the matter say internal and external candidates remain in the mix.</p> <p>Three Carlyle business unit leaders, <strong>Mark</strong> <strong>Jenkins</strong>, head of credit; <strong>Ruulke Bagijn</strong>, head of investment solutions; and <strong>Peter</strong> <strong>Clare</strong>, a longtime partner who chairs the firm's private equity business, were on the call with shareholders. Carlyle shares fell over 7 per cent.</p> <p>Whoever Carlyle's triumvirate of founders picks has a tough challenge ahead.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Adidas</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/066855d6-3ab8-4510-bf71-48a6dd61182a\">has hired</a><strong> Puma</strong> boss and former Norwegian professional footballer <strong>Bjørn Gulden</strong> to lead the world's second-largest sportswear maker from January following three profit warnings in the past five months and the end of a lucrative tie-up with<strong> Kanye West</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>UBS</strong>'s chief risk officer, <strong>Christian Bluhm</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ddfe78b-909c-4ef4-ad6f-b23cf67e2284\">has resigned</a> from the Swiss bank to become a full-time professional photographer.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Kohl's</strong> chief executive <strong>Michelle Gass </strong>is stepping down in December to eventually become chief executive of<strong> Levi Strauss</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221108005790/en/Ancora-Issues-Statement-of-Support-Regarding-Management-Transition-at-Kohl%E2%80%99s\">following pressure</a> on the retailer from <strong>Ancora </strong>and other activist investors.</p></li>  <li><p>A group of <strong>PwC </strong>partners <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a646c94-8ea0-4bc8-83b0-0d6ab8ccefea?shareType=nongift\">has launched</a> a breakaway firm in Cyprus to take on work from Russia-linked clients that the Big Four accountants will no longer touch.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>TikTok </strong>has transferred North America general manager <strong>Sandie Hawkins</strong> to run its US ecommerce channel, according to five people with knowledge of the changes, and cut a number of senior roles, including former global head of ads business systems <strong>David Ortiz</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e70316fa-bae2-4b3a-989f-d761e078b7a0\">as part of a major US restructuring</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Hotel Qatar</strong> In Doha, hotels act as havens for sex, booze and even activism.
