  "text": "<p>\"Our team has put a lot of effort into arranging accommodation for employees and communicating with the local government,\" Mr. Liu said in an earnings call.</p><p>Apple Inc., Foxconn's biggest customer, said last month that the Covid outbreaks in China threaten to hinder sales by as much as $8 billion in the current quarter. Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple's supply constraints mainly stemmed from Shanghai, much of which has been under a lockdown for more than a month, and the nearby regions where logistics have been disrupted.</p><p>Foxconn runs Apple's biggest iPhone production site, located in China's central Henan province. There, Foxconn has been following a closed-loop system to keep tens of thousands of workers and other staff in or around the factory, a system that has become the standard among manufacturers in China in to continue manufacturing during Covid outbreaks.</p><p>In March, Foxconn had to suspend operations at its factories in Shenzhen, another site where it produces Apple products, after a Coronavirus outbreak in the southern city.</p><p>In April, the company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., posted a 2.8% drop in revenue. It expects revenue to be flat in the current quarter.</p><p>For the first quarter, Foxconn's revenue rose 4.5% from a year earlier, while net profit rose 4.6% to 29.45 billion New Taiwan dollars, or around $989.6 million.</p><p>Hit harder than Foxconn is rival Pegatron Corp., the second-largest assembler of iPhones, which suspended production at its factories in Shanghai and nearby Jiangsu province last month. This week Pegatron said its April sales declined 19% from a year ago.</p><p>On Thursday, Pegatron posted a 39.6% decline in January-March net profit from the same period a year ago, while revenue rose 49.5%.</p><p>Foxconn Faces Covid Logistics Disarray in China</p>",
