Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo asked business leaders to respond to the voluntary request for information in the next 45 days. </p><p>\n  Companies that participated include Apple Inc., Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Intel Corp., Medtronic, Samsung Electronics Co., Stellantis NV and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. </p><p>\n  The administration is also ratcheting up what it calls an early-alert system to mitigate semiconductor plant shutdowns related to the spread of Covid-19's Delta variant. U.S. diplomats to countries in Southeast Asia including Malaysia and Vietnam will be asked to work with governments to keep factories running while ensuring Covid-19-related worker protections are in place, officials said. </p><p>\n  -- Alex Leary </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  NEW YORK STATE </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Health Commissioner </p><p>\n  Zucker Is Leaving </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Howard Zucker, the commissioner of the New York State Department of Health who worked with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to guide the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic, has resigned from his position. </p><p>\n  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the resignation Thursday and said Mr. Zucker would stay on until a successor is named. Ms. Hochul succeeded Mr. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, in August after he resigned amid a sexual-harassment scandal. \"I made it very clear on my first day in office that I would be looking to build a new team,\" Ms. Hochul said. </p><p>\n  Dr. Zucker, 62, is one of several Cuomo-appointed cabinet members who have stepped down in recent weeks. In a resignation letter he said he believed the most difficult aspects of the state's pandemic response were in the past and that he felt it was a good time to pass the baton. </p><p>\n  -- Jimmy Vielkind </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  CALIFORNIA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New Fire Spreads, </p><p>\n  Prompts Evacuations </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Evacuations were ordered Thursday in a Northern California community as a new wildfire spread, authorities said. </p><p>\n  The Shasta County Sheriff's Office issued a mandatory evacuation order because of the Fawn Fire burning in the unincorporated Mountain Gate area north of the city of Redding at the far north end of the Central Valley. </p><p>\n  Residents were told to temporarily gather in a parking lot at Shasta College in Redding. People living in other areas were warned to be prepared to leave. Some 2,000 structures were threatened. The fire has grown to nearly 2 square miles since it started Wednesday afternoon and was just 5% contained. The fire was burning in heavy timber on steep, rugged terrain amid hot, dry and gusty conditions. </p><p>\n  Statewide, more than 9,000 firefighters remained assigned to 10 large, active wildfires, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. </p><p>\n  California fires have burned 3,671 square miles this year, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  LOUISIANA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Ex-Trooper Indicted </p><p>\n  For Beating Black Man </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A former Louisiana State Police trooper has been charged with a civil-rights violation for pummeling a Black motorist 18 times with a flashlight -- the first criminal case to emerge from federal investigations into troopers' beatings of at least three Black men. </p><p>\n  A grand jury on Thursday indicted Jacob Brown for the 2019 beating following a traffic stop that left Aaron Larry Bowman with a broken jaw, broken ribs and a gash to his head. Mr. Brown was charged with one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, federal prosecutors said. </p><p>\n  Mr. Brown's indictment comes as the federal prosecutors on the case are scrutinizing other troopers who punched, stunned and dragged another Black motorist, Ronald Greene, before he died in their custody on a rural roadside. </p><p>\n  Mr. Brown's attorney, Scott Wolleson, declined to comment. A state police spokesman didn't immediately respond to a text message requesting comment but previously released a statement saying Mr. Brown \"engaged in excessive and unjustifiable actions and failed to report the use of force to his supervisors.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Bowman's attorney, Donecia Banks-Miley, said: \"We're just trying to remain hopeful and trust the process of justice.\" </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
