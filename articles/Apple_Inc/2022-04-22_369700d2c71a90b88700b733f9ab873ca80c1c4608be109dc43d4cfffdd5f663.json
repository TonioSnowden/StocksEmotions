  "text": "<p>* Useful third seating row</p><p>* User-friendly infotainment system</p><p>Cons</p><p>* Underpowered engines</p><p>* No hybrid version</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* Sport trim gains Brembo brakes</p><p>* Two new paint finishes</p><p>Price: The 2022 Cadillac XT6 starts at $48,595.</p><p>The 2022 Cadillac XT6 is a luxury 3-row midsize crossover with seating for seven and ample occupant space. What the XT6 isn't is some unsung gem whose talents have been unfairly overshadowed by the big guns from Europe and Asia.</p><p>This is Cadillac's contender in a class full of superb vehicles. What stops the XT6 from making a bigger splash is the lack of anything really special beyond its exterior styling and a roomy third seating row. Yes, it's more affordable than a German rival. But other alternatives at this level are just as attractive — more so in some respects, like resale values.</p><p>How old is this generation of XT6? Not old at all. Still in its first generation, the XT6 debuted for the 2020 model year. It's built in Tennessee, along with the XT5. Does XT mean anything? Crossover Touring. We guess this one is called 6 because it's one bigger than the XT5.</p><p>2022 Cadillac XT6 pricing</p><p>The 2022 XT6 range starts with the front-drive Luxury version. It has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of $48,595, plus destination charge.</p><p>We recommend spending another $4,400 for Premium Luxury trim, not just for the V6 engine, but also for the extra equipment and the ability to select more options. Adding all-wheel drive to either of these versions costs another $2,000.</p><p>The all-wheel-drive Sport model tops the lineup at $58,295. It's easy enough to push that closer to $70K with a bunch of options.</p><p>The competition is brutal and plentiful. The Lincoln Aviator starts at $51K, the Volvo XC90 and Genesis GV80 are about $50K, and the new-for-2022 Acura MDX is closer to $47K. The 3-row Lexus RX-L costs about the same as the XT6. And we're looking at just under $60K for the Audi Q7, BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class.</p><p>Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their new XT6. Lexus tops the resale value charts; the XT6 is an average performer.</p><p>Driving the 2022 Cadillac XT6</p><p>The same 237-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that powers the base XT6 is also in the compact XT5 and it's one of the least muscular in that class. So it's borderline unsuitable for a new luxury 3-row midsize crossover. Not that the 310-horsepower V6 in the top two trims is impressive, but it's the better choice.</p><p>Sport trim makes the most of its engine by adding an adaptive suspension as standard, quicker steering, and a torque-vectoring feature in its all-wheel-drive system. What happens is that it makes the outside wheel go faster through a corner than its inside counterpart, adding to the sensations of agility and stability.</p><p>Brembo IT:BRE is an Italian company supplying braking systems to many manufacturers. If they're good enough for Ferrari RACE, they're good enough for the 2022 XT6 Sport.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>In standard form, the 2022 XT6 has seating for seven. Optional second-row captain's chairs bring that down to six. Third-row legroom of 29.5 inches is pretty good for the class. And those in the second row can still enjoy a generous 39.1 inches.</p><p>Cadillac has prioritized passenger space over luggage space. Behind the third row is a relatively small 12.6 cubic feet. With all seats in the back two rows folded, however, the XT6's 78.7 cubic feet is still impressive.</p><p>This year, the XT6 gains new color-keyed mats. Hardly the most exciting news, but we thought you'd like to know.</p><p>It's functional, quiet and kind of upscale, but ultimately the cabin of the 2022 XT6 is not particularly special.</p><p>Also see: Mortgage rates soar to highest level in over a decade — even wealthy home buyers are feeling the pain</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>At last, some Caddy swagger makes it to the 2022 XT6. The front has a corporate shield-shaped grille, flanked by thin LED headlights and unusual daytime running lights set vertically. Lighting adds some drama at the tail as well, enhanced by dual exhaust outlets on models with the V-6 engine.</p><p>Roof rails are standard; those on the Sport have a black finish. Cadillac offers a few exterior cosmetic bundles. The Radiant package brings a bright chrome finish for the grille and 20-inch alloy wheels. Onyx goes in the other direction with gloss black elements.</p><p>New paint choices this year are Latte Metallic and Rosewood Metallic.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Rear camera mirrorThis option (in the top two trims) has the appearance of a regular rearview mirror, but with the flip of a switch shows the feed from a rear-facing camera (which has its own washer). Drivers are assured a clean, clear view behind — without the image being hindered by rear pillars, rear passengers, or crammed cargo areas.</p><p>Night visionAnother extra in the top upper trims, this feature employs infrared technology to detect large animals and humans who might be around at night, but out of the headlights' range.</p><p>Don't miss: We spent over $100K trying to flip a 'nightmare' house. I want to sell, my husband wants to rent it out. Who's right?</p><p>Standard features</p><p>In the base Luxury trim, the 2022 XT6 comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights with automatic high beams, sunroof, keyless entry/ignition, remote start, 3-zone automatic climate control, heated/power-adjustable front seats with driver's-side memory settings, leather-wrapped steering wheel, self-dimming rearview mirror, and a powered tailgate.</p><p>The infotainment system has an 8-inch touchscreen, satellite radio, wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, Wi-Fi, two USB-A ports, four USB-C ports, natural voice recognition, and a Bose 8-speaker audio setup.</p><p>On the protection front, the 2022 Cadillac XT6 comes standard with the Smart System set of safety features, including forward-collision alert with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, and Safety Alert Seat that vibrates when potential hazards are approaching either side.</p><p>Smart System also includes blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, front/rear parking sensors, Teen Driver (which lets parents set various parameters, such as maximum stereo volume, for novice drivers, and a rear-seat reminder that alerts the driver if there might be a child (or a pet) left in the back seat of this large Cadillac SUV.</p><p>Factory options</p><p>Premium Luxury adds the V-6 engine, 20-inch alloy wheels, heated/power-adjustable steering wheel, wireless phone charging, rain-sensing wipers, alarm, and hands-free tailgate operation. It's also eligible for the Sport version's adaptive suspension.</p><p>This year, Sport trim gains Brembo brakes with red-painted calipers to complement the already standard adaptive sport suspension and all-wheel drive.</p><p>Luxury trim is offered with all-wheel drive, 19-inch or 20-inch alloy wheels, and a choice of exterior cosmetics packages. But the majority of desirable extras are reserved for the top two trims.</p><p>These include captain's chairs for the second row, adaptive cruise control, heated/ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, 14-speaker Bose audio, 8-inch digital driver display, 360-degree camera system, self-parking feature, rear camera mirror, night vision, and semi-aniline leather upholstery.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch: I'll have $5 million for retirement when I sell my dental practice next year — but my wife and kids don't want me to retire</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>The base engine propelling the 2022 XT6 in Luxury trim is a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder unit making 237 horsepower on premium gasoline. A 9-speed automatic transmission sends that to the front wheels (FWD) in standard form, or to an optional all-wheel-drive (AWD) system.</p><p>Premium Luxury and Sport trims both have a 310-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 linked to a 9-speed automatic transmission, and Sport trim has all-wheel drive as standard.</p><p>Both engines have a stop/restart function to save fuel while idling. The 4-cylinder engine's towing capacity is just 1,000 pounds. Versions with the V6 are rated at 4,000 pounds.</p><p>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Luxury)237 horsepower @ 5,000 rpm258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500-4,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/27 mpg (FWD), 21/26 mpg (AWD)</p><p>3.6-liter V6 (Premium Luxury, Sport)310 horsepower @ 6,600 rpm271 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/26 mpg (FWD), 18/25 mpg (AWD)</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com .</p><p>If you're looking for Caddy swagger, look no further than the 2022 Cadillac XT6</p>",
