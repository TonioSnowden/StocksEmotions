  "title": "Apple Loses Another Design Leader; The iPhone maker said Evans Hankey is leaving the company, the latest departure from the team responsible for the look and feel of its popular consumer products",
  "text": "<p>An Apple spokesman said the company is well equipped to continue onward without Ms. Hankey, who will temporarily stick around as it works through the change in leadership.</p><p>\"The senior design team has strong leaders with decades of experience,\" the spokesman said. Bloomberg earlier reported the news of Ms. Hankey's departure.</p><p>Apple has seen turnover in recent years in the department, which has been known internally as ID. Around the time of Mr. Ive's resignation, seasoned Apple design executives Rico Zorkendorfer, Daniele De Iuliis and Julian HÃ¶nig also left the company. The group played a key role in resurrecting Apple's business after co-founder Steve Jobs returned in 1997 and was behind the design of the candy-colored iMac, followed by a string of other design hits.</p><p>Apple last quarter reported a nearly 11% decline in profit, marking its worst quarter since the July-through-September period in 2020 ahead of the 5G-capable-iPhone launch. The company cited supply constraints and shutdowns in China for the loss, and said iPhone sales continued to grow. It reports for the September-ended quarter next week.</p><p>In the computer market, Applehas been faring better than its peers. Its desktop and laptop shipments rose 2% in the third quarter, according to Canalys Inc., while other PC makers, including Dell, HP and Lenovo, saw significant declines.</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
