  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was down 321 points, or 0.9%, at 34,026, near its session low.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX retreated 39 points, or 1%, to 3,987.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite shed 96 points, or 0.9%, and dropped to 11,130.</p><p>U.S. stocks had notched weekly gains last week for the second time in three weeks. The Dow rose 1.8%, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.5% and the Nasdaq gained 0.7%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Wall Street started the week in a downbeat mood as traders absorbed the impact of unrest in China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HK:HSI closed down by 1.6% and most equity indexes across Asia also fell, with the exception of India's.</p><p>Worries about unrest in China spilled over into commodity markets, with West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery CLF23 briefly falling more than 3% to less than $74 per barrel before bouncing back.Meanwhile, copper prices HG00 were off 0.4% at $3.613 per pound.</p><p>\"Unprecedented waves of protest in China have caused ripples of unease across financial markets, as worries mount about repercussions for the world's second-largest economy,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p>\"As demonstrations spread across the country from Beijing to Xinjiang and Shanghai, reflecting rising anger about the zero-Covid policy, a sustained recovery in demand across the vast country appears even further away,\" Streeter added.</p><p>Signs that economic activity in China will continue to be disrupted by the protests, or by additional anti-COVID measures, will likely continue to weigh on commodity prices, analysts said. Meanwhile, concerns about global growth were helping to support government bond markets, where the yield on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y briefly traded at its lowest level since October earlier on Monday. In U.S. monetary-policy developments, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, speaking to MarketWatch on Monday, said he favors more aggressive interest-rate hikes to contain inflation, and that interest rates will likely need to stay elevated for all of 2023 and into 2024. His colleague John Williams, president of the New York Fed, said in prepared remarks prepared for a virtual event that further tightening is needed to cool inflation, which remains \"far too high.\" Taking overseas and U.S. events into account, \"what people are worried about is the potential for protests in China to spread and whether the population is reaching its breaking point,\" said Derek Tang, an economist at Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington. \"At the same time, Fed speak is ramping up and the message is there's more hike to come. So investors aren't finding relief.\" But the news wasn't all bad: Reports of strong online Black Friday sales helped boost the VanEck Retail ETF RTH, which was up 0.3% at $170.75, as well as shares of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, which were up 1.5%.</p><p>Investors can expect more information about the health of the U.S. economy in what's shaping up to be a busy week for U.S. economic data: Later this week, investors will receive the ADP employment report followed by the November jobs report. Revised data on third-quarter gross domestic product is due on Wednesday, along with the Fed studies of regional economies known as the beige book reports. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is set to speak publicly on Wednesday, and a closely watched gauge of inflation is due on Thursday.
