  "text": "<p>Mr. Young sparked the moves last week when he demanded that Spotify remove his music citing what he said was Covid-19 misinformation spread by Mr. Rogan. Folk singer Joni Mitchell and ​​rocker Nils Lofgren followed Mr. Young's move soon after.</p><p>Mr. Nash and Ms. Arie cited different reasons for their objections to Mr. Rogan. Mr. Nash, a former bandmate of Mr. Young, accused the podcaster of spreading disinformation \"in a way that could cost people their lives,\" he said in a statement posted to Instagram Tuesday.</p><p>\"Platforms like Spotify must be more responsible and accountable for the content they are obligated to moderate for the good of the public at large,\" he said.</p><p>Ms. Arie said she opposes the language Mr. Rogan uses around race and the amount of money he makes from Spotify. In 2020, Mr. Rogan signed an exclusive podcasting deal with Spotifyworth more than $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>\"This shows the type of company they are and the company that they keep,\" Ms. Arie said in reference to Spotify. She added: \"Neil Young opened a door that I MUST walk through.\"</p><p>Spotify representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Rogan late Sunday said he aimed to be more balanced and informed about controversial topics and guests. He said his show has grown \"out of control\" and said, \"If I pissed you off, I'm sorry,\" referring to the growing backlash against him and Spotify.</p><p>\"It's a strange responsibility to have this many viewers and listeners,\" Mr. Rogan said in a 10-minute video posted on Instagram. \"It's nothing that I've prepared for. I'm going to do my best to balance things out.\"</p><p>Spotify earlier Sunday made public its content policies, which it didn't alter, and created a Covid-19 information hub.</p><p>\"We haven't been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,\" said Chief Executive Daniel Ek in a blog post Sunday. \"It's become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely accepted information from the medical and scientific communities guiding us through this unprecedented time.\"</p><p>Spotify is the world's most popular music subscription streaming service, capturing 31% of the market in the second quarter of 2021, according to a report from MIDiA Research. Apple Inc.'s streaming-music service has a 15% market share and Amazon Music is third, capturing 13% of the market.</p><p>News Corp's Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a content partnership with Spotify's Gimlet Media unit.</p><p>THE UNFOLDING OF THE SPOTIFY CONTROVERSY</p><p>* Neil Young Pushes Amazon Music to Fans After Pulling Music From Spotify Amid Joe Rogan Controversy (Jan. 31)</p><p>* Joni Mitchell Removes Music From Spotify in Support of Neil Young Against Joe Rogan (Jan. 28)</p><p>* Neil Young's Radio Channel on SiriusXM Is Revived After Spotify Removal (Jan. 27)</p><p>* Spotify Takes Down Neil Young's Music After His Joe Rogan Ultimatum (Jan. 26)</p><p>* Neil Young Demands Spotify Remove His Music Over Joe Rogan's Vaccine Comments (Jan. 25)</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com</p><p>India Arie, Graham Nash Plan to Leave Spotify, Following Neil Young's Protest of Joe Rogan</p>",
