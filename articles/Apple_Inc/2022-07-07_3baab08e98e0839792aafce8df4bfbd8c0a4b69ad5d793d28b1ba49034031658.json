  "title": "Parents of Two Children Sue TikTok After Alleging They Died From Doing 'Blackout Challenge'; Wrongful-death suit alleges the social-media company's algorithm intentionally and repeatedly motivated both children to participate in the challenge",
  "text": "<p>The lawsuit filed last week in Superior Court in Los Angeles County alleges that TikTok's algorithm intentionally and repeatedly pushed the blackout challenge on the popular short-form video app and motivated both children to participate. The suit also claims that TikTok failed to warn minors and their parents that the app is addictive and pushes harmful content that could endanger the well-being of users.</p><p>\"TikTok knew or should have known that failing to take immediate and significant action to extinguish the spread of the deadly blackout challenge would result in more injuries and deaths, especially among children,\" the lawsuit said.</p><p>A spokeswoman for TikTok, whose parent company is China-based ByteDance Ltd., said the social-media company has never found evidence that this challenge has gone viral on the app. Any searches for the blackout challenge on the app will send users to a community guidelines page that has info about harmful challenges, she said.</p><p>\"This disturbing 'challenge,' which people seem to learn about from sources other than TikTok, long predates our platform and has never been a TikTok trend,\" the spokeswoman said. \"We remain vigilant in our commitment to user safety and would immediately remove related content if found. Our deepest sympathies go out to the family for their tragic loss.\"</p><p>This lawsuit follows a similar case filed in May by the mother of a 10-year-old girl who died attempting to do the blackout challenge. That lawsuit alleges that TikTok knew about the challenge and didn't stop its spread.</p><p>The TikTok spokeswoman declined to comment on pending litigation.</p><p>TikTok has grown into a massive social-media site that is projected to generate as much $12 billion in advertising this year based on its popularity with young users. The app was the world's most visited site on the internet in 2021, according to Cloudflare Inc., a cloud-infrastructure company that tracks internet traffic, exceeding the prior year's leader, Alphabet Inc.'s Google.</p><p>Some harmful content, however, has made its way onto the app. A Wall Street Journal investigation last year found that TikTok's algorithms can drive minors to videos about sex, drugs, depression and eating disorders. A group of state attorneys general is also investigating how the video-sharing platform contributes to online harms to children.</p><p>Some federal regulators are also concerned that TikTok poses security risks. Last week, Federal Communications Commission member Brendan Carr asked Apple Inc. and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, citing security concerns related to the data collected by the app on American users.</p><p>TikTok has said it uses encryption and security monitoring to secure user data, and that its access approval process is overseen by a U.S.-based security team.</p><p>Matthew Bergman, an attorney for the families suing TikTok, said the social-media company needs to be held accountable for pushing harmful content.</p><p>\"TikTok has invested billions of dollars to intentionally design products that push dangerous content that it knows are dangerous and can result in the deaths of its users,\" Mr. Bergman said.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>TikTok and Children</p><p>* Meta, TikTok Could Face Civil Liability if Held to Addict Children in California (June 29)</p><p>* Mother Sues TikTok After Alleging 10-Year-Old Daughter Died From Doing 'Blackout Challenge' (May 17)</p><p>* TikTok Brain Explained: Why Some Kids Seem Hooked on Social Video Feeds (April 2)</p><p>* TikTok Faces Scrutiny in State Attorneys General Probe of Online Harms to Children (March 2)</p><p>* How TikTok Inundates Teens With Eating-Disorder Videos (Dec. 17, 2021)</p><p>Parents of Two Children Sue TikTok After Alleging They Died From Doing 'Blackout Challenge'</p>",
