  "text": "<p>In a follow-up internal message to employees viewed by the Journal, Meta's Head of People, Lori Goler, said the company's 2023 budget would be \"very tight\" across all teams as Meta tries to minimize costs. The pause in recruiting would allow teams to focus on prioritizing important projects, she added. In the post, Ms. Goler said that Meta wouldn't automatically fill vacated roles and that the company was also pausing internal transfers to avoid bringing people into roles that could shift.</p><p>The social-media giant had already begun quietly nudging out a significant number of rank-and-file by reorganizing departments and giving affected employees a limited window to apply for other roles within the company.</p><p>Tech companies more broadly have been adjusting staffing after a period during which payrolls swelled. Snap Inc. last month said it would slash about 20% of its staff after growing its head count by around 65% since the end of 2020. Microsoft Corp. has said it is cutting a small percentage of its staff, and Twitter Inc. also has slimmed its workforce.</p><p>Meta has been adjusting its staffing plans for months after announcing in May that ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple Inc. last year would cost it some $10 billion this year. Meta is also facing challenges as a result of increased competition for users from rivals, particularly TikTok.</p><p>(More to Come)</p><p>Write to Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com and Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg Freezes Hiring at Facebook-Parent Meta</p>",
