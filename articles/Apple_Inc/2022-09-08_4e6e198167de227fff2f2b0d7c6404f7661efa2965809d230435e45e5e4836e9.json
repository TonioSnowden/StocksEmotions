  "text": "<p>\"But I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we have a president who respects our democracy and the rule of law and upholds our institutions,\" Clinton added.</p><p>Clinton's remark was a barely veiled reference to Donald Trump, whom she ran unsuccessfully against in 2016. The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol has presented evidence that the twice-impeached former president incited the riot at the Capitol complex in hope of forestalling congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory over Trump.

Clinton's likelihood of winning the nomination are currently listed on PredictIt at 6%.</p><p>Some have speculated that Biden, 79, won't run for re-election in 2024, but the White House has given every indication that he plans to seek another term — as has Biden himself. \"My plan is to run for re-election,\" Biden said at his first news conference as commander-in-chief. \"That's my expectation.\"</p><p>Read on: Gavin Newsom says 2024 presidential bid is 'not gonna happen'</p><p>Hillary Clinton says, 'No, no,' she won't run for president again</p>",
