  "title": "The Ambassadors by Robert Cooper — the burden of success",
  "text": "<p>China's accession to superpower status is upsetting the post-cold war order, stirring memories of pre-1914 Wilhelmine Germany claiming its “place in the sun”. More broadly, authoritarianism and populism march hand in hand, challenging democratic governance and the international system. In these times of growing domestic and international uncertainty, statecraft of the highest calibre will be necessary if we are to avoid repeating some of the mistakes of the past.</p> <p>Robert Cooper's new book helps us think through what that implies. <em>The Ambassadors</em> comes with a slightly deceptive title. This is not primarily a work about ambassadors or the job of diplomacy. Readers expecting a latter-day update of Harold Nicolson's 1939 classic <em>Diplomacy</em> will be disappointed. Rather, the author — a distinguished British and European diplomat and thinker on international affairs — trains his focus on the art and importance of statecraft as revealed through its practitioners. </p> <p>Rulemaking statesmen are at the centre of the action, rather than rule-taking career diplomats. In our age of diversity and given the prevalence of the Annales school of history with its emphasis on impersonal forces, Cooper's focus on “great western men” may seem anachronistic. Yet, within its context, it is accurate. For better or worse, the modern state was crafted mainly by men, and its DNA is basically western, even as it has become the global norm. Few governments are as wedded to the Westphalian idea of a nation state as those of communist China or klepto-authoritarian Russia. The modern state, and the international order in which it operates, did not appear from nowhere. And by convening the likes of Machiavelli, Mazarin and their peers, Cooper helps us understand how it happened.</p> <p>A statesman operating at the right place and the right time can play a decisive personal role in shaping foreign policy, much like a military commander will bear the burden of success or failure on the field of battle. Cooper also rightly highlights the successful players rather than the duds: success is more fruitful than failure — and all the more interesting for being relatively rare.</p> <p>There are costs to this person-centric approach as it precludes emphasising the changing social and technical conditions under which international statecraft is practised. The growing ease of communication, the emergence of the media, and the changing nature of public opinion are peripheral to Cooper's argument. Yet, it is good to have a serious treatment on the fundamentals of statecraft, in the same way that we rely on Sun Tzu or Clausewitz to inform our thinking on the art of war. </p> <p>Cooper eschews a single narrative arc, relying instead on “fragments”, in effect a gallery of portraits of actors, from the well known (Machiavelli, Kohl and so on) to the more obscure (Chiune Sugihara, Japanese vice-consul in Lithuania in the 1940), each illustrating aspects of responses to and shaping of events. There is nonetheless a coherent story of five centuries of positive continuity: the invention of the modern state; the move from hierarchy to equal sovereignty; the tumultuous conception of a European order; the recognition that peace may be a more rewarding default than war; the creation of a western liberal system; the attempt to control the nuclear beast; and the peaceful move out of the Cold War.</p> <p>This is told with erudition and <em>con molto brio</em>. The account of Richelieu's navigation between competing power centres personified by Marie de Medicis and Anne d'Autriche in a religiously divided France and Europe is both instructive and entertaining. The accomplishments of some are deservedly burnished, not least Ernest Bevin. It was Britain's post-1945 Labour foreign secretary who, with support from Bidault in France, delivered the impetus for a multilateral transatlantic defensive alliance. Thus, the idea of Nato came from the eastern side of the Atlantic and Europe did not end up like America's Asian allies in a hub-and-spoke relationship with Washington and all the associated limitations and risks. There were no Korean and Vietnam wars in cold war Europe. </p> <p>Cooper also puts Henry Kissinger's legacy into a more finely nuanced perspective than is customary from either his detractors or cheerleaders. Talleyrand's portrait, however, is more disturbing: this highly talented man who helped give his defeated country equal standing with the victorious powers at the post-Napoleonic Congress of Vienna, remains fascinating. But “admiration” may be too strong a word for one whose venality and cupidity as a negotiator should preclude him from the place Cooper offers him in the Pantheon of those such as De Gaulle or Monnet, who had “<em>une certaine idée de la France”</em>.</p> <p>The underlying narrative of progress has the drawback of excluding those who were successful on their own terms, such as Bismarck, but who do not settle gracefully in to an upward-moving sequence. It is the author's right to dislike the Iron Chancellor, but it is the reader's loss. Bismarck did after all play a key role in creating a united German state, making it the pivot of the European, and by extension, the world system. The fact that his statecraft relied heavily on blood and steel can be deplored but not more so than, say, in the case of Richelieu.</p> <p>The author's reflections on the nature and uses of power as on the art of negotiation deserve full attention. He makes the point that “big powers don't bluff”, when referring to the manner in which Finland misread Stalin's intentions before the Soviet Union's attack in 1939. One could add that when they do bluff, as Barack Obama did with his “red lines” during the Syrian crisis of 2013, the consequences can be unfortunate if the bluff is called. </p> <p>Cooper's words on lying are no less wise. States can and do lie, but it is a dangerous practice: for what then is the point of talking, which is what the contenders may eventually have to do? But the most memorable recommendation is the one about the readiness to disobey instructions, as did those who helped save fellow human beings to flee Nazi Germany. Those rule-breakers were a minority.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0297608533/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0297608533&amp;linkId=6815434fffa06f9cd6d174d97bab93eb\"><strong>The Ambassadors</strong></a><strong>: Thinking about Diplomacy from Machiavelli to Modern Times</strong>, by Robert Cooper, <em>Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, RRP£25, 564 pages </em></p> <p><em>François Heisbourg is special adviser to the Paris-based Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique, a think-tank, and a former diplomat</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
