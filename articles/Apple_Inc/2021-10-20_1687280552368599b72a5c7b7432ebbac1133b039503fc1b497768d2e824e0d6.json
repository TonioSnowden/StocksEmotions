  "text": "<p>Elton John is a chart obsessive. Each week he receives the latest data from the world's key markets — new releases, trending songs, the biggest hits — which he combs through, jotting down details in his diary. Perhaps the most recent entry has been underlined several times, circled and decorated with exclamation marks — for currently topping the UK charts is Elton himself, with his first number one single since 2005. </p> <p>“Cold Heart” is the lead single from his new album <em>The Lockdown Sessions</em>. A slinky disco number helmed by Australian production group Pnau, it pairs the singer, 74, with a star almost 50 years his junior, Dua Lipa. She delivers a coolly sung refrain taken from <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/life-of-a-song/rocket-man.html\">“Rocket Man”</a>, his 1972 hit, while he sings a part sampled from his 1989 song “Sacrifice”. Two other tracks from his back catalogue are interpolated into the song too, a shimmery fusion of old and new. It makes him the first act to have UK top 10 hits in six different decades. </p> <p>His determination to stay current marks him out from knightly peers in the British pop establishment. His great frenemy Rod Stewart might hold the record for oldest male singer to top the UK album charts, for 2019's <em>You're In My Heart</em>, a record currently beyond Elton's reach. But it's impossible to imagine Sir Rod hollering gamely with Young Thug and Nicki Minaj, as Sir Elton does on <em>The Lockdown Sessions</em>, or mouthing stentorian platitudes about every root having branches, as we find the Rocketman doing in the company of country singer Jimmie Allen on another track.</p> <p>The album is a byproduct of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df6d6ba8-6cd8-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d\">Elton's marathon farewell tour</a> being forced off the road last year. It's an enjoyable curate's egg of released and unreleased songs. Some are tracks that he has guested on for other artists, such as a piano-playing turn on Lil Nas X's “One of Me”, one of the better moments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b8b1149-8998-43fa-a2fa-e791a0cc54aa\">the rapper's debut album</a>, and a vocal co-lead on Gorillaz's “The Pink Phantom”, a highlight from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e89bd76-4033-4500-8980-50e3a1b1be8b\">the cartoon group's most recent album</a>. Alongside these are new songs made by Elton himself during the touring lay-off, each with their own guests, many encountered by him on his radio show for Apple Music. </p> <p>Young Thug and Minaj turn up on “Always Love You”, a diverting union of 1970s piano pomp and modern US rap. “After All”, with teen-pop singer Charlie Puth, is a well-worked piece of commercial balladry, although Elton's voice sounds like it has been subjected to the vocal-processing equivalent of Botox. “E-Ticket” with Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder makes a rambunctious return to Elton's piano-rocking prime. Stevie Wonder joins for a decent gospel-pop duet with “Finish Line”, Stevie Nicks does an entertaining Bonnie-and-Clyde routine with him on “Stolen Car”, and Glen Campbell, who died in 2017, makes a fragile-sounding posthumous appearance on the robustly Beatles-like “I'm Not Gonna Miss You”.&#xa0;</p> <p>These songs have been ushered into the world with a generous helping of knightly gush. “Finish Line” is “one of the best records I've ever made”, Lil Nas X is “one of the most influential voices in pop culture”, and so on. Backslapping and glad-handing make for odd mood music in the context of a lockdown album. But what really animates it is Elton's pop obsessiveness, his drive to keep pounding on.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>‘</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09DMXKHGJ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B09DMXKHGJ\"><em>The Lockdown Sessions</em></a><em>' is released by EMI Universal</em></p><p>Source: Ludovic Hunter-Tilney 2021 'Elton John reveals the fruits of his lay-off in The Lockdown Sessions ' FT.com 20 October.
