  "title": "Twitter Revenue Declines On Slide In Ads --- Slackening demand echoes Snap's warning, also reflects wariness around deal with Musk",
  "text": "<p>Digital companies often are the first to be hit by an ad slowdown since marketers can turn off spending in real time, industry observers said. Other forms of advertising, such as buying TV commercials, are much harder to cancel at a moment's notice, they said.</p><p>Smaller platforms such as Twitter and Snapchat also are at risk if marketers shift spending to more established players such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook, MoffettNathanson said in a note Friday. Alphabet and Meta report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Combined, Google and Meta are expected to account for about 50% of worldwide digital ad revenues this year, according to Insider Intelligence.</p><p>Overall, Twitter's revenue slipped to $1.18 billion from $1.19 billion a year ago, and was below the average analyst estimate of $1.32 billion on FactSet. Advertising revenue rose 2% from a year earlier to $1.08 billion; by comparison, in the first quarter advertising revenue grew 23%.</p><p>Twitter cited \"advertising industry headwinds associated with the macroenvironment as well as uncertainty related to the pending acquisition of Twitter.\" The company said it wouldn't host an earnings conference call because of the pending transaction; Twitter is suing Mr. Musk to complete the deal after he said he wanted to terminate it.</p><p>Twitter's slowdown in ad revenue suggests the turmoil surrounding Mr. Musk's deal is irking advertisers, said Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali. \"Advertisers don't even want to deal with Twitter until they know what's going on,\" he said. The company is \"caught in the middle of a nightmare.\"</p><p>Mr. Musk's $54.20-a-share bid for Twitter has helped hold up the company's stock price amid a sharp selloff in tech-sector stocks. Twitter's stock price is down less than 10% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has lost more than 20%.</p><p>Twitter shares rose 0.8% on Friday, in contrast to the sharp selloff of Snap, whose shares plunged 39%.</p><p>\"Thank God they have a deal in place because the stock would be so much lower without it,\" said MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson.</p><p>Worsening macroeconomic conditions aren't the only challenge that digital-advertising firms have had to deal with in recent months. Most of them are still grappling with the effects of Apple Inc.'s changes to its ad-tracking systems, which has limited how platforms collect data and measure the performance of marketing campaigns.</p><p>They are also dealing with the emergence of a fast-growing competitor: TikTok, the popular video-sharing app from Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. With its more than one billion monthly active users, TikTok is projected to generate as much as $12 billion in advertising revenue this year -- triple the amount seen in 2021.</p><p>Twitter reported a loss of $270 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with year-ago earnings of $65.6 million, or 8 cents a share. Excluding items like stock-based compensation, the company reported an adjusted loss of 8 cents a share. Analysts, on average, were expecting an adjusted profit of 14 cents a share, FactSet shows.</p><p>The number of Twitter's monetizable average daily active users increased to 237.8 million from 229 million in the first quarter and 206 million a year ago. U.S. users grew to 41.5 million from 39.6 million in the first quarter and 37 million a year ago. The company said the increase was driven by product improvements and global conversation around current events.</p><p>A spokesman said Twitter has made more than a dozen recent product innovations, including Twitter Circle, a way to send tweets to a select group; CoTweets, which let two co-authors of a tweet post it simultaneously; and Unmention, a feature that lets users remove themselves from Twitter conversations they were brought into by others.</p><p>In April, Twitter said it was withdrawing earlier goals and outlooks and that it wouldn't provide forward-looking guidance. Before Mr. Musk's courtship, Twitter had been working to achieve three main goals by the end of 2023: to surpass $7.5 billion in annual revenue, reach 315 million daily users and double the pace at which it produces new technology.</p><p>Mr. Musk has said his primary reason for backing out of the deal is a lack of faith in Twitter's estimate that less than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are spam or fake accounts. He has said that estimate is probably too low.</p><p>Twitter has said for years in its securities filings that the number of fake and spam accounts on its platform could be higher than its estimates. The company said in its lawsuit against Mr. Musk that he has buyer's remorse over the fall in share prices since he agreed to the deal in April.</p><p>In its lawsuit against Mr. Musk, Twitter said his \"actions in derogation of the deal's consummation, and Musk's repeated disparagement of Twitter and its personnel, create uncertainty.\" Such behaviors \"also expose Twitter to adverse effects on its business operations, employees, and stock price,\" the complaint said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
