  "title": "Beyond Order, by Jordan Peterson — more orders from chaos",
  "text": "<p>Fifty pages into Jordan Peterson's new book, <em>Beyond Order</em>, I called the FT books editor. I don't think we ought to review this, I said. I explained that the author had suffered three years of emotional and physical hell, which he dispassionately catalogues in the book's introduction. He'd become addicted to an anti-anxiety drug, which he started taking after he drank some apple cider that didn't agree with him. He'd tried to come off the drug, had been suicidal and diagnosed with schizophrenia — after which he flew to Moscow against his doctors' orders to a hospital where they put him in a coma for nine days to help with the detox, after which he had to relearn how to walk. He ended up in a rehab clinic in Serbia — and also contracted Covid-19. Over those same three years, his wife nearly died of cancer, and he had to deal with the stress of going from being an obscure Canadian psychology professor to a global sensation doing a 160-stop world tour and being watched by 200m people on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q\">YouTube</a>. </p> <p>I told the editor that, apart from the brief and riveting “Overture” describing this trip to hell, the new book was so far unreadable. It is billed as a book to comfort us in these unstable times and connect us with our inner strength, partly by showing how much of “life's meaning” is to be found by reaching beyond the ordered domain of what we know. </p> <p>At first glance, the result certainly seems chaotic. One minute Peterson is telling you to imagine who you could be and aim at that, then he's on about ancient alchemists, then discussing unwelcome letters one might receive from the tax authorities, then back to some mystic stuff about Jupiter and Mars, leading to an extended account of how the snitch in Quidditch, the game played at JK Rowling's Hogwarts, symbolises chaos. The poor man must have been unwell when he wrote all this, so it would be unfair to trash it.</p> <p>I even wondered why the people at Penguin had rushed to publish it, when they should have told him to wait until he was better. But then publishing is a rough, tough business and as his last book, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40c05b84-f7a7-11e7-a4c9-bbdefa4f210b\"><em>12 Rules for Life</em></a>, had sold more than five million copies, and cornered the market for wordy, academic books that rage against identity politics and political correctness. One can see why they were gagging for Peterson's next dozen rules, even if they couldn't make head nor tail of them.</p> <p>Two things changed my mind about the fairness of writing this. The first was seeing an early review, which assured me that the new book was more of the same as its wildly successful prequel and there was no sign of damage from his trauma and illness. The second was persevering with the rest of the 400 pages and finding myself, if not exactly hooked, then increasingly fascinated by its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d2e6802-6040-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68\">author</a>. </p> <p>I had come to Peterson cold, or as cold as is possible for anyone who doesn't live under a stone. I'd seen his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54\">famous interview</a> with Cathy Newman on <em>Channel 4 News</em> three years ago that shot him to celebrity, and gawped as he politely, lucidly dealt with her hostile questions. </p> <p>I knew that to many on the right he's the world's greatest living public intellectual, while many on the left see him as a dangerous bigot and seem cross that he's allowed to publish at all.</p> <p>But from the evidence in this book, it's hard to understand why feelings run quite so strongly. I found nothing in it to get cross about except for the fact that he expects the reader to do too much heavy lifting. I did slightly object to his implication that the poor have only themselves to blame, but then he should be allowed his view. He appears serious-minded, clever and knows his Freud and his Wordsworth. He likes family values. He believes in hard work and discipline. And he's very religious. Almost every path, no matter how trivially it starts, leads him to the Bible, or thereabouts.</p> <p>Rule VII is to “work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens”. This seems sensible enough — people who settle down to work at something tend to be happier than those who don't. But then, before you know it, he's on to the Ten Commandments, and ends by declaring that hard work leads to the “word of truth, upon whose function all habitable order, wrenched out of chaos, eternally depends”. </p> <p>Even my favourite Rule VIII — “Try to make one room in your home as beautiful as possible” — leads briskly to the divine. This was particularly cheering to me as I've spent much of two lockdowns prettifying my house, a pastime I'd previously seen as a bit shallow. Not so: it connects me to the “true beauty and majesty of the Being you can no longer see”.</p> <p>Although I don't share the holiness, I don't dislike it; what troubles me more about his rules is that they may be a less universal guide to life than he maintains. </p> <p>Rule III, nicely summarised as “have the damn fight”, is a plea to get things out into the open. He tells a funny story of his father-in-law, who spent 20 years not telling his wife that he didn't like his lunchtime sandwich on a small plate, only one day to explode. But is it always good to have the fight at the outset? If I'd mentioned everything that irritated me early in the relationships I've had, I doubt if any would have survived a month. </p> <p>On marriage (Rule X: Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship), he's also too definite. Though all people who are currently going through the miserable business of dating will be heartened by his idea that there are 100m people out there who would suit them, I just don't think he's right that couples should always stay together. </p> <p>For me, the great public intellectual is less Peterson than Kenny Rogers, who saw everything as more nuanced. His rule — know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em — nailed it: the skill is in recognising which case is which. </p> <p>More interesting than his rules is Peterson himself, who comes over as astonishingly odd. My favourite glimpse of him is obsessively describing the decor of his house, which has 36 colours in many paint finishes, all taken from the palettes of the Socialist Realist paintings he loves. Indeed, he likes collecting these so much that at one time he was looking at 1,000 pictures a day on eBay. As a fellow obsessive, who on a bad day does about 100 William Morris linen fabrics on eBay, I am in awe of his single-mindedness, and wonder how he managed alongside all his reading and writing and delivering all those spookily brilliant YouTube lectures. </p> <p>Yet despite this impression of an exacting, driven, obsessive, I also get the idea of someone who is kind. His accounts of his patients are curious, humane and forgiving — even the squabbling, hard-boiled married couple who can't bear the thought of going on a date with each other. At the end of the book, he individually thanks all the people who have helped him when he was ill. In most books the acknowledgments feel perfunctory; these felt full of grace. </p> <p>While his reluctance to write about his own psychological state is understandable — and, indeed, is not what the book is about — Peterson leaves me longing to know more. Has he changed his views on strong men as a result of his own vulnerability? Were any of his rules actually helpful as he recovered? </p> <p>Most of all I want to know about his darkness. The notes of despair are everywhere. Maybe his hysterical love of order is because he views the natural state of the universe as more petrifying than most. Nearly every chapter ends by pointing to the terror that lurks. The reason it is important to hold a marriage together is not because of the joys of loving another person, but because “rough times are always on their way, and you better have something to set against them or despair will visit and will not depart”.</p> <p>He ends the book by saying we should be grateful in spite of our suffering. Gratitude, he says, is “something in which you can discover part of the antidote to the abyss and the darkness”.</p> <p>As I read this last line, I found myself saying “amen”. And I realised what Jordan Peterson really is. He has suffered more than most of us. He has seen the abyss. And he has emerged from it not a top public intellectual but a highly driven, intelligent, complex and deservedly successful preacher.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241407621/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0241407621&amp;linkId=f9d40f65e9409a015976c96d9e58056a\"><strong>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life</strong></a> by Jordan B Peterson, <em>Allen Lane RRP£25/Portfolio Penguin RRP$29, 432 pages</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/lucy-kellaway\"><em>Lucy Kellaway</em></a><em> is an FT contributing editor</em></p> <p> <em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Lucy Kellaway 2021 'Beyond Order, by Jordan Peterson — more orders from chaos' FT.com 10 March.
