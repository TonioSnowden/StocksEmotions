  "text": "<p>With unions shaking up some of America's biggest companies — including Amazon, Starbucks and Apple — workers have found an ally in Joe Biden's top labour relations official.</p> <p>Jennifer Abruzzo, who took over as the government's chief prosecutor of labour law violations a year ago, is working to limit the ways some of the country's largest employers can subvert employee unions. So far during her tenure as general counsel the National Labor Relations Board is pursuing more cases, and different kinds of actions, than it has in the past. </p> <p>For instance, last month the NLRB's Buffalo, New York, division filed for a national cease and desist order to stop <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/8deb351d-4c02-40ce-aada-54004dd33dfc\">Starbucks</a> from engaging in anti-union activities. It had already sued the coffee chain to reinstate employees involved in unionisation efforts in Buffalo; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Memphis, Tennessee, who were later fired. </p> <p>The agency also reran a high-profile <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/61b3414d-9e45-4962-a2d1-134453f5af02\">union </a>election at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama, saying the retailer gave workers the impression they were being surveilled by placing a dedicated mailbox for ballots out front. </p> <p>Abruzzo said she sees the agency starting to “balance” the interests of workers and employers, after union leaders have complained for decades that federal policies give businesses too much power over the people who work for them.</p> <p>“Whether you're a high-profile employer or you're not, sometimes you engage in conduct that requires us to seek immediate injunctive relief,” Abruzzo told the Financial Times during an interview from her office in Washington.</p> <p>Under Abruzzo, the NLRB is seeking to reinterpret existing rules to stop employers from using two of the most common union-avoidance strategies — hosting so-called “captive-audience” meetings where employers can host mandatory sessions for staff and dismissing employees who become union leaders.</p> <p>The moves are part of Abruzzo's long-term plan to pursue employer violations more aggressively than her predecessors. Since she took office halfway through fiscal year 2021, the total fees, fines and backpay for workers that the agency collected jumped 44.2 per cent to $57mn, up from $39mn in the year before. </p> <p>She has also signalled her preference that more informal “card checks” — which require a majority of employees to sign up to join the union — to replace the lengthier election process to certify new unions.</p> <p>Another priority of Abruzzo's is to make the NLRB more proactive in its outreach to workers interested in unionising. Hearing Chris Smalls — the president of the Amazon Labor Union who spearheaded an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52d94def-fe4a-487e-af87-1807232ed377\">unlikely win</a> at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, earlier this year — say that many employees were unaware that the agency could get involved if the company retaliated against them for organising encouraged her to redouble education efforts, she said: “This is my biggest fear.”</p> <p>US workers' interest in organising unions has surged as conditions in many low-wage, in-person workplaces deteriorated during the Covid-19 crisis while a tight labour market and widespread worker shortages have given staff more leverage. </p> <p>The NLRB reported a 57 per cent spike in the number of petitions for union elections between October and March, up to 1,174 from 748 during the same period last year. High-profile election victories at the Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, an Apple store in Maryland, and more than 100 Starbucks stores across the country buoyed the enthusiasm. </p> <p>But even as Americans' perceptions of unions have improved, membership stagnated, which union leaders attribute to the relative difficulty of establishing a new union in the US compared to other rich countries.</p> <p>Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/08/remarks-by-president-biden-in-honor-of-labor-unions/\">calls himself</a> “the most pro-union president leading the most pro-union administration in American history”. But with legislation aimed at simplifying the process of organising new unions stalled in Congress, Abruzzo's pro-worker interpretation of existing labour laws is a more effective policy tool. </p> <p>Abruzzo said her enforcements are not politically motivated, but she is critical of her predecessor, Peter Robb, a longtime management lawyer known for working with the Reagan administration's strategy to break the 1981 air traffic controllers strike. He was appointed by then-president Donald Trump and fired by Biden on the day he was inaugurated — the first time a president had fired a general counsel in the agency's 86-year history.</p> <p>“I felt that under the Trump board, they expanded the loss of protection that workers have when they're actually trying to engage to improve their working conditions,” Abruzzo said, “and I just don't think that comports with our congressional mandate, frankly.”</p> <p>Abruzzo has spent the majority of her career with the NLRB, working first as a field attorney in Miami and deputy general counsel under the Obama administration. She left the agency during the Trump administration to work for the 450,000-member Communications Workers of America union. </p> <p>Abruzzo said she is encouraged by the recent wave of workers exercising their right to organise, and that the movement is spreading to new traditionally non-union industries such as food service and tech. “But unfortunately, what hasn't improved is there are the same violations of the statute occurring,” she said.</p> <p>The shift from Robb, whom union leaders accused of favouring employers, to Abruzzo has made this the most labour-friendly environment in decades, said Kate Andrias, a professor at Columbia Law School who studies organised labour. Biden also appointed two new members to the board itself, which rules on administrative cases, cementing its pro-labour tilt as well.</p> <p>“It makes quite a bit of difference because in a host of different ways, this general counsel and the new majority on the board have suggested that they believe that workers' rights should be protected,” Andrias said. “The problem is that even where the board just pursues, all of the remedies that are available under the existing laws are still not really adequate counterweight.”</p> <p>Some employers are less pleased with NLRB's legal tactics under Abruzzo. After the Amazon Labor Union's election victory on Staten Island earlier this year, the retailer accused the board's Brooklyn regional office of favouring workers.</p> <p>Still, unions say that they continue to face fierce resistance from their employers despite the agency's crackdown. And Abruzzo's authority has significant gaps. </p> <p>The NLRB cannot change existing labour laws, only how they are interpreted. Decisions by the general counsel can be quickly reversed if a new Republican US president appoints a board whose majority comes from his own party. Abruzzo also said her budget “flatlined” and her staff was depleted after an exodus of field attorneys under Robb, making it increasingly difficult to keep up with the wave of union activity. </p> <p>But while she has reins of the federal labour agency, Abruzzo still intends to shield workers. “It's important to me that [workers] know that their government is working for them,” she said.</p><p>Source: Taylor Nicole Rogers in New York 2022 'Top Biden labour lawyer vows to shift power back to workers' FT.com 7 July.
