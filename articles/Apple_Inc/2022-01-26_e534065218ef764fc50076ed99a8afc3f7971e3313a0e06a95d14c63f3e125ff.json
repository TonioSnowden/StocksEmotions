  "title": "What to Watch: 'The Gilded Age' and Six More Things to Stream This Weekend; Julian Fellowes gives New York the 'Downton Abbey' treatment. Tiffany Haddish and Kristen Bell find laughs amid murders.",
  "text": "<p>(HBO, HBO Max)</p><p>HBO hopes \"Downton Abbey\" fans will follow that show's creator, Julian Fellowes, to 1880s New York for \"The Gilded Age.\" This series is another period drama about the parallel worlds that exist in cities, neighborhoods, homes and families, and what happens when they collide. Lord Fellowes's characters once again have money and empty pockets, embrace the future, cling to the past and think they know best whom their children should marry.</p><p>\"The Gilded Age\" begins with a penniless woman (Louisa Jacobson) moving in with old-money relatives Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski) and Ada Brook (Cynthia Nixon), just as the new-money Russell family moves into the opulent home they built across the street. Bertha Russell (Carrie Coon) is determined to break into the upper echelons of New York society, while van Rhijn is determined to keep her out.</p><p>Ms. Nixon notes that while the other series she stars in about women in New York (the \"Sex and the City\" reboot \"And Just Like That…\") is about female comradeship, \"The Gilded Age\" is about female competition. Since it is a Julian Fellowes production, period details—from corsets to tea time—are everything.</p><p>\"We gave up asking: Do I really need this teaspoon? I'm not having sugar in my tea. I'm not having milk in my tea. I don't need to stir anything. And it's making a problem for the sound department,\" Ms. Nixon recalls asking, to no avail. \"So they didn't clatter and make noise, we eventually just had the prop department actually glue the spoons down.\"</p><p>\"The Gilded Age\" premiered this week on HBO and HBO Max.</p><p>'The Afterparty'</p><p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>Tiffany Haddish didn't read ahead in the scripts for \"The Afterparty.\" So while she was shooting the murder mystery, she was guessing along as if she were watching the show from home. Historically, she says, she'd been pretty good at figuring out who did it. After the first episode, she had a solid guess.</p><p>\"I thought one of the pregnant ladies did it,\" she said in a recent Zoom call. \"They're the least suspect, and the one disappeared, like, said her water broke. Really?\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"The Afterparty\" is created by Chris Miller, who also executive produced the series with his longtime collaborator, Phil Lord. (They are the team behind \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" and the \"21 Jump Street\" movies.) This ensemble features comedy cool kids Ilana Glazer (\"Broad City\"), Sam Richardson (\"Veep\") and John Early (\"Search Party\").</p><p>It begins when police are called to the mansion of a pop star (Dave Franco) who fell to his death while hosting a party following the group's high school reunion. Each of the attendees is interviewed by a police detective (Ms. Haddish). In each telling, the story of the reunion and the afterparty takes a different turn and screen genre, from rom-com and action to musical.</p><p>By the time they shot the revealing scene, Ms. Haddish says she had put enough of the pieces together to know exactly who did it. (No hints here on whether her initial hypothesis was correct.)</p><p>\"Intuition is everything, baby,\" she says. \"And paying attention to the things people say.\"</p><p>\"The Afterparty\" premieres Friday on Apple TV+.</p><p>'The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window'</p><p>(Netflix)</p><p>The new Netflix series \"The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window\" is a dark comedy that satirizes psychological thrillers about women—think \"The Girl on the Train\" and \"The Woman in the Window.\" Kristen Bell plays Anna, a divorced mother grieving the death of her daughter. The manner of her death is one of the things that hooked Ms. Bell on the project.</p><p>\"I had never seen bolder jokes in my [life],\" she says. \"The way my daughter has died in this show, I thought: I don't even know if we're allowed to make that kind of a joke.\"</p><p>The grieving Anna spends her days as a living cliché, sitting in a chair by the window nursing an absurdly overfull glass of wine. A seemingly nice, attractive dad (Tom Riley) and his daughter (Samsara Yett) move into the house across the street. Anna obsesses over them through the window. One day, she is sure she has witnessed a murder in their house. Of course, few people believe her.</p><p>Ms. Bell says that early in the shoot, she worried that the subtlety of the humor wouldn't come through in her performance. The creators told her they didn't want her playing to the joke at all.</p><p>\"At the end, I realized I had been dying to do great, bad acting forever,\" she says. \"I was able to do it in this project.\"</p><p>\"The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window\" begins streaming Friday on Netflix.</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>— In \"Home Team,\" a new movie that begins streaming Friday on Netflix, Kevin James plays New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton. It focuses on the season he spent coaching his son's youth football team while he was suspended from coaching in the NFL.</p><p>— \"The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild,\" the sixth feature film in the \"Ice Age\"' animated film franchise, begins streaming Friday on Disney+. The five theatrical feature films in the franchise also are streaming on the service.</p><p>— Remembering Louie Anderson: Actor and comedian Louie Anderson died last week at 68. His performances in recent yearsincluded roles on \"Baskets\" (Hulu) and \"Coming 2 America\" (Prime Video).</p><p>When he spoke to What to Watchat the end of 2020, he mentioned that the success of \"Schitt's Creek\" on Netflix had \"reinspired me to realize that if you know how to make comedy, you should make comedy. You don't have to make it for Netflix. For God's sake, they were on Pop TV.</p><p>\"The greatest thing about the streaming is eventually someone will find the art that you put your heart and soul into and they'll watch it. And you won't know 'em, you may not care what they think, but you are doing the job you originally intended, which is to entertain. And in my case, I always wanted people to feel better.\"</p><p>What to Watch: 'The Gilded Age' and Six More Things to Stream This Weekend</p>",
