Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-08-27/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>US president Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b78231ae-4d84-4f9b-b466-8d59cd3f09ba\">vowed to plough ahead</a> with the evacuation of those trying to flee Afghanistan and punish the perpetrators of an attack outside Kabul's international airport that killed 13 US military personnel and dozens of Afghans.</p> <p>In an attempt to appear both a sombre mourner-in-chief and a resolute leader steeling the nation for what could be a difficult final withdrawal from the Afghan capital, Biden addressed the nation yesterday from the White House.</p> <p>“We will not be deterred by terrorists, we will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation,” Biden said in an emotional address. “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.”</p> <p>At least 13 US military personnel died after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/817bfbaa-e62a-4cc9-b503-54d0a53dfc52\">two suicide bombs exploded</a> near Kabul's airport yesterday. The number of Afghan civilians killed in the twin attacks has risen to at least 95, according to the Associated Press newswire. </p> <p>The deadly attacks were carried out by an Isis-affiliated group and severely disrupted western efforts to wind up the evacuation of Kabul airport. The British government said today the “final stages” of its evacuation programme had begun. Germany, Spain and Canada have already completed their withdrawals. Clement Beaune, French European affairs minister, said France's evacuation operation would end “soon”. </p> <h2>More on Afghanistan: </h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Edward Luce:</strong> This is potentially Joe Biden's Jimmy Carter moment. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>‘Herat is now like a ghost city': </strong>How Afghanistan's third-largest city is adapting to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d30d1991-252e-4060-aa98-b5831e3f470c\">Taliban rule</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>What next for Afghanistan?</strong> Former CIA director-general David Petraeus and ex-Afghan central bank governor Ajmal Ahmady discuss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/d2bd6088-ad90-47c6-af09-ae73ce56bc85\">the future of Afghanistan</a> with FT journalists at a special live event.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Follow the latest coverage of Afghanistan on </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/afghanistan\"><em>FT.com</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><em>Thanks as always for reading FirstFT Americas.
