  "text": "<p>Last week was the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, when Jewish people attend synagogue, say prayers of remembrance and repentance and eat apple and honey to represent the promise of a sweet and fruitful 12 months ahead. <a href=\"https://www.sephardi.org.uk/about/rabbis/rabbi-shalom-morris/\">Rabbi Shalom Morris</a> of Bevis Marks, a 320-year-old synagogue in the heart of the City of London, could have been forgiven, however, if his mind had not been on prayers and penitence but on the City of London Corporation's planning committee.</p> <p>Bevis Marks, an elegant two-storey building of umber brick and large windows in the <a href=\"https://www.sephardi.org.uk/bevis-marks/history-design/\">style of Christopher Wren</a>, has preserved its historic, largely unelectrified interior, conducting its services bathed in natural light or, on dark evenings, candlelight from gigantic chandeliers. Now the light and, with it, the services are threatened by planning applications for two towers — <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-58409342\">one 21 storeys, one 48</a> — in neighbouring streets. A study commissioned by the synagogue, the UK's oldest in continuous use, shows that it would enjoy just one hour of sunlight a day if the towers go up.</p> <p>“Closing the buildings around us means the light will stop falling on this place, we'll be overshadowed — literally,” says Morris, standing in the synagogue's quiet courtyard, through which generations of the same families, as well as students, tourists and City workers, have walked. “Nobody is arguing there will be no harm to the synagogue — the arguments are how much harm will happen . . . You wouldn't do that around St Paul's, that's just obvious.” </p> <p>Because Bevis Marks is on the highest grade of the <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1064745\">UK's national heritage register</a> — “its little altered state is of exceptional historic interest”, its citation says — the synagogue could not simply fit floodlights inside, even if that were desirable. Natural light is a vital part of Judaism, Morris says. The position of the sun or moon determines the timing of various rituals, “but on a more spiritual plane it makes a huge difference to the experience of a place when the light does filter in here.” </p> <p>It is a strange moment to be discussing erecting towers in the Square Mile: companies have survived without occupying them for 18 months and are reducing their need with more flexible work-from-home policies. On Friday, despite predictions workers would flood back, the streets around Bevis Marks were ghostly. To Morris, the synagogue's struggle reveals the corporation's post-Brexit, post-Covid problem: “What's the City's real strategy for survival? Putting up another tower does not seem like the answer.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.paviors.org.uk/discover-the-paviors/sir-michael-bear\">Sir Michael Bear</a>, a former lord mayor of the City of London, is strongly supportive of much of the City's redevelopment but has drawn the line at obscuring Bevis Marks. “My view,” he says, “is that [the corporation's] attention has been taken off the ball, they're so concerned about Covid, Brexit and other debates and statues and things . . . they don't feel the concern and the outrage of the community.” It is rare, he points out, for a former lord mayor to speak out against the corporation.</p> <p>Arguments around balancing the right to light of historic buildings against the need for development (which invariably means skyscrapers) are nothing new in the City. On a lunchtime walk last week, I wandered into <a href=\"https://www.vedast.org.uk/about/\">St Vedast Foster Lane</a>, a church built by Christopher Wren not far from the FT's headquarters, whose windows — installed after it was gutted in the second world war — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Vedast_Foster_Lane\">use opaque glass</a> to hide the tall buildings near it.</p> <p>Morris, Bear, Bevis Marks' congregation and the <a href=\"https://www.planning2.cityoflondon.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&amp;keyVal=QJ0RIOFH0QH00\">700 people</a> who have registered objections to the online planning application (full disclosure: that includes me) are unlikely to give up if the corporation passes the plans — they want Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, or Robert Jenrick, secretary of state for housing, to call them in for review.</p> <p>The amiable but clearly frustrated rabbi says he would rather be focusing on his congregation than fighting the corporation. The City's actions betray an incomprehension of and insensitivity to what Bevis Marks is, he adds. “If it's important to protect heritage, then this is it: this is not just a historic building, it's literally living heritage in this spot.”</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:josh.spero@ft.com\"><em>josh.spero@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Josh Spero 2021 'Row over historic synagogue challenges City of London's post-Covid priorities ' FT.com 13 September.
