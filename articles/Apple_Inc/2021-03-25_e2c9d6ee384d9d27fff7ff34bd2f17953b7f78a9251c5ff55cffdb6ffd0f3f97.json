  "text": "<p>\n  Here are three new releases to stream this week: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Senior Moment' </p><p>\n  (Amazon, Apple TV, etc.) </p><p>\n  Among the projects on William Shatner's plate is a new movie, a hologram, and an autobiographical album that he says has put him in the \"midst of the most creative period of my life.\" Monday he turned 90. </p><p>\n  \"I'm excited,\" says the former Captain James T. Kirk in an interview. \"If I get tired, I think: Am I dying? I can't die now, I've got too much work.\" </p><p>\n  In \"Senior Moment,\" a new romantic comedy out Friday in select theaters  and available to rent on Amazon, Apple TV and other platforms, Mr. Shatner plays a dirty old man who pals around with Christopher Lloyd and falls for Jean Smart. Mr. Shatner's Victor Martin is a retiree who faces a crossroads when his license is revoked for driving his beloved Porsche too fast, too recklessly, too many times. Mr. Shatner says it's a character that not only he relates to, but he thinks everyone will at some point in their life. </p><p>\n  \"He's got to find another way of living out the rest of his life,\" Mr. Shatner says. \"And as a result of that problem, of not having his driver's license, he eventually finds love and companionship with someone else, which he wouldn't have gotten or looked for if his license hadn't been taken from him. It is a perfect example, by wonderful writers, of human beings having a problem that we think is insurmountable, but turn left or turn right, don't be stopped by the problem. The ideal thing is to use the impetus of that problem and go the third way. Shouldn't you lead your life that way?\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Invincible' </p><p>\n  (Amazon Prime Video) </p><p>\n  Robert Kirkman, co-creator of \"The Walking Dead\" comic book, watched the world he created for the page become a cultural touchstone as a live-action series. But when he went to adapt his comic book series, \"Invincible,\" for the screen, he knew it had to be drawn. </p><p>\n  \"Invincible,\" which premieres Friday, is the story of the teenage son of a superhero learning to use his own powers. The series visits Mars, features hundreds of characters and has as many as three alien invasions in a single episode -- which is much more manageable in animation. As is the incredible amount of violence, which Mr. Kirkman says is essential to the story. </p><p>\n  Mr. Kirkman says he wanted to show the consequences of a world in which superheroes exist: They fight each other, they destroy things, and there is significant collateral damage, something he says is usually glossed over in superhero comics and movies. \"If you have a two-hour Superman movie, you want to feel great when Superman wins at the end,\" says Mr. Kirkman. \"You don't want to have to worry about the apartment building that collapsed during the fight and all the people that were in it.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'The Irregulars' </p><p>\n  (Netflix) </p><p>\n  \"The Irregulars\" is at least the second title to launch on Netflix in the past six months that takes place in the world of Sherlock Holmes. Last September brought the release of \"Enola Holmes,\" about the teenage sister of her famous crime-solving brother. </p><p>\n  \"The Irregulars,\" created by Tom Bidwell, centers around a group of teens living on the margins in Victorian-era London. They are approached by a dismissive Dr. Watson (Royce Pierreson) who enlists them to help him solve a supernatural case. The crew is led by the street-savvy Bea, played by Thaddea Graham, who is also charged with looking after her sister, Jessie (Darci Shaw), a member of the group who has special powers and challenges. </p><p>\n  Ms. Graham says one thing that drew her to the role was playing a young, female protagonist whose main purpose isn't a romantic one. \"The main relationship in her life . . . is the one that she has with her sister,\" she says. \"Although we have romantic elements in the show, that's not what our show's about. It's about working together as a team and kind of finding your own family and who you are inside, rather than: Oh, I really fancy you because you're really good-looking.\" </p><p></p>",
