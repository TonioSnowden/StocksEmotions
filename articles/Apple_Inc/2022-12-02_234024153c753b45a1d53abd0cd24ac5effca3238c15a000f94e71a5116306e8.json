  "text": "<p>I was intrigued by Mark Vanhoenacker's enthusiastic endorsement of his iPad and its role in the cockpit, almost like having a second co-pilot (View from the Cockpit, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a23bcb5-b96b-4d64-8fac-8b53e474dba5\">Travel</a>, November 12).</p> <p>However, I found that the word “crash” was conspicuous by its absence — not a plane crash, of course, but the possibility of his iPad crashing. What happens then? Does he have the back-up printed manuals somewhere under his seat? </p> <p>I also wonder about musicians who are increasingly using foot-activated iPads. What's their back-up — an exceptional memory I presume.</p> <p><strong>Morris Zand</strong><br><em>Geneva, Switzerland</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: If pilots rely on iPads, what happens if they crash?'
