  "text": "<p>The first Soviet workers to descend into Moscow's metro stations in 1935 waited on platforms that were more like “palatial halls” and rode in carriages that were “all of one class: the highest”, according to satirists Ilya Ilf and Evgeny Petrov. The stations' opulent architecture — which, by one estimate, involved more marble than was used in the entire last five decades of tsarist Russia — was “socialist both in form and in execution”, they wrote, so “the hours a Muscovite spends underground will not be a burden to him. Imagine — underground it's pleasant, beautiful, even comfortable.”</p> <p>Ilf and Petrov, who had just returned from a trip to the US, may have been duty-bound to write that Stalin's metro was “immeasurably better . . . than London, Paris and Berlin”, but they were not wrong either. With its 276 stations, and trains arriving almost every minute, Moscow's metro is one of the world's busiest, handling 2.6 billion passengers in 2019; a major tourist attraction thanks to its imposing neoclassical and brutalist stations, mosaics and sculptures extolling heroic Soviet workers and promising a bright communist future; and, as the writer Owen Hatherley has argued, the one area where “the practice of the Soviet Union was vastly superior to that of the west”.</p> <p>Photographer Tomer Ifrah's series from Moscow and six other former Soviet cities captures how the metros set the mundanity of a commute against a grandeur at once lost in the past and set on capturing a brighter future. My commute when I first moved to Moscow ended at Kievskaya Koltsevaya, perhaps the grandest of them all, decked with Renaissance-style mosaics portraying the history of Ukraine.</p> <p>Nikita Khrushchev, the future Soviet premier who supervised the system's construction, wrote that its builders thought of it as “something almost supernatural . . . It's probably easier to contemplate space flights today than it was for us to contemplate the construction of the Moscow metro in the early 1930s.” The metro retains its science-fiction appeal, most notably in <em>Metro 2033</em>, a wildly popular novel and series of video games in which the remains of humanity retreat underground after a nuclear war, turning the metro into a civilisation unto itself.</p> <p>In a bid to prove a better world under communism was possible, the USSR exported the metro to its colonial “republics” and the eastern bloc, where builders adapted its architecture to local styles ranging from avant-garde abstraction in Ukraine to orientalism in Uzbekistan. More recently, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin has introduced comforts ranging from WiFi and USB ports to clean toilets and Apple Pay — while opening new stations at a breakneck pace.</p> <p>The best glimpse of that brighter future, however, came during the 2018 World Cup, when raucous groups of fans from as far away as Mexico and Japan mingled with bemused locals, turning the usually silent carriages into a kind of underground carnival. It still seems slightly shocking to recall the riot police at the exit, who helpfully offered directions in recently learnt&#xa0;English.</p> <p>Like the metro's original promise, that future now seems a long way off. In late January, Moscow and St Petersburg shut off entire swaths of their centres to stop protesters gathering, turning the stations over to riot police in body armour and space helmets. Those weren't the cosmonauts that were promised. </p> <p><em>Max Seddon is the FT's Moscow correspondent</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
