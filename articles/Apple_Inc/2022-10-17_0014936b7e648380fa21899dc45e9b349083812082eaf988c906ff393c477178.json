  "title": "Kanye West to buy extreme ‘free speech' app Parler",
  "text": "<p>Controversial rapper Kanye West has agreed to buy Parler, a would-be Twitter competitor whose extreme stance on free speech led to it being banned from Apple and Google's app stores and Amazon Web Services in the wake of last year's US Capitol riot. </p> <p>Parler's parent company, Parlement Technologies, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ye-formerly-known-as-kanye-west-to-acquire-parler-platform-301650579.html\">announced</a> the unexpected acquisition on Monday, without disclosing financial details. The Nashville-based business said it had struck an “agreement in principle” with West, who has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1bf4cda0-c836-448f-b7a9-ec6bb466e9e1\">changed his name</a> to Ye, and that the deal was expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022. </p> <p>West was briefly suspended from Twitter and Instagram earlier this month after making comments that were ruled <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-63198991\">anti-Semitic</a>. After the offensive posts were deleted he was allowed to return to the platforms, where he has tens of millions of followers. </p> <p>“In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,” West said in a press release issued by Parler. The artist has not posted about the deal from his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest\">verified account</a> on Twitter. </p> <p>The Parler <a href=\"https://parler.com/kanye/\">profile</a> that Parlement identified as West's, which appears to have been set up as recently as Monday, had attracted 5,000 followers by late afternoon in London and had not yet posted. </p> <p>Parlement chief executive George Farmer said the deal would “change the way the world thinks about free speech” and means West “will never have to fear being removed from social media again”. </p> <p>Parler was set up in 2018 as a challenger to existing social media platforms, which some US conservatives and far-right supporters alleged had become biased against them. Other alternative social media platforms include former US president Donald Trump's Truth Social app, GETTR, which was set up by former Trump adviser Jason Miller, and Rumble, a free speech video platform with backing from venture capitalists Peter Thiel and JD Vance. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Elon Musk, a self-declared “free speech absolutist”, has agreed to buy Twitter, pledging to relax its content moderation rules. </p> <p>Farmer, a former hedge fund partner and candidate for the UK's Brexit party, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/261fecd4-715f-4b90-a7fa-57d7d4013788\">took over</a> as head of Parler in May last year after his predecessor, John Matze, was fired after disagreements with its key backer, Republican mega-donor Rebekah Mercer. </p> <p>Farmer's wife, rightwing commentator Candace Owens, appeared with West at his fashion show in Paris earlier this month. Both wore T-shirts with the controversial phrase “White Lives Matter”, an apparent critique on the Black Lives Matter movement. </p> <p>Parler was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98c83613-18e9-427d-b41c-76176dcedf94\">allowed back</a> on to Apple's App Store in April 2021 after being kicked off the previous January for hosting rule-breaking content, including calls for violence in the days leading up to the Capitol protest in January 2021. However, it only returned to Google Play, the app store for Android smartphones, last month. </p> <p>In September, Parlement said it had raised a $16mn funding round, taking its total funding to $56mn. At the same time it acquired a cloud infrastructure company, offering an alternative to providers such as Amazon Web Services, which had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b567358-951a-4a86-ac7e-88fd1bfbad34\">denied Parler hosting services</a> in the wake of the Capitol riots. </p> <p>However it is less popular than other niche rivals; according to data.ai, the platform had 983,000 monthly active users in the first half of the year, compared with 2.4mn Truth Social users. </p> <p>When West started posting on Twitter again earlier this month after a long hiatus, he was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1578769394536452097\">greeted</a> by the social media company's putative acquirer Musk: “Welcome back to Twitter, my friend!”</p><p>Source: Tim Bradshaw in London and Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 2022 'Kanye West to buy extreme ‘free speech' app Parler' FT.com 17 October.
