  "text": "<p>But Democrats are dumping money into New Hampshire to besmirch Mr. Morse as \"another sleazy politician.\" One ad says his campaign is run by lobbyists, one of whom once \"worked for a Chinese company owned by a Communist Party official.\" Also, the Chinese official knows a guy who was a dogsitter for Kevin Bacon, for those who recall that six-degree party game. Why run this attack ad in a primary?</p><p>The answer is that Democrats want Republicans to pass over Mr. Morse and nominate Don Bolduc, who has a history of flirting with conspiracy theories. He told NH Journal in May last year that bad voting machines had tampered with the 2020 election results. \"It's not a fair process,\" he said, \"when a foreign company owns machines that count our votes.\"</p><p>WMUR reported in 2020 that Mr. Bolduc, a retired general, said Covid-19 was probably created by China as an attempt at population control. \"The virus was designed to get the younger generation sick and designed to have a fatal effect on our older generation,\" he said.</p><p>By one estimate, Democrats have spent more than $40 million helping 2020 election skeptics win GOP primaries, even while fretting about them as a \"threat to democracy.\" They're happy to gamble on that threat because their real concern is power, not democracy. It's obvious, if hypocritical, why Democrats want to manipulate inattentive Republicans into picking Mr. Bolduc. Less obvious is why Republicans would go along.</p>",
