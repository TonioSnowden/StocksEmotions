  "text": "<p>Should it be surprising that a Wikipedia entry titled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_revolution\">“2011 Egyptian Revolution”</a> was prepared for publication the day before protests began in Cairo's Tahrir Square? </p> <p>An intriguing but inconclusive new book takes a fresh look at the online encyclopedia that anyone can edit through the lens of a single article, and finds reason to question contemporary assumptions about what has been dubbed “the last best place on the internet”.</p> <p>Heather Ford, a South African internet activist turned academic, has spent 10 years studying the entry covering the Egyptian uprisings on Wikipedia. In the process, she met many of its authors (or “editors”, as they are known on the platform where original research is the equivalent to original sin) — from a Cairo liberal on the inside of events, to an agoraphobic US college graduate for whom stewardship of this slice of history proved “a turning point”. </p> <p>Ford combines her original and captivating research with forensic study of the site's technical logs and talk pages, dissecting the edit wars that followed the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/280e21c0-35da-11e0-b67c-00144feabdc0\"> resignation of President Hosni Mubarak</a>. She chronicles the unspooling euphoria of the subsequent years reflected in the article's slow decay, as the hive mind “buzzes away to other pages”, to be gradually replaced by bots scouring the article for dead links and mining it for data.</p> <p><em>Writing the Revolution</em> evokes two themes that together encompass practically every contemporary anxiety about truth and technology: how humans create knowledge, and how machines manipulate it. We privilege Wikipedia content, writes Ford, because we believe it is a product of mass consensus, what the journalist James Surowiecki first dubbed in 2004 “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wisdom-Crowds-Many-Smarter-Than/dp/0349116059\">the wisdom of crowds”.</a> And we trust that its editors adhere to strict policies, the main ones being that articles should present a neutral point of view, and that all contestable claims within them should be reliably sourced. </p> <p>In an age of hyper-awareness around subjectivity and disinformation, these beliefs are reassuring. Yet through revealing key points in the history of the Egyptian revolution article, Ford shows just how vulnerable the Wikipedia process is to the distortions of power and influence.</p> <p>Wikipedia content is further privileged, she writes, because it is encoded as structured data about objects in the world and their relationships to one another. This transforms it into machine-readable data, meaning it can be digested by the algorithms that power the products of major commercial players, from Google's Knowledge Graph (the fact boxes that appear next to Google search results), to Apple's virtual assistant Siri. </p> <p>This, says Ford, is “rocket fuel” for the truths thrashed out on Wikipedia, that sees them propelled beyond the website's millions of daily readers and into the orbit of the billions of people who use search and voice assistants. For Ford, the most worrying result of this land-grab by the machines is that facts now travel further than their contexts and sources, and the opacity of machine learning means that even those motivated to double-check them can't always trace the route back.</p> <p>Ford's writing is highly engaging. Her tenderness for the Wikipedians who people her story means that she never condemns them, even as she questions how their motives fit within Wikipedia policy. As a piece of ethnography, the book should sit alongside Georgina Born's 2004 study of the BBC, <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/356947/uncertain-vision-by-georgina-born/9780099587262\"><em>Uncertain Vision</em></a>, a work, like this one, that looks behind the curtain and reveals the recognisably human and fallible activity powering a great cultural institution.</p> <p>But Ford never quite succeeds in reconciling her two major themes. In places, it feels like she fudges set-piece critiques of artificial intelligence to fit her narrative. She states early on that she set out with this work to “break” Wikipedia. By her own admission she fails to do so.</p> <p><em>Writing the Revolution</em> is neither evangelical tract nor dystopian diatribe — and for that quality alone, it stands out. Ford's work spans a period in which our attitudes to technology have reversed polarities. In 2011, the world was excited about Twitter and Facebook revolutions; a decade later, we dread the distorting effect of social media's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43980f9c-0f5b-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745\">“surveillance capitalism”</a>.</p> <p>Across roughly the same time, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales has gone from describing it at a conference in 2008 as “subversive” (at the Wikimania conference in Egypt in 2008) to telling the UK parliament last year that it was “old-fashioned”. Perhaps, in the end, it is possible to be old fashioned and subversive at the same time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Uk0DnL\"><strong>Writing the Revolution:</strong></a><strong> Wikipedia and the Survival of Facts in the Digital Age</strong>, by Heather Ford, <em>MIT Press $25, 184 pages</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on</em> <em>Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Becky Hogge 2022 'Writing the Revolution — Wikipedia and the online battle over facts' FT.com 3 November.
