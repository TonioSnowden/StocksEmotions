  "title": "A near-term pullback, then the third bubble in 100 years is coming, says strategist. Here's how to get ready.",
  "text": "<p>After the “worst inflation call in history” and its credibility shattered, Chair Jerome Powell will need to take the reins hard, says Allianz's chief adviser Mohamed El-Erian. So we'll see if a potentially sterner Fed knocks the S&amp;P 500, which glided to a new high on Friday despite nosebleed consumer prices, off the Santa rally path.</p><p>On to our call of the day from a team at Stifel, led by Barry Bannister, warning of another bubble for the ages, thanks to “poor monetary and fiscal decisions since COVID-19.”</p><p>And maybe enjoy any Santa rally while it lasts, as the team sees a near-term correction taking the S&amp;P 500 toward the low 4,000s by the first quarter of next year. And then…</p><p>“Later in 2022-23E, we believe the ‘behind-the-curve' Fed might create the third bubble in 100 years, by 2023 to 6,750 for the S&amp;P 500 (Nasdaq [approximately] 25,000),” said the Stifel team.</p><p>“Populism (which the Fed and Treasury seemingly embrace) leads to poor choices and even worse outcomes. Rate repression may again create a bubble that bursts (always do), followed by a lost decade,” it said.</p><p>It said investors should look to history for proof this can happen. The S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 20% in the third quarter of 1998 before the dot-com bubble burst in 1999-2000. A “late arriving” Fed tightening from the second-half of 1999 to the first half of the next year couldn't stop it, said Bannister and the team.</p><p>“The same happened in the Roaring '20s, with a -10.7% mid_Dec-1928 drop as rates rose before the Oct.-1929 crash,” the strategists added.</p><p>The only way to prevent such a bubble would be for the Fed to heed its own financial stability report, where it warned over elevated risk appetite among retail investors&#xa0;and high equity and real estate valuations, and “tilt hawkish.”</p><p>“Still, policy may arrive too late, and if the market goes ‘risk-on' with a falling Equity Risk Premium and if the 10Y Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) yield remains repressed at -1.0% due to global central banks, a P/E [price-earnings] convexity bubble in 2022-2023E may occur,” they said.</p><p>While the big one may be a way off, they offer a near-term survival guide. Bannister and his team said if both the S&amp;P 500 and commodities weaken simultaneously — they expect that due to dollar strength, a China growth slowdown, Fed exit signals and tighter global liquidity —investors can take refuge in S&amp;P 500 defensives. So healthcare, consumer staples, utilities and telecommunications are the safety spots of choice, for now.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>We've got Monday mergers and acquisitions. Pfizer PFE is buying Arena Pharma ARNA in a $6.7 billion deal. Software group SPX Flow FLOW has agreed to a $3.8 billion buyout from Lone Funds.</p><p>South African researchers say a two-shot course of Pfizer and BioNTech's BNTX COVID-19 vaccine is about 23% effective against the omicron coronavirus variant, but may still prevent serious disease. Pfizer also got upgraded to buy at UBS, which sees $50 billion in COVID franchise sales next year.</p><p>Peloton PTON has fired back lightning fast at a plot twist in the “Sex and the City” reboot that was partly blamed for some stock selling, with a new ad featuring actor Chris Noth…back on his bike.</p><p>Monday is quiet on the data front, but the rest of the week is busy enough with retail sales and some manufacturing gauges. The Fed's two-day meeting kicks off Tuesday. Here's a preview.</p><p>Iron-ore prices have been rising on speculation China will provide fiscal stimulus in early 2022, after the country's top officials said at a weekend meeting that they want to stabilize the economy.</p><p>Celebrity chefs such as José Andrés are among those providing aid to Kentucky, which bore the brunt of a series of deadly and devastating tornadoes that hit multiple states this weekend.</p><p>The chart</p><p>Betting on bitcoin? A survey conducted by Jim Reid and other strategists at Deutsche Bank finds that the older crowd is less optimistic about more gains than the younger crowd.</p><p>The markets</p><p>Stock futures ES00YM00NQ00 are higher, but have pared those gains. Oil CL00 is lower, it was a mixed day for Asian stocks, but Europe XX:SXXP is perking up, while bitcoin BTCUSD and other cryptocurrencies are softer. The beaten-down Turkish lira USDTRY was getting crushed again after Standard &amp; Poor's warned of a downgrade.
