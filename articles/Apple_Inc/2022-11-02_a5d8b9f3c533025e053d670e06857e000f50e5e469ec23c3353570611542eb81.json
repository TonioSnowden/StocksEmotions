  "title": "Chinese iPhone City Locks Down to Curb Foxconn Covid Crisis; Local governor urges tighter restrictions after weekslong struggle to contain the virus leads to mounting worker desertions",
  "text": "<p>The lockdown comes even though Foxconn introduced a closed-loop arrangement more than two weeks ago at its main Zhengzhou facility, the world's largest assembly site for Apple Inc.'s iPhones. Hundreds of thousands of workers could only travel between their homes or sleeping quarters and designated areas of the factory. Employees told The Wall Street Journal that many of them were confined to their dorms or bussed to quarantine facilities away from the plant, with some complaining of inadequate supplies of food and other essentials.</p><p>Many workers, scared of catching Covid, refused to return to the production lines, some escaping from the site, the Journal reported.</p><p>In recent days, videos geo-tagged near the Foxconn site have shown groups of people walking along highways and through farm fields with their luggage. After those images went viral on social media, Foxconn said it would provide transportation to any workers wanting to go home.</p><p>On Friday, Foxconn also increased bonuses for workers. Those turning up every working day between Oct. 26 and Nov. 11 would receive free meals and a total of 1,500 yuan, or about $200. Shortly after, the company quadrupled its daily incentive and extended it through the rest of November, with the potential bonus reaching around 15,000 yuan—about one-quarter of the average annual salary in the city.</p><p>The company also has plans to shift some production to other factories in China, the Journal reported citing people familiar.</p><p>When asked about the impact of the seven-day closure of the industrial park, a Foxconn spokesman said only that it was continuing closed-loop operations. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Henan reported 359 new locally transmitted Covid cases for Tuesday—all but one of which were in Zhengzhou—out of a nationwide tally of more than 2,600, according to official data. While Henan's new daily infections have jumped more than 10-fold over the past week, they remain below those in southern Guangdong province, Foxconn's China base and where Foxconn operates other factories assembling Apple products.</p><p>Chinese iPhone City Locks Down to Curb Foxconn Covid Crisis</p>",
