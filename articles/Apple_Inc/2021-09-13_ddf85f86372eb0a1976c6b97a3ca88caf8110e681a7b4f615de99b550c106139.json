  "text": "<p>Hello readers! I've returned from summer holiday/book leave and I'm ready to wade back into the Swamp with all of you. Thanks again to the many wonderful colleagues who covered for me.</p> <p>I started last week by taking my first overseas trip since Covid began, to Ukraine. There, I attended the Yalta European Strategy summit, my first in-person conference since the beginning of the pandemic. There were many takeaways, but here are my top five:&#xa0;</p> <ol>  <li><p>The tripolar world is heating up. Perhaps the most interesting panel was on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which became operational last week. As Swampians will know, this extremely contentious project, which will pump Russian gas into Germany bypassing Ukraine, is no longer being opposed by the Biden administration, though Amos Hochstein, the US state department's senior adviser for energy security, tried to quell anxieties in the mostly Ukrainian and European audience by assuring everyone that the White House thought the project was actually a terrible idea. That said, the US has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a7f3282-2db5-47dc-84d5-1c50f5295d8d\">waived further sanctions</a> on the project, so it's a&#xa0;<em>fait accompli</em>. The White House is clearly trying to appease the Germans and repair relations with allies that were strained by former president Donald Trump. But there's no getting around the fact that it's a terrible foreign policy conundrum for everyone involved. Germany and Ukraine are now both more vulnerable to Russian president Vladimir Putin's energy politics (though Germans claim they'll stand up to him if the time comes — hmm . . .). But the US is in the really terrible position of making yet another ally, Ukraine, feel that it has been pushed under the bus. What's more, nobody has a clear idea of what the US would do if Russia decided to use the new leverage to make it hard for Ukraine to charge gas transit fees, restrict Ukrainian energy exports, or worse. Although it will probably take months for the pipeline to come online, this feels like a disaster waiting to happen. Watch this space.</p></li>  <li><p>Allies have been extremely shaken by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. That's no surprise, but the depth of fear and feeling was really notable. Bernard-Henri Lévy, the French philosopher who went to Afghanistan in 2002 at the behest of the French government to interview Afghans and help shape French policy in the region, gave a brief statement, saying that he'd <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/18/mujahideen-resistance-taliban-ahmad-massoud/\">spoken with Ahmad Massoud</a>, the National Resistance Front leader and son of the famed mujahideen leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who told him to tell allies to be worried, very worried, about US reliability. Again, no surprise, but it was one of many fretful moments that led to larger discussions about the moral position of the US and the West, and whether or not the US in particular could possibly lead any coalition of democracies to broader economic and political alliances in the 21st&#xa0;century.</p></li>  <li><p>To that point, New Yorker writer Masha Gessen, a Russia expert, showed up and gave some powerful thoughts about why the US should move to thinking about sanctions in moral, rather than economic terms, in the future. See their piece on the topic <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-moral-case-for-sanctions-against-russia\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Their take chimed with something I've been thinking a lot about, which is that although I believe the US was right to leave Afghanistan, the new sense of moral ambiguity in foreign policy is not only worrisome to allies, it's leading to major rifts at home, which only increases the sense of existential dread that Americans feel about their place in the world, which may in turn increase inwardness and isolationism. Ugh.</p></li>  <li><p>And finally, on a much, much lighter note, I couldn't help but observe that many of the Ukrainian women I met looked like supermodels (ones that came equipped with PhDs and spoke multiple languages to boot), and most of the (much older) men in attendance did not. I spoke to one young woman who was surprised to find that discrimination in hiring was illegal in the US. At least we still have the moral high ground in something. Get me to a safe space!&#xa0;</p></li> </ol> <p>Ed, what's your takeaway from all this? And what's the most important thing I missed over the last six weeks?</p> <h1>Recommended Reading</h1> <ul>  <li><p>I was struck and saddened by the latest numbers showing that young men are <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-university-fall-higher-education-men-women-enrollment-admissions-back-to-school-11630948233\">dropping out of college in record numbers</a>. As the mother of a 14-year-old boy who has struggled with the conventional education system (he is now thriving in a private school geared towards boys, which focuses more on kinetic learning, and allows the kids to move and be outside the classroom) I think this is a crisis issue that needs a lot more policy thought. It also underscores the desperate need to update secondary and tertiary education for the 21st&#xa0;century. Having kids sit for hours in rows for rote learning makes absolutely no sense.</p></li>  <li><p>Columbia professor Jonathan Knee's well-argued <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/04/business/dealbook/network-effects.html\">opinion piece</a> in the NYT's DealBook section challenges the idea that platform giants can't be easily disrupted. I think it depends on the platform, though. Netflix, which he focuses on here, is a lot more vulnerable than, say, Apple or Google.</p></li>  <li><p>Young Americans seem to be turning European, with a quarter of highly educated women having their <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-college-educated-women-are-having-babies-outside-marriage-11630954800\">first child before marriage</a>. I wonder if this goes hand in hand with the nascent trend among coastal Millennials towards <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/22/how-polyamorists-and-polygamists-are-challenging-family-norms\">communal living and relationships</a>?</p></li> </ul> <h1>Edward Luce responds</h1> <p>Rana, your trip sounded both instructive and Bond-esque (something about Ukrainian supermodels with PhDs). I doubt you've missed anything&#xa0;in the past six weeks, so you will know it has been tumultuous. From a US domestic point of view, it contained two defiant, and even angry, addresses to the nation by Joe Biden — one defending his Afghanistan&#xa0;exit, and other taking off his gloves with the anti-vax crowd. I don't happen to agree with his first decision (not just the way it was executed) and I strongly applaud his new toughness on vaccines. But my opinion for these purposes is neither here nor there. What I noticed about both these addresses was Biden's defiance. Something has changed in him over the summer. Having given his bipartisan schtick a very generous airing, he appears to have concluded&#xa0;that it will not bear any fruit.&#xa0;</p> <p>We are not talking here about differences in ideology, or even a breakdown of civility, both of which are now long-term features of Washington DC. Biden had faith he could overcome those obstacles with his experience and personal relationships. None of Biden's qualities of goodwill or pragmatism offer befitting responses to a party that is trying to prolong and exacerbate a pandemic because it would damage the economic recovery and thus Biden. I wrote about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/884fda23-2f25-4a18-9fb9-4e509abc53d9\">Republican alliance with Covid-19</a> last week. In the last 14 days, Covid deaths in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html\">Florida and Texas</a>&#xa0;have accounted for a third of all US Covid deaths,&#xa0;and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/10/inescapable-overlap-pandemic-politics/\">14 of the top 18 states</a> for Covid&#xa0;deaths per capita&#xa0;voted for Donald Trump. You can cut deals with your opponents on tax rates and spending — though Republicans look set to unanimously oppose Biden's social budget bill. You cannot split the difference on a pandemic. I suspect Biden has realised that bipartisanship is impossible in these circumstances. If that means he's finally ready to take the tough decisions on vaccine mandates then this steelier new Biden is a welcome development.&#xa0;</p> <h1>Your feedback </h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/884fda23-2f25-4a18-9fb9-4e509abc53d9\"><strong>The Republican party: Covid-19's dependable ally</strong></a><strong>':</strong></p> <p>“I'm reminded of a political satirist who mentioned, ‘truth isn't political; lies are', yet those words ring so hollow now. I'm sympathetic to Ed's view that the espousal of fringe lies and the hypocrisy of contemporary Republican leadership — from the embrace of the ‘big lie', QAnon quackery and the downplaying of Covid's severity — will not be remembered well in history. I'm also in agreement that freedom must be redefined in today's political socialisation, which should never be used as a basis to defy public health orders and trample on the safety and security of others. Furthermore, I'm also sympathetic to Rana's view (who we're so happy to see back) that we are living in a ‘post-truth society' and an ‘era of decadence'. Misinformation and apathy have surely disconnected our worldview while a multitude of challenges demands attention at home.” — <em>Osiris Parikh, Beaverton, Oregon</em></p> <p><em>Catch up on previous Swamp Notes on </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/swamp-notes\"><em>FT.com</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Source: Rana Foroohar  2021 'Pipeline problems' FT.com 13 September.
