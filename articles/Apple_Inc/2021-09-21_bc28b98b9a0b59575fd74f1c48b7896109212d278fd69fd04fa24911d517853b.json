  "text": "<p>Key Takeaways</p><p>1. Check your phone's battery health.</p><p>You can check if Apple is slowing your phone. Go to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Health to see the battery's maximum capacity. If you need to replace your battery, a message will appear at the top of the page saying, \"Your battery's health is significantly degraded.\"</p><p>Out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacements through Apple cost up to $69, depending on your model. Independent shops generally don't offer much of a discount for battery replacements, so it's probably worth going through official channels. (Lithium-ion batteries can explode.)</p><p>Regardless of whether your phone is throttled, you can also turn off features—such as background app refresh and location services—to boost speeds. Enabling Reduce Motion in Accessibility can help, too.</p><p>2. Delete or move data to free up space.</p><p>Tired of those \"Storage Full\" pop-ups? Head to Settings &gt; General &gt; iPhone Storage to see what's taking up the most space.</p><p>You can manage apps' data right from this page. For example, tap Photos to review the videos taking up the most space, and swipe to the left on each video to delete. You can do the same with podcasts or streaming apps such as Netflix. You can also offload unused apps—this temporarily uninstalls the app but retains your data.</p><p>3. Replace your cracked screen.</p><p>Just be sure that any shop you hand over your phone—and your personal data—to is a reputable service provider that uses high-quality parts.</p><p>Read the full story by Nicole Nguyen here.</p><p>Here's How to Get the Most Out of an Older iPhone</p>",
