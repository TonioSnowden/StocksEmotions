  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Speaker Maker Sonos Needed to Crank It Up  ----  By Dan Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The pandemic was a mixed blessing for Sonos, but at least the global health crisis helped convince investors that the premium speaker maker has staying power. </p><p>\n  Between its initial public offering in mid-2018 and its fiscal year-end report on Nov. 19, 2020, Sonos's shares barely averaged a modest multiple of one times the company's forward sales. That was in keeping with the valuation purgatory Wall Street generally reserves for companies in the highly cyclical consumer technology hardware space. Sonos had the added burden of competing with the largest tech companies on the planet -- two of which were content to sell smart speakers at cut-rate prices to aggressively expand the market for their voice assistants. </p><p>\n  Sonos still competes with Amazon and Google in that category, and Apple joined the fray late last year with the uncharacteristically inexpensive HomePod mini, selling for $99. But Sonos still managed a sales surge in the latter half of 2020. That was helped by improved distribution of the company's products following retail disruption early in the pandemic, as well as homebound workers deciding to invest in quality sound systems. It also has managed to keep its average selling price well above the $200 mark. Investors have started tuning in; Sonos's share price has more than doubled since its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Nov. 19, and its valuation multiple has nearly tripled to about 2.9 times forward sales. </p><p>\n  It was a good time for the company to turn things up a notch. Sonos unveiled a new speaker Tuesday afternoon -- a $169 device called the Roam that targets the ultra-portable Bluetooth speaker segment. It used a virtual analyst meeting to raise its long-term financial targets. Sonos now expects to end its 2024 fiscal year with revenue of about $2.25 billion, implying average sales growth of about 13% annually. The company has averaged a little under 10% annual sales growth over the past five years. </p><p>\n  Sonos isn't hanging those expectations entirely on the Roam, but the new speaker does help expand the company's market into a new tier without sacrificing its premium image. The Bluetooth speaker segment is a wide-ranging category with prices that average around $98, according to estimates from Futuresource Consulting. But the Roam can still use a Wi-Fi connection while in the home, along with the Amazon and Google voice assistants available in other Sonos speakers. And the price disparity isn't as wide as it seems. Futuresource estimates that Samsung's JBL, Sony and Bose accounted for about 53% of Bluetooth speaker sales last year, and all have offerings priced similar to or higher than the Roam. </p><p>\n  Sonos will likely continue adding new products and services to expand its reach outside the home. The company confirmed Tuesday that it is working with Audi on a sound system for a coming SUV called the Q4 e-tron. Having shown it can compete well with giants in the home, the time is right for Sonos to take its show on the road. </p><p></p>",
