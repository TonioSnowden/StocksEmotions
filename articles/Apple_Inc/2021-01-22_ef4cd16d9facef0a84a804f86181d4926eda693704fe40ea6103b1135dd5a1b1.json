  "title": "Banking & Finance: Britain's IG to Buy U.S. Options Firm",
  "text": "<p>Founded in 1974 and listed on the London Stock Exchange, IG expanded over the years from its U.K. base to Europe, Australia and Asia. In the U.S., it owns Nadex, a small exchange for binary options, a type of exotic derivative contract.</p><p>Tastytrade, based in Chicago, caters to individuals seeking to trade options, with a brokerage arm called Tastyworks and a free online-video network featuring tutorials on trading strategies and interviews with veteran traders. About 900,000 people have registered for Tastytrade's content, the firm says.</p><p>Options are contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell shares at a specific price later in time. Traders can use options to hedge their portfolios from stock declines or make bets that indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 or individual companies will either go up or down in value.</p><p>The contracts can be risky. With certain strategies, investors can lose all of the money they invested, or even more. On the flip side, investors can enjoy outsize gains if their options bets prove correct.</p><p>The IG-Tastytrade deal comes as interest in options has surged among individual investors. Many Americans turned to trading stocks and options during the pandemic, as lockdowns and a shift toward remote working left millions at home with little to do. Intense volatility across financial markets, a move toward zero- or low-commission trades in the brokerage industry and trading apps such as Robinhood fueled the boom.</p><p>More than 7 billion stock options changed hands in 2020, up almost 60% from the prior year, according to Options Clearing Corp. data.</p><p>Many investors used options to bet on shares of technology companies and electric-vehicle makers that soared over the past year. Options on stocks including Apple Inc., Tesla Inc., electric-car maker NIO Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. have been wildly popular.</p><p>\"There's a new generation of retail traders entering the market,\" Kristi Ross, co-chief executive of Tastytrade, said. \"That's an opportunity for us to go in and make sure they're educated and informed.\"</p>",
