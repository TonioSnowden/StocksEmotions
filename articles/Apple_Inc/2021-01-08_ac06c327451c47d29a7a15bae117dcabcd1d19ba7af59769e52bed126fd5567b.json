  "text": "<p>Tesla's success has made Elon Musk the world's richest man. But Tesla's leadership in electric cars has serious competition, with Apple among the contenders. Hyundai Motors has confirmed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40cfd599-b2f6-469d-923f-9015e9cc46ab\">early stage discussions</a> with the US devices giant to produce self-driving electric cars. </p> <p>The tie-up with the South Korean carmaker is at a very early stage. Any Apple car is at least five years away from market. But investors are bullish. Hyundai's share price soared 19 per cent on Friday.&#xa0;Apple can bring huge financial, marketing and design muscle to the venture.</p> <p>“Project Titan” — Apple's electric car development plan — has been under way since 2014. But the smartphone specialist lacks the large-scale production capacity and the automotive technology to turn its designs and patents into cars. It needs an experienced partner.</p> <p>Hyundai is a good choice. It operates the world's largest integrated production facility with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8617355c-8b90-49dc-b1d9-aa68add5d286\">dedicated platform</a> for electric and hydrogen cars. It makes its own parts through subsidiaries. A vertically integrated supply chain should keep costs under control.</p> <p>The automaker has invested billions in driverless cars and solid state batteries. Autonomous driving functions launch on its cars next year. Hyundai claims to have almost 6 per cent of the world's electric vehicle market and plans to more than triple output of EVs to 560,000 by 2025.</p> <p>Cash-rich Apple could provide much-needed financial support. Hyundai's operating cash flow has only covered its investments twice since 2014 when 2020 estimates are included. </p> <p>There are obstacles to a tie-in. Apple might instead adopt an iPhone-style production system — outsourcing parts to contract manufacturers such as Canadian auto parts maker Magna and Taiwan's Foxconn. An Apple/Hyundai tie-up could cannibalise demand for Hyundai's own family of self-driving electric cars. </p> <p>Even after Friday's gains, Hyundai shares still languish below book value. The stock looks cheap. Hyundai is one of the few manufacturers positioned to control the full value chain of a high-growth smart electric car range. As such, the stock still offers affordable exposure to the eagerly awaited Apple&#xa0;car.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
