  "title": "SPAC Woos Spotify Rival Deezer --- Music streaming firm in talks to go public via Pinault-backed blank-check company",
  "text": "<p>Deezer is in talks to merge with Paris-listed I2PO SA, the people said. The blank-check company is backed by France's Pinault family, controlling shareholder of Gucci owner Kering, and Centerview Partners banker Matthieu Pigasse. The vehicle is headed by former WarnerMedia executive Iris Knobloch.</p><p>The deal, if finalized, could be announced in coming days, the people said. The valuation of the deal couldn't be learned.</p><p>The talks mark the second time Deezer has sought to go public since it was founded in 2007. The company previously abandoned plans for an initial public offering in 2015, after a fall in active listeners at internet radio operator Pandora Media Inc. triggered concerns about the outlook for streaming services. Pandora was subsequently acquired in 2018 by Sirius XM Holdings Inc. for $3 billion.</p><p>Since then, Deezer raised 160 million euros, equivalent to about $173 million, at a valuation of 1 billion euros in 2018 to help fund its expansion. Investors in that fundraising included Kingdom Holding Co., which is controlled by Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, and Access Industries, the industrial conglomerate founded by billionaire Len Blavatnik that controls Warner Music Group Corp.</p><p>The fortunes of the music business have also improved in recent years, with the growth of streaming revenues from services like Spotify and Apple Inc.'s Apple Music offsetting the decline in sales of physical music and downloads.</p><p>Streaming now accounts for more than 80% of recorded-music revenue in the U.S., according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Overall, the global record music industry's revenue grew by 18.5% last year -- more than double the average rate of the preceding four years, data from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry show.</p><p>Deezer, like some of its rivals, generates revenue from advertising on its free service as well as from its premium subscription service.</p><p>Among the challenges facing Deezer is stiff competition from Apple Music's and Amazon.com Inc.'s similar services, which benefit from their larger scale and alternative sources of revenue, allowing these tech giants to keep prices low versus their competitors.</p><p>At the end of June last year, Deezer had about 2% share of the global music streaming market measured by subscribers, according to Midia, a data provider. Spotify led the way with a 31% share, followed by 15% for Apple Music and 13% for Amazon Music.</p><p>Spotify listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018. The stock has come under pressure this year, falling about 40%, hurt in part by its decision not to issue financial guidance in February.</p><p>The Sweden-based company was rocked earlier this year by controversy surrounding Joe Rogan, an American podcaster who brings millions of listeners to the platform. Musicians including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell demanded Spotify remove their music from the service, arguing that Mr. Rogan was spreading misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>Major music labels that license songs to streaming platforms are also trying to cash in on the popularity of streaming. Warner Music floated in 2020 and Universal Music Group NV went public last year.</p><p>The Deezer SPAC deal comes as this kind of transaction has fallen out of favor in recent months, after a flurry of activity in the past two years. SPACs raise money by going public and then have a set period of time to hunt for an acquisition target. They can offer companies a quicker way to go public than the traditional IPO route. But many of the companies that have gone public have quickly fallen out of favor with investors because they have struggled to meet their business targets.</p><p>---</p><p>Sam Schechner contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
