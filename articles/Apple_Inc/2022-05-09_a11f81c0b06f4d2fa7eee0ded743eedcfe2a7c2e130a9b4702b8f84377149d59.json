  "title": "Match Sues Google Over App Store Payment Rules; Lawsuit challenges new policy requiring apps exclusively use Google billing system",
  "text": "<p>Match said Google had previously assured it that Match's dating apps, which include Tinder, Match and OkCupid, could use their own payment system for in-app purchases on Android.</p><p>But, Match said, it was later told that it must comply by June 1 with a new policy requiring all apps that sell digital goods and services to exclusively use Google Play Billing, or potentially be removed from the app store.</p><p>\"Ten years ago, Match Group was Google's partner,\" the company said in the lawsuit. \"We are now its hostage.\"</p><p>The Google Play Store \"is essentially the only viable mobile app distribution channel on smart devices running Android OS,\" and more than 90% of all downloads of Android apps occur through the Google Play Store, Match said in a statement.</p><p>Google disputed the allegations, saying that, like any business, it charges for its services, which include protection from fraud and abuse in their apps.</p><p>\"This is just a continuation of Match Group's self-interested campaign to avoid paying for the significant value they receive from the mobile platforms they've built their business on,\" a Google spokesperson said.</p><p>Google and rival Apple Inc. have faced lawsuits and regulatory probes in multiple countries around their requirements that apps listed on their app marketplaces use in-house payment systems that take cuts of up to 30% of in-app sales in most cases.</p><p>Earlier this year, Spotify Technology SA reached an agreement with Google to offer an alternative payment method within its app for users. Google said at the time that Spotify was the first of a small number of developers to participate in a pilot program allowing alternative billing options.</p><p>Match's apps are eligible to pay 15% on Google Play for digital subscriptions, the lowest rate among major app platforms, Google said Monday. It added that the company has other ways to offer its apps for download for its users outside of Google Play.</p><p>Match Chief Executive Shar Dubey called the lawsuit \"a measure of last resort.\"</p><p>\"We tried, in good faith, to resolve these concerns with Google, but their insistence and threats to remove our brands' apps from the Google Play Store by June 1 has left us no choice but to take legal action,\" Ms. Dubey said.</p><p>Write to Talal Ansari at talal.ansari@wsj.com</p><p>Match Sues Google Over App Store Payment Rules</p>",
