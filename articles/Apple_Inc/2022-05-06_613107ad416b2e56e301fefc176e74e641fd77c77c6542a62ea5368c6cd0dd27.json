  "text": "<p>* Useful \"between the categories\" sizing</p><p>* Comfortable suspension</p><p>Cons</p><p>* Ready to be updated</p><p>* Unremarkable engine</p><p>* Ride quality compromised by the larger wheel/tire combination</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* No major changes for 2022</p><p>Price: The 2022 Nissan Rogue Sport starts at $24,260.</p><p>Don't think the 2022 Nissan NSANY Rogue Sport is a sporty version of the Nissan Rogue compact SUV. This is a separate vehicle in its own right, slightly smaller than the Rogue yet larger than the Kicks subcompact crossover SUV. Car companies can't have too many SUVs in their portfolios, so in-between models like these are inevitable.</p><p>Another inevitability is the passing of time, which sees this generation of Rogue Sport coming to a conclusion. We're expecting Nissan to bring a new iteration for the 2023 model year. Until then, the 2022 Rogue Sport functions as an efficient small crossover SUV, but doesn't really have any qualities to make it shine.</p><p>2022 Nissan Rogue Sport pricing</p><p>Starting with a front-drive model in S trim, the 2022 Rogue Sport has a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $24,260, plus a destination charge. All-wheel drive is an extra $1,500 and is available with all three trim levels.</p><p>At the priciest end, SL trim starts at almost $29K. Adding options like premium paint, all-wheel drive and the Premium package pushes the price to around $33K.</p><p>Looking at the competition, the similarly sized (and far more engaging) Mazda CX-30 MZDAY starts at just over $22K and gains all-wheel drive as standard this year. The subcompact-yet-spacious Honda HR-V HMC is in the same fiscal ballpark. Potential buyers might also like to consider the Kia KR:000270 Seltos (from $22.7K), and the Hyundai HYMTF Kona (from $21K).</p><p>Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their new Rogue Sport. The Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-30 fare better with resale values, but the Rogue Sport is by no means a dud in this respect.</p><p>Driving the 2022 Nissan Rogue sport</p><p>First, the good news. The ride quality in general is forgiving and comfortable. The SL's 19-inch alloy wheels, however, make things a little harsher because the tires' sidewalls are smaller and therefore less pliable.</p><p>Now the not-so-good news. The suspension's kindness translates to a vagueness when going around corners. The steering is light, great for easing into parking spaces, but we'd prefer a little more substance while on the freeway.</p><p>Not that the 2022 Rogue Sport is going to be achieving high speeds. Small SUVs make an unhappy hunting ground for drivers seeking power. Most of them have around 140 horsepower or so, like this one. So overtaking takes a bit of planning and timing. Nor will anyone want to rev the engine for the sheer sonic delight. There isn't any.</p><p>Check out: 7 off-the-radar places worth stopping on a California road trip</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>Despite being bigger than a typical subcompact SUV, the 2022 Rogue Sport doesn't impress with its interior space. For example, rear legroom (33.4 inches) is only a little better than the smaller Nissan Kicks. While the Mazda CX-30, Honda HR-V and Kia Seltos all enjoy more.</p><p>The cargo area measures 22.9 cubic feet behind the split/folding rear seats, with 61.1 cubic feet when they're folded down. The two higher trims reduce those figures to 20 and 53.</p><p>That's still enough to beat the Mazda CX-30, but no 2022 Rogue Sport can beat the Honda HR-V or Kia Seltos in this regard. The SV and SL trims do have a Divide-N-Hide cargo system, however, that keeps items in place while driving.</p><p>Conditions up front are sufficiently spacious, and the Rogue Sport provides a nicely elevated driving position. The dashboard design is gimmick-free, with each trim deploying a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen. The system itself is easy to use but feels dated now, another reminder that this generation of Rogue Sport is winding down.</p><p>Read: Death to the car dealership — the Tesla sales model is poised to take over America</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>Let's move swiftly past the generic small crossover-SUV styling of the 2022 Rogue Sport and the corporate Nissan grille to concentrate on the rear doors. They're quite long, creating a nice large aperture. This is great for dignified entries and exits, while also providing welcome wiggle room for fraught parents trying to strap their little bundles of joy into child seats.</p><p>Nissan has performed a similar trick with the liftgate, making the luggage area easy to access. A chromed plate protecting the top of the rear bumper is optional. It's well worth considering if there's going to be a lot of loading and unloading in a new Rogue Sport's future.</p><p>Also see: The 25 bestselling SUVs</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Intelligent around-view monitorWorking on the assumption that more information is always desirable, then knowing what's going on around the entire vehicle is probably worth the extra money. This 360-degree camera system is part of the optional Technology package offered with the mid-range SV trim, or standard in the top SL model.</p><p>Easy fill tire alertHow much air should you put in the tires? This standard feature removes the worry by activating an alert once the proper pressure is achieved.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>Available in S, SV, and SL trims, the 2022 Rogue Sport small SUV comes standard with several driver assistance features. As well as the expected forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, there's a pedestrian detection function and automatic braking in reverse gear.</p><p>Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is also included, plus rear parking sensors. These items are often optional in rival vehicles.</p><p>The rest of S trim has things like 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights with automatic high beams, LED daytime running lights/taillights, cloth upholstery, rear door alert, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, satellite radio, and a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen. Not bad at all, but we would pay another $1,570 for the next-up SV model.</p><p>For the extra equipment, naturally, but also to qualify for the optional SV Technology package.</p><p>Don't miss: How much more gas is costing for every type of vehicle — see how yours stacks up</p><p>Factory options</p><p>SV trim is more civilized, with keyless entry/ignition, remote start, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated/leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated front seats, 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat, illuminated vanity mirrors, and fog lights. The Technology package ($1,850) adds adaptive cruise control with steering assistance, memory settings for the driver's seat and side mirrors, a 360-degree camera system, and (not really tech-y) simulated leather seating surfaces.</p><p>SL trim has some of those tech features as standard, like the 360-degree camera system and adaptive cruise control. It also comes with real leather seating surfaces, 4-way power-adjustable front passenger seat, road sign recognition, navigation, and 19-inch alloy wheels.</p><p>An optional Premium package ($2,280) for the SL version brings a powered moonroof, upgraded LED headlights, self-dimming rearview mirror, garage door opener, memory settings for the driver's seat and side mirrors, and an 8-speaker Bose audio system.</p><p>Other options for all three versions include a chrome rear bumper protector, premium paint, roof rail crossbars, and illuminated kick plates.</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>Every 2022 Rogue Sport is propelled by 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque from a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. An automatic transmission sends this modest amount of energy to a standard front-wheel-drive (FWD) setup, or to an optional all-wheel-drive (AWD) system.</p><p>These fuel economy estimates from the Environmental Protection Agency relate to 2021, but we expect 2022's to be the same.</p><p>2.0-liter inline-4141 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm147 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/32 (FWD), 24/30 (AWD)</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com.</p><p>The 2022 Nissan Rogue Sport: An efficient small crossover, but ready for an update</p>",
