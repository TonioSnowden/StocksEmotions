Although the overall result was another sign that the bloc's output <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0717e4b8-3b69-4b3c-9ba8-bd9d62707f2d\">would contract this winter</a>, there was some encouraging news on supply chain problems and cost pressures easing.</p> <p>However, there were few signs of optimism in a separate survey from the European Round Table for Industry. It showed that a third of the biggest industrial companies expected to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ee7f45a-91af-4d1b-b87c-22ed54adda08\">stop or scale back operations</a> because of record energy prices and slowing demand.</p> <p>Businesses have also shown concern that incentives in the US $369bn green technology initiative (aka the Inflation Reduction Act) could<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59a8d135-3477-4d0a-8d12-20c7ef94be07\"> divert investment away from Europe</a>.</p> <p>The PMI score for the UK of 48.3, although broadly unchanged from October, was the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65cd5dda-a5ea-411a-b0ef-08caee388b47\">fourth consecutive reading below 50</a>, with new orders falling at the fastest pace in almost two years, pointing to a deepening recession. Survey panellists cited the cost of living crisis, the Ukraine war, rising export challenges, higher borrowing costs and fiscal tightening. &#xa0;</p> <p>Many respondents cited Brexit-related problems. Cips chief economist John Glen said: “The Covid veil, now almost completely lifted, has revealed the challenges still faced by exporters struggling with customs and paperwork challenges and other Brexit constraints putting off overseas customers.”</p> <p>Manufacturing company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e70da08a-16c2-4caa-96b6-0d10c6471d30\">Johnson Matthey</a> is the country's latest casualty of soaring inflation and energy prices, today announcing cuts of up to 15 per cent in its senior management jobs.</p> <p>The UK PMI result follows yesterday's forecast from the OECD which said the country would be the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6b84faf-f556-4fdd-ac27-65c2d514aa2f\">worst performer in the G20 bar Russia</a> over the next two years, with GDP falling 0.4 per cent in 2023. &#xa0;</p> <p>The headline <a href=\"https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/d9ef5b8294e24a6f876372b65141b93e\">US PMI reading</a> fell from 48.2 to a three-month low of 46.3 in November, with lower output across both manufacturing and services as demand was hit by inflation, rising borrowing costs and economic uncertainty, suggesting the economy was contracting at an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/865f2592-2fc2-4be7-aef7-210c5e010f68\">annualised rate of 1 per cent</a>.</p> <p>The OECD expects growth of just 0.5 per cent in the US next year and global expansion of 2.2 per cent, driven by the more resilient emerging economies.</p> <h1>Need to know: UK and Europe economy</h1> <p><strong>UK public borrowing</strong> rose in October as the government's measures to help households and businesses with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da60d21b-7fe0-4b1f-85c7-bbf3f4a0b2f6\">energy prices</a> took effect.
