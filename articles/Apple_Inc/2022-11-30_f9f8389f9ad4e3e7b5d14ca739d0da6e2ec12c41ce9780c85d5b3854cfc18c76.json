  "text": "<p>Times you stay off your phone entirely</p><p>When I feel insecure about myself in any way, I generally stay off Instagram…. When I see negative comments, messages or posts about me that are hurtful, or untrue—I must stay off social media so that I don't internalize these things.</p><p>Game you really wish you could delete</p><p>Men. Haha. Just kidding. Fortnite.</p><p>Most-used app</p><p>Google News. I like to keep posted on new scientific breakthroughs, weather and political movements across the globe. The next most-used app is FaceTime. I'm a terrible texter, and I've always been fonder of communicating via face-to-face or voice.</p><p>Favorite food-related app</p><p>Uber Eats, for sure.</p><p>Most listened-to music</p><p>Fave albums right now are some old [ones] by Kadhja Bonet and Jessica Pratt.</p><p>Cities in weather app</p><p>Santo Domingo and Samaná, Dominican Republic; New York City; L.A.; New Orleans; London; Paris, Nice and Cannes; San José, Costa Rica.</p><p>Siri user?</p><p>Yes! My most common voice command is \"Hey, Siri, where you at?\" because I always lose track of where my phone is.</p><p>Battery percentage at which you feel compelled to charge your phone</p><p>I generally react to the red color of my battery to charge it. And, yes, I usually carry an extra battery.</p><p>Favorite Instagram feeds you follow</p><p>@morticiagodiva, @chaninicholas, @adriennemareebrown, @bscott, @sonyareneetaylor, @therealtsmadison, @democracynow.</p><p>Essential travel apps</p><p>Google Translate! And Maps. These two apps really help me get around.</p><p>Favorite emoji</p><p>The sparkle of light.</p><p>Indya Moore Is Probably Looking for Their Phone Right Now</p>",
