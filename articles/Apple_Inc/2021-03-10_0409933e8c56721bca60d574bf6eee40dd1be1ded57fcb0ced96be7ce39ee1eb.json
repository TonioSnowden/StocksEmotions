  "title": "Cherry — Tom Holland stars in a genre-busting crime drama",
  "text": "<p>The endless first-person voiceover that narrates the movie <em>Cherry</em> belongs to Tom Holland, cast as the ex-army medic of the title. The film — a genre-busting social realist/action movie/crime drama — adapts Nico Walker's 2018 autobiographical novel of service in Iraq, opioid addiction and subsequent bank robberies. A cynic might see the wholesale cut-and-paste as directors Joe and Anthony Russo drawing full value from the film rights. (Their production company paid $1m for those.) The truth feels less uncharitable. The Russos clearly love the book. Just as obviously, they are also film-makers noted for their work with Marvel — including the final two Avengers movies — now eager to make art. “Audio-visual entertainment”, a catty Martin Scorsese called the Marvel films. No director wants that on their grave.</p> <p>The brothers cast Holland as their hero, the incumbent Spider-Man but also an actor good enough to lend Cherry depth. “I got a lot of sadness in my face,” he says, and that puppyish bearing is front and centre from the first-act origin story: a portrait of doomed youth in Cleveland, Ohio, heartbreak pending. But old habits die hard for the Russos, even in the absence of capes. While the backdrop is blue-collar, the movie comes with an expensive sheen of camera gymnastics, the editing made for the attention span in a hurry.</p> <p>The sense of having it both ways turns queasy in Iraq. At the risk of sounding like Scorsese, even when it deals frankly with the charnel house reality of war, <em>Cherry</em> feels like a film made by the directors of <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>. The pity is that the strange marriage of the Russos and their material can also be fascinating. When Cherry's tour is over, a dustcloud clears to find him dazed in a high school gymnasium, medals doled out as Cleveland cheers. You can never go home again, the scene says, vividly.</p> <p>But the other hallmark of the Marvel movie is how much of it there is. Here too the Russos stay true to form, the last hour of the film a long riff on junkie movies we have known before. Is all this an indictment, a <em>j'accuse</em> directed at big pharma? Or just the dope-life misadventures of one luckless dude? Don't ask Cherry. He's too busy talking to tell us. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV+ from March 12</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Cherry — Tom Holland stars in a genre-busting crime drama' FT.com 10 March.
