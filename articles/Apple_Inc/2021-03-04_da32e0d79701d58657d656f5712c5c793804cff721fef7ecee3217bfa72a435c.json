  "text": "<p>   How should Americans manage their differences on heated political issues like climate change, campaign finance, race and gender? Our old-fashioned view is that the healthiest way is through democratic debate and deliberation. </p><p>   But the new favored approach is a combination of bureaucratic rule-making and opaque decisions by activist investors and big corporations, so voters don't have a say. President Biden's nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission signaled this week that rather than buck this corrosive trend, he'll lean into it. </p><p>   At Tuesday's confirmation hearing, Sen. Pat Toomey pressed Gary Gensler on the scope of the SEC's authority to regulate politics. Let's say \"a publicly-traded company spends a financially insignificant amount of money on, let's say, electricity,\" Mr. Toomey proposed. \"Is it material whether that electricity came from renewable sources or not?\" </p><p>   Mr. Gensler resisted answering, saying \"it may not be material or it may be material.\" This isn't reassuring. The concept of materiality is crucial to securities regulation because it defines the transparency required for investors to make prudent decisions. The SEC is supposed to protect investors from fraud by making sure they have access to accurate information about a firm's performance. </p><p>   But progressives want to use the agency's watchdog responsibilities as a guise to bend finance in service of unrelated political goals, like climate. Mr. Gensler seemed to reserve the right to impose such politicized disclosure requirements, even when the information is \"financially insignificant.\" </p><p>   Mr. Toomey asked about political contributions, with the example of Apple using a tiny fraction of its revenue for political advocacy. Is that the business of the SEC? Mr. Gensler said yes -- \"last year's proxy season I think shares with us that many investors, well over 40% of investors in those proxy votes, actually think that would be material to get such information.\" </p><p>   Mr. Gensler's standard suggests that if a large number of activist investors want to know certain information for political reasons -- even if the information has no bearing on a firm's balance sheet or business risks -- then the SEC may compel firms to disclose it. Progressive finance titans like Larry Fink would have an ally in the SEC, which would turn into a political as well as securities regulator as it collects information about every U.S. firm's green-energy mix, political affiliations, or racial and gender composition. </p><p>   On that front, one of the first tests will be Nasdaq's effort to impose corporate board mandates based on race, gender and sexual orientation, which the SEC must approve. Mr. Gensler didn't address the Nasdaq proposal directly but seemed to view it favorably. </p><p>   If SEC regulatory resources are diverted to social policy, it won't merely detract from its traditional function of protecting ordinary investors. It will undermine Americans' faith in self-government, as policy results are imposed by financial managers and federal regulators rather than elected officials. </p><p></p>",
