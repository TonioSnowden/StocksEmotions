  "text": "<p>For a legal junkie like me, it's a tense time to be filling in for Rana. The past few weeks have not been a great stretch for those of us who believe that a thoughtful, non-partisan Supreme Court is crucial to the functioning of American democracy. </p> <p>First, the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee turned the confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson into a platform for riling up their base. They constantly interrupted her, attacked her (normal) record on child porn sentencing as a lower court judge, and tried to draw her into damaging comments on critical race theory and the definition of a woman.</p> <p>Although the Harvard-educated judge retained both her cool and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfbaec4a-d1c9-4b77-90a6-afa25c503a9e\">her dignity</a>, most of the GOP is preparing to vote against Jackson on the unproven grounds that she would be a judicial activist. (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0a442e6-5603-4b16-8218-e5fd36b0e1bf#post-9b28ee01-2ef7-4f89-9d16-99edf5e968f4\">Susan Collins of Maine</a> has said she plans to be a rare, and possibly the only, exception to the party-line vote.)</p> <p>Then came the revelations from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/24/virginia-thomas-mark-meadows-texts/\">Bob Woodward and Robert Costa</a> of texts between Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, the wife of longtime justice Clarence Thomas, and then-president Donald Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows, in which she pressed him to help overturn the results of the 2020 elections. The sheer level of paranoia and misinformation in the 29 messages are frightening on their own. </p> <p>What makes the messages a threat to the US constitutional system is that they were part of a trove of digital communications sought by the congressional committee that is investigating the January 6 2021 attack on the Capitol. When Trump asked the Supreme Court to block the transfer of the records, Thomas not only participated in the case, he was the lone justice to indicate he would have kept the records secret.</p> <p>Lower court judges are legally required to recuse themselves from cases where their impartiality could be questioned. Supreme Court justices are trusted to make their own decisions. Thomas knows this and has done so in the past — he did not participate in a 1995 case involving the Virginia Military Institute because his son was enrolled there at the time.</p> <p>As a member of a two-career couple that has periodically had to navigate potential conflicts of interest, I would ordinarily have some sympathy for Ginni Thomas when <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/courts/exclusive-ginni-thomas-sets-the-record-straight-on-january-6/\">she says</a>, “Clarence doesn't discuss his work with me, and I don't involve him in my work.” It would be absolutely unfair to require her to sit at home knitting for fear of some unspecified future conflict.</p> <p>But their behaviour over the years has repeatedly undercut this argument. Back in the early 2000s, Clarence failed to report Ginni's substantial income from the Heritage Foundation on his disclosure forms for <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-xpm-2011-jan-22-la-na-thomas-disclosure-20110122-story.html\">at least five years</a> — until the watchdog group Common Cause pointed it out. He also emphasised how close they are in his 2021 autobiography. His bitter confirmation hearing (when he was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill), he wrote, “had the effect of melding us into one being — an amalgam, as we like to say”.</p> <p>Democrats, outraged at Thomas's failure to recuse himself, are calling for his resignation and for a new law that would impose an ethics code on the Supreme Court. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn't help when she opined that, “I don't think he should have ever been appointed” in the first place. Though she was almost certainly referring to Hill's allegations, the comments risk making the party look vindictive.</p> <p>The whole point of giving nine lawyers the power to review the work of democratically elected politicians is to ensure a cool-headed check rooted in the constitution and legal precedent. Right now, Thomas and most other members of the current conservative majority have another role in mind. They appear bent on rolling back decades of social and economic change, no matter how many past cases they have to overturn along the way. Putting Jackson on the court is unlikely to alter their views or the balance of power.</p> <p>The public already had grave doubts about the court's role before these recent revelations: a Quinnipiac University poll in February found that <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3836\">61 per cent </a>of Americans believed the high court was motivated primarily by politics, and they didn't like it. The court's job approval rating was negative by a 40-47 per cent margin. Highly charged pending cases on abortion and affirmative action are only going to add to the ferment.</p> <p>Ed, where do you think we go from here? Can the US constitutional system survive with a fully politicised Supreme Court?</p> <h1>Recommended Reading</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Most of the chatter about last week's Academy Awards has focused on Will Smith's slap of Chris Rock. The FT's Christopher Grimes points out that it overshadowed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67073d0f-69b8-4b52-a917-836d41be5c8e\">a far more important development:</a> Apple won the Best Picture award for <em>CODA</em>, just three years after launching its streaming service. If you are worried about Big Tech's dominance of just about everything, this is another warning sign.</p></li>  <li><p>I was intrigued by a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/us/politics/madison-cawthorn-congress.html\">New York Times report</a> that Republicans are losing patience with Madison Cawthorn. The freshman congressman from North Carolina is one of the most outrageous of a clutch of Trumpists in the House — he has called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a thug amid the Russian invasion of the country, and he brought a gun through airport security last year. Cawthorn's claims on YouTube that fellow lawmakers had invited him to orgies prompted minority leader Kevin McCarthy to intervene — and Cawthorn is now facing seven primary challengers.</p></li>  <li><p>It is often tempting to think about demography as destiny: Japan's population is ageing, Russia's is shrinking, immigration is inevitable. But Rhodes College professor Jennifer Sciubba argues <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/rich-countries-immigration-border-control/629435/\">in The Atlantic</a> that none of this has to be true. Countries have far-more control over their borders than progressives sometimes admit, and populists and conservatives are exploiting this complacency.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Edward Luce responds </h1> <p>Brooke, here is one plausible version of how events will unfold. Democrats will lose control of Capitol Hill in November. Joe Biden, as was true of Donald Trump and also Barack Obama before him, will increasingly resort to executive orders to substitute for his party's impotence in Congress. A lot of his actions will go straight to the Supreme Court, which will become increasingly bold in striking them down. You referred to the possible overturning, or drastic dilution of Roe vs Wade, which is likely to happen this summer. There will also be a series of challenges to the regulatory state that this court is itching to roll back, as originalists argue that federal agencies should only be allowed to do things specifically mandated by congressional language. On this question, Chief Justice John Roberts is as radical as his most conservative colleagues.</p> <p>My larger concern is that the court will become increasingly alienated from a majority of Americans. Five of the six conservative judges are Catholic. The other, Neil Gorsuch, is Episcopalian though he was raised Catholic. Since Amy Coney Barrett joined there is a strong whiff of anti-secularism and disdain for modern society from the bench. You get the sense that the spirit of <em>Opus Dei</em> is lurking in there somewhere. It is probably a stretch to imagine even this court overturning marriage equality — the 2015 Obergefell vs Hodges ruling. But it is safe to say it would not have made the same judgment. There is no longer a swing judge such as Anthony Kennedy to keep the court from straying too far from America's centre of gravity. </p> <p>This poses a potentially existential threat to the future of the republic that I wrote about in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b159bce5-83e7-4f8e-ab0d-4123660ab539\">FT Weekend cover story</a> in late 2020. A growing body of liberal legal scholars are arguing that America needs a new constitution. The US electoral college is increasingly biased towards small, conservative states in Senate representation and presidential elections. Unlike elected bodies, however, which can always be thrown out, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life. The wider the gulf between public opinion and the actions of two out of three of the federal branches of government, the greater the strain on America's constitutional legitimacy. It is hard to see a comfortable way out of this. As political scientist Francis Fukuyama points out, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/10/26/13352946/francis-fukuyama-ezra-klein\">the US is a vetocracy</a>. If this system refuses to bend, it could eventually break.</p> <h1>Your feedback </h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to: ‘Biden is getting no domestic credit on Ukraine': <br></strong>“Brooke Masters writes, ‘But most Americans I interact with have already started treating the war as background noise.

This is particularly true the farther you get from the East Coast.' I could not agree more. But it is not distance from the East Coast — it is distance from Washington DC and New York City. The more important and continued to be overlooked point is that it has always been thus. This is what the left just cannot seem to get their minds wrapped around. It is in part (heavy emphasis on “in part”) why Trump was elected and why the media was dumbfounded not only at the time but [are] continuing to some degree to [be] today.
