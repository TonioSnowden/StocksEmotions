  "text": "<p>The fashion industry has taken note of our heightened desire for feel-good fabrics and comfy clothes with a wave of tactile creations. More than just loungewear for working from home, however, these include feathery embellishments, stretch silken bodywear, and plush, fluffy textures. Consider it compensation for a monotonous year.</p> <p>This is where fashion merges with haptic science, or the study of touch behaviour. Research shows how soothing, soft surfaces may calm the cardiovascular system and promote the release of Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as “the love hormone”. </p> <p>Haptic and sensorial triggers run the gamut from peppermint-oil-infused organic cotton T-shirts at Pangaia, to the resurrection of chenille from the '80s style graveyard, care of Gucci.</p> <p>“Designers are in tune with the fact that women will look for opportunities to dress up again but without wanting to lose those beautiful, tactile fabrications and the feeling of comfort and luxury,” says Natalie Kingham, global fashion officer at luxury etailer Matches Fashion, of how fashion might look when Covid-19 restrictions ease. </p> <p>“Gabriela Hearst defines this with her fine leather pieces and luxurious tie-dye cashmere knits, camisole dresses and ribbed underpinnings; as does The Row with its buttery soft leathers and Khaite for bodysuits and fitted knit dresses. Customers want tactile pieces to uplift their mood and bring joy.”</p> <p>At Chanel, there are bathrobe-style dresses in plush baby pink cashmere, and cotton tweed Bermuda shorts are teamed with bomber jackets with a springy finish defying tweed's reputation for being slightly prickly. At Jil Sander, the invitation to touch is amplified in semi-sheer organza tunics and dresses slipped over stretch silken bodywear whereby veiled skin becomes part of the appeal. My go-to tactile cocktail is a stretch jersey Paco Rabanne turtleneck, cricket sweater, leggings and leather Prism espadrilles.&#xa0;</p> <p>When travel and social restrictions lift and we dress to show off, the prospect of zipping oneself into a restricting dress will likely feel anachronistic, but the new evening dressing doesn't have to be a chore. Danish designer Cecilie Bahnsen has introduced iridescent sequin knits for spring. “The unique machine embroidery is airy and light and the beautiful 3D sequin texture moves and flickers in the light and breeze when it is worn,” she says.</p> <p>At Hermès, known for its luxury fabrications, creative director Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski talks of materials as “living entities” that appeal equally to touch and sight. She writes via email: “I wanted to capture the fantasy of touch . . . broadening our use of double-face fabrics, from cashmere to cotton to linen that enhance the dimension of sensuality. What you feel from the inside is as soft as what you feel from the outside.” That's certainly true of stretch silk jersey bodysuits paired with supple lambskin skirts and suede calfskin coats featuring roll-up collars in the spring/summer 2021 collection.</p> <p>Enhanced tactility is going to play out well into 2022. At Prada's autumn/winter 2021 menswear presentation, texture was in abundance. The catwalk space was covered in brightly coloured faux fur, and the collection featured knitted bodysuits and giant teddy bear coats.</p> <p>Many of these comforting, cosseting collections start life in the laboratory, with the development of the yarns, and the pandemic has accelerated touch research. Ariane Bigot, associate fashion director of the twice-yearly fabric fair Premiere Vision, touches thousands of samples of fabric every season. “The sensory dimension is even more precious and adds value on and above the visual dimensions — it concerns our personal relationship with garments,” says Bigot. “Remember how fabrics felt as a child? Usually quite dry and ‘hard'.” (The memory of cardboard-like wool blazers and abrasive swim towels are not something I want to revisit.)</p> <p>Now, however, she says “fabric technology with new fibres, ways of spinning, knitting, weaving and finishing has advanced and a fabric can appear quite solid but will feel soft and supple. You no longer have to choose between comfort and fashion,” she adds. Trends for 2022 include puffy, soft leathers, silken knits, soft hemps and linens, normally associated with a coarse, rustic texture. </p> <p>And a new guard of designers is connecting wellbeing and mental health with the power of touch. Arnar Mar Jonsson of the eponymous sports/outerwear brand he founded with fellow RCA graduate, Luke Stevens in 2017, specialises in ergonomic garments in natural fibres including virgin wool and Ventile, an all-weather cotton. “We always consider kinesthetics, soothing textures and nature's positive impact on mental health in our process,” says Jonsson. </p> <p>The sensory dimension can also get a boost from a wave of soft, enveloping perfumes. Azzi Glasser founder of The Perfumer's Story combines notes of amber, sandalwood and tonka bean in her Amber Molecule scent which she describes as “like cashmere on the skin.” </p> <p>Above all, there's fun to be had. Balmain's new Chocolat bags look like giant 3D sections of glossy chocolateand Stuart Vevers, executive creative director at Coach, has been channelling squishy tactility into the Pillow Tabby bag, in plush napa leather. “It invites you to squeeze it and, in a way, feels like a fashionable security blanket,” says Vevers . It's no coincidence that squishy bags are trending as we begin to move our nervous, sensory-deprived selves back into society — hug-ability will be valued highly even if it comes from your own handbag. </p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
