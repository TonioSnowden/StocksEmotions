  "text": "<p>While most services on your devices capture some personal data -- your name, websites you visit, your network IP address, etc. -- apps on your smartphone tend to get more. Your phone is packed with GPS, cameras and other sensors, as well as sensitive data such as your contacts and health status. Apps, if granted various permissions, could access all of that.</p><p>\"It's good to have as few apps as possible, because every app can be a privacy threat,\" said Carissa Veliz, an associate professor at the University of Oxford who researches technology and privacy issues.</p><p>This checklist will help you go through your phone and limit the amount of data you unwittingly share.</p><p>Perform an app audit</p><p>Yes, you should ditch some apps. Delete any downloaded apps you no longer use regularly. Definitely remove unnecessary free ones, because many of those earn revenue from selling your data.</p><p>Comb the service's privacy policy to see how it treats your data. Bear in mind that when you delete an app, the information the developer and its partners already collected won't automatically vanish. You might have to contact them to request data removal, which can be frustrating.</p><p>How to delete apps:</p><p>-- iPhone: Long-press an app icon and select Remove App. (If your unwanted app is in the App Library, the menu option will be Delete App.)</p><p>-- Android: Open the Play Store. Tap your profile icon, then go to Manage apps and devices, then Manage. Tap the app you want to delete, then select Uninstall. Some apps, such as pre-installed ones from carriers, can't be deleted.</p><p>Review access to data</p><p>Take a close look at the permissions you've granted to your apps. Many apps that request access to location, Bluetooth or contacts perform most tasks fine without them.</p><p>Once apps are installed, monitor their data, battery and storage usage in settings.</p><p>For most apps that require it, such as a ride-sharing app, only grant access while using the app. Don't worry, an app is still considered \"in use\" when it's actively using location in the background. When location services are turned off, your device can still send location data to emergency responders when you call 911.</p><p>How to review and revoke permissions:</p><p>-- iPhone: Go to Settings and scroll down to the list of installed apps. Tap each one to see which permissions you have granted, then revoke any you don't think it needs. Next time you're in the app, it will bug you if you revoked a service it really does need to perform.</p><p>You could also go to Settings &gt; Privacy to review each service and all the apps with access to it.</p><p>Then go to the Privacy section of settings and turn on App Privacy Report. It will begin logging the data that your apps access.</p><p>-- Android: Open Settings and select Apps. Tap each app name to view permissions. Select the permission and tap \"Don't allow\" to revoke access. Some Android phones, under Settings &gt; Privacy, have a privacy dashboard. This shows which apps access sensors and data. To see which websites have access to your location, camera and microphone, go to the Chrome app settings, then select Privacy and security &gt; Site settings.</p><p>Limit ad tracking</p><p>Web ad trackers have, for years, followed your activity as you visit different sites. Apple and Google are working to limit the effectiveness of these trackers.</p><p>How to limit cross-site tracking:</p><p>-- iPhone: Open Settings, then Privacy, then select Tracking. Make sure \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" is off, meaning all tracking requests are automatically denied.</p><p>Turn off personalized advertising from Apple by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Apple Advertising, then disabling Personalized Ads.</p><p>-- Android and Chrome: For now, Android users should go into the Chrome app then tap Settings &gt; Privacy and security &gt; Block third-party cookies. You might also see a Privacy Sandbox option, a beta feature to reduce cross-site tracking on the browser. You'll see an option to send a \"Do Not Track\" request. It doesn't hurt to enable it, but many web services don't respect the request, not even Google itself. Turn off personalized advertising by going to Settings &gt; Google &gt; Data and privacy &gt; Ad settings, then disabling Ad personalization. You can also visit adssettings.google.com in a browser.</p>",
