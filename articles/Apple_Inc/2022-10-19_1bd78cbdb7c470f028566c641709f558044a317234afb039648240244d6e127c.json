  "text": "<p>   NFL football is coming to Black Friday. </p><p>   The National Football League has struck a deal with Amazon.com Inc. to stream a game on the Friday after Thanksgiving in 2023, which is known as the official kickoff of the Christmas shopping season. </p><p>   The NFL and Amazon indicated the plan is for the game to become a permanent fixture. </p><p>   The game will be a \"key new pillar\" for the league, NFL Media Chief Operating Officer Hans Schroeder said on a conference call to discuss the new game. Marie Donoghue, Amazon's vice president of global sports video, said: \"We see this as starting a new holiday tradition.\" </p><p>   For Amazon, having an NFL game on its streaming platform on what is known as the biggest shopping day of the year would give it a large promotional platform for its own retail efforts. </p><p>   The deal deepens the partnership between the NFL and Amazon, which this season started streaming the league's \"Thursday Night Football\" franchise. Amazon has an 11-year deal for \"Thursday Night Football\" at a price tag of $1.2 billion annually, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. </p><p>   Neither the league or Amazon would comment on the terms of adding a new game to Amazon's current package. </p><p>   The new game also gets Amazon in on Thanksgiving weekend. While Amazon has \"Thursday Night Football,\" its package doesn't include a Thanksgiving game. The NFL's Thanksgiving games are on CBS, NBC and Fox. </p><p>   Amazon is also among the potential suitors for NFL's Sunday Ticket package, which will be available after this season. Sunday Ticket is a direct-to-consumer offering currently available on satellite broadcaster DirecTV that allows subscribers access to all out-of-market games. Apple Inc. and Google's YouTube also are circling the property, the Journal has reported. </p><p></p>",
