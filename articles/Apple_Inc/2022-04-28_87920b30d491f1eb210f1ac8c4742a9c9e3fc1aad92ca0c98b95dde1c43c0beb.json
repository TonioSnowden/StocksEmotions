  "title": "Why Does the U.S. Want to Ban Menthol Cigarettes? Menthols, which health officials say pose a greater health risk than regular cigarettes, are a crucial market for tobacco companies",
  "text": "<p>The FDA intends to ban the sale of menthol cigarettes in the U.S., as well as all flavored cigars. The agency said it is considering allowing exemptions on a case-by-case basis for certain products, such as heated-tobacco devices or cigarettes with very low nicotine levels.</p><p>When will it take effect?</p><p>Not for at least two years—and likely longer than that. The FDA on Thursday published the proposed rules and invited public comments, which the agency must then review. The FDA could publish final rules as early as 2023, and it could take effect as early as 2024. At least two tobacco companies have indicated that they might then sue; litigation could further delay the ban.</p><p>Will menthol e-cigarettes be banned too?</p><p>The ban on menthol cigarettes wouldn't apply to menthol e-cigarettes. But the FDA is separately reviewing all vaping products on the U.S. market and is looking closely at those with menthol flavors. The agency's mandate is to authorize vaping products only if their manufacturers can demonstrate that they are in the interest of public health. As part of that review, the FDA is weighing whether the potential benefit of menthol e-cigarettes as an alternative for adult cigarette smokers outweighs their appeal to children and teens.</p><p>The agency has said it would soon decide whether the largest e-cigarette brands, including Juul and Vuse Alto, can keep their products on the market. Both brands currently offer tobacco- and menthol-flavored refill cartridges. The FDA so far has ordered off the market more than a million flavored vaping products, including liquids with flavors such as apple crumble, cola and cinnamon toast cereal.</p><p>Which companies have the most at stake in a menthol-cigarette ban?</p><p>For tobacco companies, menthols are a crucial segment of the cigarette business. Because menthol smokers skew younger than average, they represent a longer potential lifetime of smoking. And over the past decade, menthols have gained an increasing share of U.S. cigarette sales.</p><p>A U.S. menthol ban would be a huge blow to British American Tobacco PLC, which in 2017 spent about $50 billion to take full control of Reynolds American Inc. Reynolds makes Newport, the leading U.S. menthol-cigarette brand. Menthols account for more than half of BAT's U.S. cigarette unit sales and roughly 30% of its global profits, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Pamela Kaufman.</p><p>Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc. holds the No. 2 spot in the U.S. menthol-cigarette market. The company over the past several years has pushed to expand its share of the menthol category, launching new products such as Marlboro Ice, Marlboro Bold Ice and Benson &amp; Hedges Menthol.</p><p>What are menthol cigarettes?</p><p>Menthol, a compound that occurs naturally in mint plants, has been added to cigarettes since the 1920s. Menthol cigarettes create a cooling sensation in the mouth and throat, similar to that of a mentholated cough drop. Health officials say that eases the throat irritation caused by cigarette smoke, making menthols more appealing to young people and people who have never smoked. Menthol also interacts with nicotine in the brain to enhance nicotine's addictive effects, according to the FDA.</p><p>Why ban them?</p><p>The 2009 Tobacco Control Act said the FDA could prohibit menthol cigarettes only if it could demonstrate that a ban would be a net benefit to public health, taking into account potential unintended consequences such as an illicit market. The law ordered the FDA's tobacco-products advisory committee to study the issue. The FDA concluded in 2013 that menthols are harder to quit and likely pose a greater health risk than regular cigarettes. U.S. health officials say a menthol ban would reduce youth initiation, increase the success rate for smokers trying to quit and address health disparities among people of color. The ban is also part of the Biden administration's Cancer Moonshot initiative to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50% over the next 25 years.</p><p>Menthols are the overwhelming cigarette of choice for Black smokers. Smoking is a major contributor to heart disease, cancer and strokes—the three leading causes of death among African-Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And Black people in the U.S. die at a higher rate than other groups from smoking-related cancers, according to CDC research.</p><p>About 12.5% of adults in the U.S., or 30.8 million people, were cigarette smokers in 2020, according to the CDC.</p><p>A recent study from the University of Waterloo in Canada projected that a ban on menthol cigarettes in the U.S. would prompt 1.3 million smokers to quit, including more than 380,000 Black smokers, in the first four to 23 months after the ban goes into effect.</p><p>Who smokes menthol cigarettes?</p><p>For decades, cigarettecompanies marketed menthol brands such as Newport, Kool and Salem to Black people, distributing free packs in Black neighborhoods and running magazine and billboard ads depicting carefree Black smokers. The companies also encouraged the belief that menthols were soothing and had a medicinal effect.</p><p>The share of U.S. smokers who use menthols has risen continuously, from 30.5% in 2005 to 43% in 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.</p><p>In the U.S., 81% of Black smokers and 51% of Hispanic smokers used menthols in 2020, compared with 30% of white smokers.</p><p>Is the tobacco industry fighting the ban?</p><p>Yes. Two tobacco companies sued the FDA in 2011 over the advisory committee's initial review of menthol cigarettes. Reynolds and Altria have hinted that they might turn to the courts if the menthol ban goes into effect.</p><p>Altria and Reynolds have disputed the FDA's conclusions on the health effects of menthols and have argued that a ban would have unintended consequences.</p><p>Reynolds has funded opposition efforts led by prominent Black community leaders. They have said menthol bans would expand the illicit market for cigarettes and lead police to racially profile Black smokers. The American Civil Liberties Union and some members of the Congressional Black Caucus have expressed similar concerns.</p><p>The FDA and other proponents of a national menthol ban, including the NAACP, have countered that the ban would apply to manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers—not individual consumers.</p><p>—Tom McGinty contributed to this article.</p><p>This article may be updated .</p><p>Write to Jennifer Maloney at Jennifer.Maloney@wsj.com</p><p>Why Does the U.S. Want to Ban Menthol Cigarettes?</p>",
