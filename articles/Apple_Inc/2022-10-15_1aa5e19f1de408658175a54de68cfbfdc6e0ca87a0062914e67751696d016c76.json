  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Apple Store Votes to Unionize",
  "text": "<p>\"Now that we've won the election, it is our hope that management will come to the table so that we may collectively work towards building a company that prioritizes workers over profit and encourages employees to thrive,\" said Charity Lassiter, an employee at the Oklahoma City store and a member of the organizing committee.</p><p>Employees voted 56 to 32 in favor of joining a union, according to a ballot count Friday evening released by the National Labor Relations Board.</p><p>An Apple spokesman said: \"We believe the open, direct and collaborative relationship we have with our valued team members is the best way to provide an excellent experience for our customers, and for our teams. We're proud to provide our team members with strong compensation and exceptional benefits.\"</p><p>The vote follows a successful unionization push in June at an Apple Store in Towson, Md., a suburb of Baltimore. Those employees joined the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace.</p><p>Apple retail workers at other stores have tried to unionize, including locations in New York City and Atlanta. While the Atlanta workers in May withdrew a petition to vote on unionization, organizers have said they might seek to hold a vote at a later time. In New York, the federal labor agency recently issued a complaint against Apple that it had allegedly prohibited the placement of pro-union fliers in the employee break room and interrogated workers about their support of a union.</p><p>Unions are pushing to grow as companies struggle with labor shortages and workers demand more from their employers. Private-sector union membership has been facing a long-term decline. A record low of 6.1% of workers were members of a union in the private sector in 2021, according to the Labor Department.</p>",
