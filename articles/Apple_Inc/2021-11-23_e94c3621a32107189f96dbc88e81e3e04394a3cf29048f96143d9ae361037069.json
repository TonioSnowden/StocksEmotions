  "text": "<p>(Norton, 408 pages, $28.95)</p><p>It may sound bizarre that a family memoir of the Holocaust would include recipes for such Austrian delicacies as apple strudel, Linzer torte and Sacher torte. But it was these mouthwatering pastries that, in the years before Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, attracted crowds to Innsbruck's popular Cafe Schindler, a convivial establishment alive with nightly music and dancing -- owned and run, until the Nazis seized it, by a local Jewish family named Schindler.</p><p>This explains the lingering tastes and luscious aromas that permeate Meriel Schindler's affecting \"The Lost Cafe Schindler: One Family, Two Wars, and the Search for Truth.\" Add to that Innsbruck's stunning setting in the mountainous Austrian Tyrol, and the mood is set for the Schindler family's prosperous pre-World War II assimilation and seeming acceptance into Austrian society -- and the Nazis' ruthless transformation of their world to wreckage.</p><p>Ms. Schindler's father, Kurt, was 13 when he and his parents lost their cafe in 1938, fleeing the Reich and finding refuge in London. Other close family members were unable to escape. \"Recipient has emigrated to Poland\" -- a euphemism for forced deportation to the ghettos and ultimately to the death camps -- was the chilling message on the final letters returned from Austria to England in 1941.</p><p>Growing up in the 1960s and '70s, Ms. Schindler admits, she was mostly oblivious to her family's traumatic history. She had to attend, more immediately, to the fallout from her father's turbulent and unpredictable behavior. It was only after his death, in 2017 at the age of 91, that she felt ready to confront the legacy of loss that shaped the unsettled course of his life and, by extension, her own tumultuous childhood.</p><p>As she sets out on her journey into her family's past, the irony is not lost on her that the tool that best equips her for the task -- her flawless German -- is a product of the unhappy school years in the Tyrol that her father had forced upon her. Now, as she reads the yellowed pages of the family's prewar correspondence, her horror at their fates is further intensified as she comes to know them as individuals.</p><p>She is particularly drawn to Kurt's aunt Martha, who rallies kindness and resignation to overcome personal dread in what she knows will be her farewell letter: \"With giant steps we appear to be rushing towards the abyss into which we shall fall. Feeling as if my heart were caught in a vice, I have just one wish, that is to use that very brief span of time that I presumably have left to let all the love flow out.\" In her memory, Ms. Schindler places a portrait of this great-aunt she never knew on her desk. \"Whenever I am daunted by the enormity of the task I have taken on,\" she writes, \"I look at it.\"</p><p>Ms. Schindler's legal expertise -- she is a partner at a London firm -- also proves essential in untangling the machinations, as intricate as they were deceitful, that made it legal for local Nazi officials to enrich themselves by confiscating her family's personal and business property. She is further repulsed by the loophole-filled postwar regulations that allowed these perpetrators not only to deny their part in the transactions, blaming instead the banks that handled the deals, but also to assert that they therefore had no obligation to pay restitution.</p><p>The endless maneuvering between Kurt's family and the authorities of each successive government can be tedious to wade through until you realize, as Ms. Schindler does, the dispiriting and enraging impact they must have had on Kurt as he doggedly pursued his claims through the decades. That leads the author to wonder if the polar realities her father lived through in his youth -- the central position the cafe played, at its height, in Innsbruck society, abruptly giving way to Hitler's campaign to annihilate the Jews -- might have exacerbated the manic patterns of entitled self-aggrandizement and dark paranoia he experienced in adulthood.</p><p>Such an explanation would also take in his routine declarations that the family was related to just about every well-known Jew in Europe, including Franz Kafka. Ms. Schindler is therefore shocked to discover that a distant branch of the Schindler family tree actually did include the author of \"Metamorphosis\" and \"The Trial.\" Even more astoundingly, she verifies the most outlandish of her father's boasts: that Hitler had personally intervened to help two Schindler relatives escape Nazi Germany. In the early 1900s, Dr. Eduard Bloch of Linz had been the physician of a local family named Hitler. Bloch's devoted care of the widowed Klara Hitler in her final months so moved her son that the grief-stricken Adolf wrote the physician twice to express his thanks. Fast forward to 1938, and it was Bloch's turn to write the Fuhrer to ask for protection; Hitler agreed, and provided a document that allowed the physician and his wife to safely leave the Reich in 1940.</p><p>Ms. Schindler wisely provides a detailed family tree to indicate how one family member is related to another -- exactly where, for instance, the Blochs fit in. (Answer: through the Kafka branch.) But it is still difficult to keep all the complicated connections straight, and the details of one intertwined story can blur into another. She also can't refrain from following up on various historical sidebars, some of which are less interesting than others.</p><p>Yet through her research she clearly documents the simmering presence of anti-Semitism in the Tyrol throughout the decades that preceded Hitler's rise. Those tropes are unsettlingly visible in the vicious political cartoons and pamphlets, some of which are reproduced here, that fanned fears of the Jewish \"threat.\" To refute the poisonous stereotypes, Ms. Schindler's grandfather and great-uncles, like many other Austrian Jews, demonstrated their patriotism by fighting in World War I. And beyond its scrumptious menu, the glitteringly successful Cafe Schindler stood out for its gracious welcome to all, locals and tourists, Christians and Jews, right through the 1920s and into the 1930s.</p><p>All, ultimately, to no avail. Which is why Ms. Schindler's insight-filled reckoning with the past can't help but leave behind a bitter taste that no amount of Sacher torte can disguise.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Cole is the author of the memoir \"After Great Pain: A New Life Emerges.\"</p>",
