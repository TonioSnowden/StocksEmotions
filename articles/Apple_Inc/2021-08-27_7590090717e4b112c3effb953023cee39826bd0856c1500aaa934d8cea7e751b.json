  "text": "<p>\n  A large part of the mystical allure of homeownership is the attraction of having a garage. But, in many homes, cars outnumber garage spaces. To help you and your loved ones achieve garage harmony, allow me to offer my services as a Garage Arbitration Specialist. </p><p>\n  For this process to work, there is one overarching rule you must remember: Your garage is not a space for your car. It is a privilege, an award, a gift, a precious and scarce commodity. Owning the home gives you no special right to the garage if the number of cars in the home is G+1 (or more than 1), in which G is the garage capacity. It's crucial that all family members get this through their thick skulls. </p><p>\n  With that in mind, here is the Hierarchy of Garage Needs. This is the order of priority that should be used to determine who should have access to the coveted garage space or spaces, ranked based on precedence. You and your family need to agree on this priority list, or devise your own. All car-owning family members must agree to abide by the final arbitrated Hierarchy. The penalty for failure to do so is that the Apple TV password will be changed and the offender will not be told what it is. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  THE HIERARCHY OF GARAGE NEEDS </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New car: New cars will receive unhindered access to the garage for one full year, starting on the day it is picked up at the showroom or delivered to the home. This applies to new cars only. Used cars, even really nice certified pre-owned ones, are not eligible for access. Vehicle title or bill of sale is required. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Recently washed car: A freshly washed car, especially one that was hand-washed by the owner in full view of other household members, is entitled to three days of garage access. If the car was also hand-waxed, the access is extended by another three days. If the car was professionally detailed (exterior and interior), garage access is one week. Dated receipt required. If, during routine car usage during the garage-access period, the car gets covered in mud, road slush, tar or bird excrement, garage access is immediately forfeited. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Forecast of accumulating snow: In the event of a large winter storm in which more than two (2) inches of snow is predicted, garage access is granted based on owner age, from oldest to youngest. Birth certificate required. Access rules apply until winter storm is over, and all snow has been removed from the driveway travel lanes. In some parts of the U.S., the Snow Rule may be in effect for an entire winter, unless superseded by the New or Washed Car Rule. (Please note that attempting to have one's car washed or detailed during a winter storm event for the sole purpose of gaining access to the garage is, firstly, grounds for forfeit of all garage privileges for at least two months, and, secondly, a stupid idea since your car will be covered in road slush by the time you get home, thus negating the Washed Car Rule.) </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Injured, ill or infirmed owner: Garage access is allowed ONLY for the period during which the person has a medically diagnosed illness or infirmity. Doctor's note, updated weekly, required to maintain garage access. And really, if it's so bad you can't park outside, should you even be driving? </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Heavy loads: Garage access is granted for the car owner transporting groceries and/or laundry for the duration of the day during which unloading is required. Any other heavy loads needing to be brought inside are considered discretionary and you should have thought about getting that thing into the house before you brought it home in the back of your car. Why didn't you just have it delivered? Then it would be someone else's problem. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Rain: Unless the car owner is physically made of sugar, there are no garage access privileges extended during rain events, unless rain is due to a named tropical storm. In this case, the New Car Rule applies, since that owner is probably paying through the nose for insurance and the rates will just go up even higher if the new car gets even a dent. Insurance companies suck so much. </p><p>\n  During the Hierarchy negotiation phase, vehicle age, from newest to oldest, determines garage usage. During this period, if a family member deploys any of the following strategies to secure unauthorized garage access, that person will forfeit all rights to garage usage in perpetuity. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"Whack-a-Mole\" Maneuver: Car owner pretends to drive into town for an errand and instead waits around the corner until a garage spot is freed up, at which point the owner swoops in and claims the spot. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"Early Bird\" Stratagem: Car owner leverages knowledge of family schedules to always be home 10 minutes before anyone else to claim a garage spot, even if it means having to use an hour of personal time every day to leave work early. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Loss of Keys: The owner of the car in the garage claims to have lost the keys. They walk, bike, Uber or cadge rides with friends everywhere, while the car just sits in the garage, taking up valuable space and pissing everyone off. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Retaliatory Blockage: Car owner without garage access purposely parks directly behind the garage door(s), cutting off all garage usage and/or trapping cars within. </p><p>\n  By using the Hierarchy of Garage Needs as a starting point, followed by compassionate and thoughtful negotiation and bribes, you and your family members can arrive at the garage access priorities that work best for you. If you find you are unable to do so, simply turn the garage into a gym, an in-law apartment or a bar and let all your vehicles just rot out there in the weather on your driveway, bearing the brunt of your inability to behave like rational adults. </p><p></p>",
