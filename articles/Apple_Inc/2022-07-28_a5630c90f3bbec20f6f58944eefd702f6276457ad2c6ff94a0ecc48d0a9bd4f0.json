  "title": "These clean energy ETFs have been outperforming — and there's a fundamental reason why; Critical information for the U.S. trading day",
  "text": "<p>On Thursday, the Schumer-Manchin deal lifted various clean energy plays including SunRun RUN, Plug Power PLUG and First Solar FSLR by as much as 12% in premarket trade.</p><p>And it's the kind of thinking that had already helped bolster clean energy as a high-profile investment theme of late.</p><p>While the S&amp;P 500 is down 3.8% over the past three months, the three biggest U.S.-listed ETFs in the category, iShares Global Clean Energy ICLN, Invesco Solar, TAN and the First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund QCLN were up 7.6 %, 20.2% and 9.1% respectively, even before the Schumer-Manchin deal hit the headlines.</p><p>But how much of the recent performance is the result of market fashion and how much fundamentals, asks Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research.</p><p>She looked at each ETF's top U.S. holdings –- companies such as Enphase ENPH, SolarEdge SEDG, First Solar FSLR, and Tesla TSLA — and analyzed whether their 2022 and 2023 analyst consensus earnings forecasts have gone up or down over the past 90 days.</p><p>\"Essentially, what we want to know is if fundamentals for the space are improving or deteriorating,\" says Rabe, and the bottom line is that most of the top three names in the ETFs have seen upside earnings revisions for this year and next over the last three months.</p><p>\"With analysts growing more confident about renewable energy companies' earnings potential this year and particularly in 2023, their outperformance versus the broader market over the past three months and year-to-date in some cases makes sense from a fundamental standpoint,\" Rabe adds.</p><p>A note of caution, though. Rabe recognises that the ETFs highlighted peaked near the beginning of 2021, after the Democrats took control of Washington. The ETF's price vacillations since then show a correlation to likely primacy of green policy, and it's expected that Republicans are expected to take back control of Congress later this year.</p><p>\"Policy uncertainty contributes to volatility in these names, however, and that is unlikely to change over the next 2-4 years. With mid-term U.S. elections just 106 days away, investors with an interest in the space may want to wait until the results are in before allocating fresh capital to this disruptive tech theme,\" Rabe said, in a note written ahead of the Schumer-Manchin agreement.</p><p>The markets</p><p>U.S. stock futures ES00 NQ00were weaker, but not by much, after the latest GDP report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 2.72%.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>The U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.9% in the second quarter, data released on Thursday showed. The outcome was notably worse than analysts' forecast for 0.3% growth and follows a 1.6% fall in the first quarter.</p><p>The morning after the Federal Reserve's latest 75 basis point rate hike and now attention inevitably turns to what happens next. Following the GDP figures, futures markets are pricing in a 70% chance the Fed will take things a bit easier at the next meeting in September, delivering just a 50 basis point increase in borrowing costs.</p><p>Shares in Meta META, owner of Facebook, are sliding before the opening bell after the company said profits had declined for the third quarter in a row.</p><p>Teladoc TDOC, former bull-market and lockdown darling, is slumping 23% in pre-market action after another massive impairment charge took the telehealth company's losses for the first six months of the year to nearly $10 billion.</p><p>Barclays UK:BARC, the U.K. bank, has set aside £1.3 billion ($1.6 billion) to cover a trading blunder.</p><p>Other earnings reports included Mastercard MA and Merck MRK, which published before the market opened. Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Intel INTC and Roku ROKU step up to the plate after the closing bell.</p><p>Best of the web</p><p>Axie Infinity and failed crypto hope in the Philippines</p><p>Investors must stay away from the herd says Howard Marks</p><p>The backlash againstAmerican immigrants in Mexico City</p><p>The chart</p><p>Japanese investors are selling foreign bonds at a record pace. Why? Bank of America analysts note that in the past, life assurance groups tended to increase foreign bond purchases when the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, after hedging for foreign exchange risk, \"exceeded the super-long JGB yield in a sustainable manner\". But \"currently, the 30-year JGB yields 1.2%, while the 10y US Treasury yields -0.4% after FX hedges,\" BofA says.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>Here were the most active stock-market tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m. Eastern. </p><p> Ticker   Security name  TSLA     Tesla  GME      GameStop  META     Meta Platforms  AMC      AMC Entertainment  AAPL     Apple  AMZN     Amazon  NIO      NIO  XELA     Exela Technologies  MSFT     Microsoft  NVDA     NVIDIA</p><p>Random reads</p><p>Criminal simian Gecko sneakers Taiwan's Breaking Bad</p><p>Need to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
