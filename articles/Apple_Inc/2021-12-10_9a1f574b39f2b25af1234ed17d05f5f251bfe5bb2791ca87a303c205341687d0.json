  "title": "A tale of two cultures: must Britain choose between science and the arts?",
  "text": "<p>On a cloudy day in Battersea, within a stone's throw of the river Thames, Paul Thompson strides happily around an enormous but empty building, pointing out spaces. “We will have the fine artists in here and robotics over there — aerial drones and a tank for submersible robots to mend oil rigs. The idea is not to make cultures clash, but to keep introducing them to each other.”</p> <p>This should be the ideal time to be vice-chancellor of the Royal College of Art, the world's leading arts and design university. The RCA, founded 184 years ago to add design skills to the UK's manufacturing prowess, outranks global competitors and is still growing. When it opens to students early in the new year, the 15,500 square metre building, designed by the Tate Modern architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, will be the RCA's biggest expansion since 1961.</p> <p>It is a bulwark of the UK's global strength in the arts, music, fashion, film-making, advertising and architecture. The creative industries — dubbed “Cool Britannia” at the turn of the century — directly employed 2.1m people, producing £116bn in gross value added before the pandemic. They are now expected to recover faster than the economy as a whole.</p> <p>But Boris Johnson's government has had second thoughts about the approach pioneered by the RCA — combining creativity with science and technology to foster economic growth. It has turned its focus to the latter: scientists such as Demis Hassabis, co-founder of the artificial intelligence group DeepMind, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2ae1fff-9747-41a3-b347-861ac1a70709\">Sarah Gilbert</a>, a professor at Oxford university who led research on AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, are the new role models.</p> <p>Higher education funding for arts and design was <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2021/07/22/uk-government-approves-50percent-funding-cut-for-arts-and-design-courses\">cut</a> this year in favour of science and mathematics, a contrast with the £54m that George Osborne, the former chancellor, allocated in 2016 to the RCA building. The prime minister praised the “pure genius” of Peppa Pig's creators in his recent <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-the-cbi-conference-22-november-2021\">speech</a> to the CBI, but he also extolled apprenticeships and “skills, skills, skills”.</p> <p>The change in tone frustrates Sir Jony Ive, RCA chancellor and Apple's former chief design officer. “I think the extraordinary, disproportionate contribution creatives make to the economy is incontrovertible. My work at Apple over 30 years shows that ideas which start out as tentative and fragile can turn into entire businesses. So I'm slightly bemused that we're still having this discussion.”</p> <p>The debate has gone on for centuries. Design was a key appeal of the pottery sold around the world by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f62024f-25a8-4005-905d-cbaadd0f7022\">Josiah Wedgwood</a> in the 18th century but by the early 19th century, politicians were worrying about the superiority of French and German products. That led to the RCA being founded as the first government school of design in 1837. The <a href=\"https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib4_1267714397\">intention</a>, according to an observer, was to make “the architect, the upholsterer, the weaver, the printer, the potter, and all manufacturers . . . better educated to invest [products] with greater symmetry of form, with increased harmony of colour”.</p> <p>The gap between arts and industry is portrayed in the tension between the practical Henry Wilcox and the artistic Schlegel sisters in EM Forster's 1910 novel <em>Howards End</em>. CP Snow, the novelist and chemist, bemoaned a lack of sympathy between British science and the humanities in <em>The Two Cultures </em>(1959). “Between [them is] a gulf of mutual incomprehension — sometimes hostility and dislike, but most of all a lack of understanding. The two have a curious, distorted view of each other.”</p> <p>The RCA, which now teaches 2,500 postgraduate students from 73 countries, aims to bridge the gulf. Its alumni include the artist Tracey Emin, the entrepreneur Sir James Dyson, and the architect Sir David Adjaye. “We see ourselves as having a vital role in wealth and job creation, and in the UK's quality of life — the social and cultural aspects of the creative arts,” Thompson says.</p> <p>But the rapid growth of arts and design undergraduate courses since the tuition cap was raised to £9,000 in 2012 has attracted criticism. The Institute for Fiscal Studies found last year that graduates in economics and medicine gained much higher <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/14729\">lifetime earnings</a>. The contrast was stark for men: those who studied science and medicine earned a graduate premium of £500,000, compared with “negative average returns” for arts courses. Financially, courses at some institutions were not worth taking.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-18-review-of-education-and-funding-independent-panel-report\">2019 review</a> of English post-18 education headed by Philip Augar, the author and former City banker, reached a similar view. It concluded that the growth of university education, at an annual public cost of £8bn in 2017-18, was unmatched in two-year further education, which had suffered “decades of neglect and a loss of status and prestige”. The nation needed stronger technical and vocational education, rather than inflation in “low value degrees”.</p> <p>Augar says some universities used the trebling of tuition fees in 2012 to expand courses including social sciences, arts or business studies that were cheaper to provide, in effect cross-subsidising costly provision in science and medicine. “The country needs to nurture high-quality courses and institutions, but there are courses out there with low progression rates and poor graduate earnings that involve a heavy taxpayer subsidy through loan write-offs.”</p> <p>That critique chimes with the government's post-Brexit shift towards levelling up and allocating more to the deprived, in both geographical and educational terms. This year's £20m halving of arts and design teaching grants is a small part of total funding (“a much bigger subsidy is through the loan write-off so it is a shaving, rather than an axing,” Augar says) and leading institutions, including the RCA and the Courtauld Institute of Art, have <a href=\"https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/news-blog-and-events/press-and-media/ofs-sets-out-funding-proposals-for-world-leading-specialist-providers/\">received</a> £10m. But the previously warm mood has turned chillier.</p> <p>On his tour of the brick-faced Herzog &amp; de Meuron building in Battersea, Thompson extols the benefits of combining arts with science, technology and mathematics to make “Steam” out of “Stem”. The RCA is solely a postgraduate university, and a third of its students come there with undergraduate degrees in other subjects, such as chemistry and engineering. Many have already been in work, but want to hone their skills or acquire design expertise. </p> <p>Melding Snow's two cultures can produce rewards. Among the start-ups to emerge from InnovationRCA, its entrepreneurship centre, is <a href=\"https://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/rca-stories/reducing-methane-emissions-tackle-climate-crisis/\">Zelp</a>, which has designed a cattle mask to curb methane emissions, and <a href=\"https://www.rca.ac.uk/business/innovationrca/start-companies/ananas-anam/\">Ananas Anam</a>, which produces a vegan leather substitute from waste pineapple leaves. One-third of the founders are women, and 71 per cent of the start-ups last for five years or more, a high success rate.</p> <p>It is easy to convince the private sector. Partnerships with companies including Snap, Epic Games and Logitech are on show, from a screen used to visualise the flow of ocean debris to augmented reality for fashion ecommerce. “When I saw my first student show at the RCA, it blew my mind. It was like being plugged into a socket,” says Dame Gail Rebuck, chair of the RCA council and of Penguin Random House UK.</p> <p>It is a harder sell in terms of public funding. Caroline Norbury, chief executive of the industry network Creative UK, says there is nostalgia among politicians for industries that once provided well-paid manual work. “When [ministers] want a bit of stardust, they'll call up someone shiny but we are still fighting decades of prejudice about arts being for a privileged few. The reality is that a school leaver is far more likely to have a sustainable career in games than as a vehicle panel beater.”</p> <p>The Treasury needs students to be able to repay loans, and the chances of doing so appear clearly to be better in fields with high entry-level salaries, such as accounting or engineering. One-third of people in creative industries are self-employed and many rely on short-term projects, some of them abroad. They produce long-term value for the UK, but not a reliable flow of income and taxes.</p> <p>Lesley Giles, director of the research group Work Advance, argues that ministers are being misled by data that does not capture how economies are evolving: “These are narrow judgments about the worth of education based on short-term earnings. In a more agile and dynamic economy, we need the creative skills that enable people not to be replaced by robots.”</p> <p>Institutions that lack the RCA's global reach face an even greater challenge. One is Nottingham Trent University, <a href=\"https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/news/news-articles/2018/02/175-year-university-history-helps-shape-the-future\">founded</a> just after the RCA in 1843, also as a government school of design. It serves students from former mining towns such as Eastwood, and is building a <a href=\"https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/news/news-articles/2021/10/work-to-commence-on-new-landmark-35m-art-and-design-building\">£35m centre</a> for its school of arts and design. It often encounters scepticism about whether courses in fashion and textiles truly offer a viable alternative for local school-leavers.</p> <p>“The local newspaper had a dig at us for offering knitting as a degree course, but we have a professor here who did pioneering work for the European Space Agency on knitting satellite antennae,” says Michael Marsden, dean of the NTU's design school. “Facebook is now talking about the metaverse and we are shifting provision to screen-based technologies. We try to reflect where industries are going rather than a dogged determination to stick with the past.”</p> <p>Ive, who with Marc Newson heads the design firm Love From, says that arts and design should not be seen solely through an economics lens — the value of creativity reaches beyond that. “I think there's a moral imperative. The challenges that we face, from climate change to overconsumption, are so great that we have to nurture curiosity and be inquisitive and open to the future.”</p> <p>The British tend to be good at working in this way, Ive believes. “There's a comfort with challenging the status quo, almost a relish in being different and not accepting the received wisdom. It's a combination of rigour and an incredible appetite to create and explore.” This is reflected in educational prestige: the RCA led the <a href=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2021/art-design\">QS global ranking</a> of arts and design universities this year, with the University of the Arts London, which includes Central Saint Martins, in second place.</p> <p>Both institutions have international clout, and changes in government policy may push them to be more global. Brexit caused a sharp fall in the number of EU applicants to the RCA, not only because they face higher fees, but because those without settled status <a href=\"https://www.savethestudent.org/international-students/a-guide-to-uk-tuition-fees-for-eu-students.html\">no longer qualify</a> for the UK's student loan scheme. Despite that, about 75 per cent of the RCA's students are foreign, with more now coming from countries including India and China.</p> <p>This raises the issue of how much a university at which only a quarter of students are British contributes to the UK economy, as opposed to spreading creativity elsewhere. It contrasts with the RCA's origins as a school for British apprentices to match foreign design skills. Many RCA students have stayed in the UK after graduating — Ananas Anam is a UK company although its founder Carmen Hijosa is Spanish — but the decline in EU students with rights to remain puts this in doubt.</p> <p>Thompson says the low proportion of UK students at the RCA is partly due to a dip in past birth rates, and will recover. The fact that more British students are taking arts and design at undergraduate level is starting to feed through into postgraduate degrees. The RCA also hopes to lure back EU students by introducing modular courses, so a student who can study more cheaply in Switzerland or Germany will transfer to the RCA with course credits.</p> <p>But Thompson acknowledges the broader dilemma for the UK. “We love our international students, and the cultural and intellectual diversity they bring. But we now have a business model that is predicated upon overseas student fees, and you need to ask whether that is wise for the country when its universities are national assets. Should they be funded this way?”</p> <p>It is a crucial question, and the government's answer remains unclear. If it transfers significant higher education funding from the arts to shorter term, more vocational further education, it may leave some institutions stranded. Snow lamented the UK's two cultures, and it now faces two futures: keeping faith with the arts as an economic driving force, or turning back.</p> <p>It is not just a matter of arts versus science, or even national versus international, but of the purpose of education itself. As in other ways, Brexit may alter the calculation. “I think we're generally born curious and inquisitive, and sadly that is often educated out of us,” says Ive. A British government founded the RCA nearly 200 years ago; this one may not be so creative.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/john-gapper\"><em>John Gapper</em></a><em> is an FT columnist</em></p> <p><em>Data visualisation by </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/alan-smith\"><em>Alan Smith</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e82f5bbb-29e5-4988-b527-cfdceb3ee9ac\"><em>Skilled manual jobs remain at the cutting edge / From Chris McDonald, Chief Executive Officer, Materials Processing Institute, Middlesbrough, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: John Gapper 2021 'A tale of two cultures: must Britain choose between science and the arts?'
