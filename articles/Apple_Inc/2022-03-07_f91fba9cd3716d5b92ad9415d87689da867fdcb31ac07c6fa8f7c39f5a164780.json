  "text": "<p>Happy March, readers, wherever you may be.</p> <p>As the war in Ukraine nears the two-week mark, payment companies have increasingly moved to shut Russia out from their systems. On Friday, UK neobank Revolut began blocking transfers to Russia; Wise (formerly TransferWise) began capping transfers to Russia last month.</p> <p>But most notable is the news that Mastercard, Visa and American Express will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08119b95-ee26-4f64-be43-49c57c75b030\">suspend transactions in Russia</a>.</p> <p>In the short-term, the move will probably cause struggles for Russian consumers. But keep an eye on the uptake of Mir, the domestic system which Moscow has been trying to promote since 2014. Advocates of self-reliance are likely to have a field day. </p> <p>In other news, Imani chats to the founder of Nova Credit, which aims to help immigrants rebuild their financial lives; I speak to loyalty app Bink, which just inked a strategy partnership with Lloyds Banking Group; and Ukraine announces that it's planning an NFT series.</p> <p>As always, reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:imani.moise@ft.com\">imani.moise@ft.com</a> and <a href=\"mailto:sid.v@ft.com\">sid.v@ft.com</a> with thoughts and topics.</p> <h1>Russian-born fintech founder turns attention to Ukrainian refugees </h1> <p>As upwards of 1mn Ukrainians flee ongoing Russian attacks, Misha Esipov has spent the past week on the phone trying to help refugees with a challenge they will probably face down the road: getting access to credit.</p> <p>His company, Nova Credit, partners with credit reporting agencies around the world to create a standardised “credit passport” immigrants can use to access financial services when they move to a new country.</p> <p>Credit monitoring remains a fragmented industry with no uniform disclosure requirements and minimal communication between bureaus. That means migrants lose their credit histories when they move and often struggle to secure reasonable terms on loans for homes, cars, and other purchases that would help them re-establish their lives.</p> <p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked Europe's “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7772e7b4-4bbb-464b-be18-d27c58bf155e\">fastest growing refugee crisis</a>” since the second world war, according to the United Nations. But with the right preparations, Ukrainians may be able to re-establish their financial footing more smoothly than refugees from other nations, according to Esipov. </p> <p>“For the first time in history, we believe a data-based solution is possible,” he said. “Unlike the crises in Syria or Afghanistan, where the credit bureaus either don't exist or don't have any real coverage of the local population, Ukraine actually has a very robust and built-out credit system.”</p> <p>Ukraine has three major credit bureaus which claim to cover 80-90 per cent of the adult population. But creating transportable credit histories using data from its relatively new credit monitoring system will probably be difficult due to the decentralised lending landscape. The first credit reporting bureaus in Ukraine were licensed in 2007 and <a href=\"http://www.ier.com.ua/files/publications/Policy_papers/German_advisory_group/2012/0000017292-PP_04_2012_eng.pdf\">independent reports</a> have questioned the quality of the data. </p> <p>Non-banks that specialise in short-term cash lending are taking up a growing share of the consumer lending market. In March 2021, Ukraine's central bank reported that there were 73 banks and 2,009 non-banking financial services companies in the country. A <a href=\"https://www.fg.gov.ua/storage/files/dgf-survey-18may2020-en-covers.pdf\">nationwide survey</a> in 2020 found that 22 per cent of respondents had no bank account.</p> <p>Nova Credit is currently only set up to help individuals moving to the US — the vast majority of Ukrainians fleeing the war are seeking refuge in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6312a4ae-14bb-4540-bd33-2ceb8479d0fe\">Poland</a>. However, Esipov said he is nearly certain that refugees will continue to make their way west and “hundreds of thousands” will probably end up in North America.</p> <p>“I hope that the United States does its part in supporting the people of Ukraine,” he said. The number of refugees from Europe that the US can accept this year is currently capped at <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-03-06/explainer-what-is-the-us-doing-to-help-ukraine-refugees\">10,000</a> and the Biden administration has not yet announced plans to increase that limit.</p> <p>Since its founding in 2016, the San Francisco-based fintech has established partnerships with credit agencies in 20 countries including Mexico, India, and Nigeria, and is working on more international expansions that will address migrants relocating to other countries like the UK, Esipov said.</p> <p>Until recently, eastern Europe had not been a priority for Nova Credit since immigrants from countries in the region have made up less than 1 per cent of migrant flows into the US over the past decade, he said. And the company's efforts to make connections in the region, where Esipov was born and still has close family ties, have been unsuccessful. </p> <p>“Historically, we haven't been able to get a partnership off the ground anywhere in the former Soviet Union,” he said. </p> <p>Now, with continued Russian assaults on the nation, Espiov has struggled to even make contact with local Ukrainian credit agencies. </p> <p>“The reality of what we're hearing on the ground is that it is a very, very difficult situation for a lot of people and it's not quite the time or place to be conducting new business.”</p> <p>Still, he was able to start talks with one of the major Ukrainian bureaus, <a href=\"https://creditinfo.com/\">CreditInfo</a>, which is based in Iceland and already partners with Nova Credit in Kenya. Negotiations are ongoing. <em>(Imani Moise)</em></p> <h2>Quickfire Q&amp;A</h2> <p><em>I spoke with Mike Jordan, chief executive at Bink, which links bank cards to loyalty programmes in an effort to reduce reliance on traditional plastic card schemes. The UK-based fintech, which launched in 2015, has partnerships with some of the UK's biggest credit card providers: Barclays, since 2019, and Lloyds Banking Group since just earlier this month. In total it has raised around £45mn with investors including both Barclays and Lloyds. Jordan, who took over as chief executive in 2019, has previously worked at American Express and RailsBank.</em></p> <p><strong>What inspired the formation of Bink and what problems does it solve? </strong>Say you've got a payment card in hand, or a system like Apple Pay. It's good enough to get money from a bank account, why can't it do more? Why can't I get my loyalty points with it as well? There was a real recognition over a genuine consumer pain point. And payments have evolved significantly over the past 20 years. Think about the London Underground; we would find it crazy now to put in coins to get a paper ticket. But our ability to engage with retailers and brands, whether through membership or loyalty schemes, seems to have gotten left behind. </p> <p>Customers either don't join engagement schemes because they don't know they're there or they have disparate apps and log-ins to see how many points they've got. We've created a digital rendition of that membership card which you can see in the mobile banking environment when you pay. From a bank's perspective, it adds richness to a normal transaction and allows them to get much better data.</p> <p><strong>What are Bink's next targets? </strong>The key launch market is the UK, but we very much have global aspirations and a global team which is used to running businesses across multiple geographies. The key thing for us are the two biggest names, Barclays and Lloyds, which both have an equity investment in our business — but we look at that as slightly separate to our broader fundraising plans. Our next step as a business is taking this tech to a whole range of territories, and what you will see in the second quarter is active commercial discussions in countries such as Australia. The tech platform is super scalable and works globally, and the consumer pain point exists in many, many markets.</p> <p><strong>How has pandemic impacted the payments sector? </strong>The pandemic clearly had a huge impact on the retail environment in the UK. Obviously the pandemic grew online transactions massively, but how do you join the dots between knowing that person bought a lot from you online is actually showing back up in your store? I do think what's really valuable for our business is providing valuable data to the retailers so they can better serve customers. But I think there is also a broader theme from customers which is the desire for frictionless journeys, and you see it everywhere, from Amazon to British Airways. </p> <h1>Fintech Fascination</h1> <p><strong>Senior Democrat warns on tough crypto crackdown</strong> Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate finance committee and among the most powerful Democrats, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c5cb48a-6115-40cf-ac41-9b0ed9a744bf\">warned against overly tough regulations on cryptocurrencies</a>, writes Kiran Stacey, comparing the industry to the early internet.</p> <p><strong>Ukraine teases NFT plans </strong>Ukraine is planning to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4e13435-a818-4d80-94a4-4149a702a094\">launch a collection of NFTs</a>, seeking to capitalise on the crypto donations it is attracting to help it in the war against Russia. All of this unfolds against the backdrop of unease among <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/325864c5-01c5-4373-bdd2-aaa56400b30b\">western governments</a> around the use of crypto for circumventing sanctions on Russia.</p> <p><strong>Web3's convergence of speculation and idealism</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/879ae372-bb3b-4aa1-a264-ce32304a77d9\">Web3</a> is an amorphous term seemingly willed into existence by tech investors and now almost ubiquitous when talking about cryptocurrencies or digital assets more generally, Elaine Moore writes. The term is also a useful tool for companies seeking a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d40aac-034e-4e0b-95eb-c5d34146f647\">new start</a>.</p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan 2022 'How one Russian-born founder is trying to help Ukrainian refugees rebuild' FT.com 7 March.
