  "text": "<p>   After reading Andy Kessler's column, \"Blame Lockdowns on Silicon Valley\" (\"Inside View,\" Oct. 10), I'm surprised that no one has founded a new Luddite party, which I'd even join. He writes that \"laptops, Zoom, Amazon deliveries, cloud computing, Slack, QR codes [and] Netflix,\" all helped enable and prolong our Covid lockdown. Without all that, we'd have been forced to somehow muddle through Covid without severe social distancing mandates. The result would've likely been far less collateral damage to the economy, school kids and just about everyone else. </p><p>   As a new Luddite I don't advocate guerrilla attacks on server farms, but rather recommend deep, sober reflection on potential unintended consequences before bringing any new technology to market. Just because you can exploit technology to do something doesn't mean it deserves to be done. </p><p>   Exhibit A: The electric motorcycles, bikes and scooters that New York pedestrians have to dodge on the sidewalk daily. Like Netflix and the rest, that evil genie, I'm afraid, is already out of its bottle. </p><p>   Bill Apple </p><p>    New York </p><p></p>",
