  "title": "VC Daily: TripActions Tops $7 Billion Valuation as Business Travel Returns",
  "text": "<p>Founded in 2015, TripActions saw rapid growth from its early days as it aimed to disrupt a travel-and-expense software industry that was ripe for innovation, co-founder and Chief Executive Ariel Cohen said. But when the pandemic put traveling on ice in the spring of last year, the startup's revenue collapsed. \"Our entire revenue went down to zero overnight,\" Mr. Cohen said, referring to the sudden loss of the flat fees.</p><p>The crisis pushed the startup to cut 23% of its workforce, raise around $800 million in capital and expand beyond the U.S. market. TripActions said it is hiring again and currently has about 1,500 employees.</p><p>The latest financing comes as vaccine rollouts have helped economies reopen, giving the startup new momentum. TripActions more than doubled the travel budget it manages from February 2020 through July, while the expense budget grew 1400% over the same period, the company said.</p><p>Still, bans to some travel destinations mean the average budget of TripActions' clients has been below pre-pandemic levels. The startup was able to make up for that loss with the expansion of its client base and a pick-up in domestic and continental flights.</p><p>\"Today, I don't think we have one company on the platform that is not doing some kind of travel,\" Mr. Cohen said.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Autism treatment. Biotechnology startup Axial Therapeutics Inc. has raised $37.3 million in new venture capital to run clinical trials of a medicine designed to help people with autism who exhibit certain problematic behaviors, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Autism is a developmental disability that can affect social skills, communication, relationships and self-regulation. Axial is developing a medication for people who experience symptoms such as severe tantrums, mood swings and aggressive behavior.</p><p>The antipsychotic medications risperidone and aripiprazole have been approved in the U.S. to treat these behavioral symptoms associated with autism. Each can cause side effects including weight gain.</p><p>Axial's experimental medicine, which isn't an antipsychotic, is designed to work in the gut to reduce autism irritability. The drug could prevent certain substances produced by gut microbes from traveling to the brain, where they affect the ability of nerve cells to form strong connections with other nerve cells, according to Axial, which raised this funding to test its drug in new clinical trials.</p><p>$1.9 Billion</p><p>The amount General Motors Co. will receive from LG Electronics Inc. to cover the cost of recalling Chevrolet Bolt electric models for the risk of battery fires.</p><p>Europe Inc. Returns to the Skies</p><p>Europeans are flying again for business, as executives hit the road and airlines add flights to key destinations, The Wall Street Journal reports. The continent, one of the world's biggest aviation markets, was slower than the U.S. and China to return to the skies. A fast vaccination drive and the rollout of a vaccine passport program lifted vacation travel this summer. Now, business travel is bouncing back too. Businesses are also flying again in the U.S., though the spread of the Delta variant and delays to office reopenings have put a dent in that recovery. In September, European corporate trips were 49% of the 2019 level, compared with 42% in the U.S., according to travel-analytics company ForwardKeys.</p><p>Some Investors Find Stability in SPACs</p><p>Shares of special-purpose acquisition companies have lost their luster for those who recently saw them as a ticket to fast riches, WSJ reports. That is good news for a different group of investors, who treat them as an alternative to bonds. Known on Wall Street as SPAC arbitrage, the trade has become turbocharged of late—thanks in equal parts to the day-trader-fueled craze for special-purpose acquisition companies that materialized late last year and the more-recent slump in SPAC demand. While the mania helped increase the number of SPACs to 6 ½ times what it was in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, this year's rout has driven down share prices. That has created what some describe as a near risk-free opportunity that offers an attractive return compared with alternatives like short-term U.S. Treasurys.</p><p>Newsletter Special</p><p>Neythri Looks to Boost South Asian Representation in Investing</p><p>In her two-year career as a tech entrepreneur, Mythili Sankaran says she noticed a tremendous lack of diversity among founders and funders in the venture ecosystem. So this year, she launched the Neythri Futures Fund, which is focused on increasing the representation of South Asian women in startup investing.</p><p>Neythri just raised an oversubscribed $10 million in capital from 90% racially diverse limited partners.
