  "title": "U.S. News: FTC Pulls Guidance On Vertical Mergers",
  "text": "<p>\"I'm worried that the 2020 guidelines' misguided discussion of the purported pro-competitive benefits of vertical mergers could become difficult to correct if relied on by courts,\" Ms. Khan said.</p><p>Horizontal mergers that seek to combine direct rivals have long been considered potentially problematic, especially in concentrated markets. Vertical mergers integrate complementary companies, allowing the combined firm to expand into new or related businesses elsewhere in the supply chain. Those deals have often been viewed with far less skepticism, though the antitrust enforcement tide had begun to turn even before appointees of President Biden took office.</p><p>During the Trump administration, the Justice Department sought to challenge a major vertical deal -- AT&amp;T Inc.'s acquisition of Time Warner -- but lost in court.</p><p>The FTC this year voted unanimously to sue to block a vertical deal in which biotech company Illumina Inc. is acquiring Grail Inc., a company developing an early-detection blood test for cancer. Illumina has completed the deal but legal proceedings are continuing.</p><p>The FTC's decision to withdraw the vertical-merger guidelines came in a 3-2 vote along partisan lines, with Democrats in the majority.</p><p>In dissent, Republican Commissioner Noah Phillips said the move was the latest of several examples where the FTC under new Democratic leadership was abandoning policies but not replacing them with anything new, providing less guidance for business and \"knocking over guardrails that are intended to keep us from politicizing antitrust.\"</p><p>The FTC shares antitrust enforcement authority with the Justice Department, and Wednesday's move could, at least in the short term, create the impression of a diverging approach at the two agencies. The Justice Department didn't join in the withdrawal but in a statement said it was conducting a careful review of the policy, had identified some areas of concern and would collaborate with the FTC.</p><p>Separately Wednesday, the FTC announced the results of a study of tech-industry acquisitions of smaller companies, saying five top technology platforms -- Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Google owner Alphabet Inc. -- over a decadelong period had made 616 acquisitions that were above $1 million in value but didn't trigger the criteria for automatic deal review by the FTC or the Justice Department.</p><p>The study, launched last year, has come amid questions from antitrust enforcers and lawmakers about whether big tech firms engage in a pattern of acquisitions that collectively allow them to get bigger in a way that limits competition.</p><p>The FTC report didn't offer recommendations or conclusions, but commissioners said the data provided a more comprehensive picture of acquisition trends that would guide the agency's work.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
