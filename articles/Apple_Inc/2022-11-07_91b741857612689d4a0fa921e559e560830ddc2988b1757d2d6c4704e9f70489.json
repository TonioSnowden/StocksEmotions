  "text": "<p>Apple has warned that global shipments of its newest high-end iPhones will be delayed after China's zero-Covid lockdowns caused havoc at a factory run by main supplier Foxconn.</p> <p>The tech group made a rare announcement about iPhone delays on Sunday, just over a week after it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa6bec83-058f-4991-bb4f-0b294178f649\">warned of “significant” headwinds</a> to revenue growth due to the impact of a strong US dollar and supply constraints for its high-end models.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/a39a4558-f562-4dca-8774-000246e6eebe\">Apple</a> said demand for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models, whose popularity helped to drive iPhone revenue up 10 per cent last quarter, remained strong but added: “We now expect lower . . . shipments than we previously anticipated and customers will experience longer wait times to receive their new products.”</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/apple-iphone\">iPhone</a> powers about half of Apple's global sales, and the December quarter is typically its most lucrative period. Although Apple has repeatedly said that Covid-19 constraints have caused billions of dollars worth of supply issues throughout the pandemic, it has not issued such a warning outside of earnings calls since February 2020.</p> <p>The delays come as the situation worsens inside the world's largest iPhone factory, which Apple said was “currently operating at significantly reduced capacity”. The 200,000-person complex in central China, owned by manufacturing partner Foxconn, has seen a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7df7443c-226b-455a-8424-cc6c4a15787a\">worker exodus</a> to escape a Covid outbreak and being locked down in deteriorating living conditions.</p> <p>A 37-year-old worker surnamed He said on Monday the staff shortages at the Zhengzhou plant continued to increase. His warehouse, usually staffed with 200 people, had 90 employees left last week and only 65 people by Monday.</p> <p>“A lot of my colleagues were taken into quarantine,” said He, who has taken to sleeping on a board in the warehouse for fear of getting infected in the crowded dormitory rooms. “Everyone is nervous that they'll turn positive.”</p> <p>Another worker said his assembly line of 20 people had been reduced to three on Monday morning, after colleagues left and others tested positive for Covid, requiring long quarantines.</p> <p>Analysts have warned of worsening disruptions heading into winter after more than three-quarters of major Chinese cities reported new Covid cases in October.</p> <p>The supply constraints could further hamper year-on-year revenue growth for the December quarter, after Apple warned last month that revenues would “decelerate” from 8 per cent growth during the September quarter. </p> <p>Shares in Foxconn fell 0.5 per cent in early trading on Monday. Apple shares have fallen $800bn this year to a $2.2tn market capitalisation — still the highest among America's tech giants. </p> <p>Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies, said: “The restrictions on the factory are impacting what was already a reduced production and limiting supply of the two iPhones in higher demand.”</p> <p>Foxconn separately announced on Sunday that it would “revise down” its own outlook for the fourth quarter due to the lockdown in Zhengzhou, noting it was working with authorities to “stamp out the pandemic and resume production to its full capacity as quickly as possible”.</p> <p>The manufacturing group has been rushing to shift production to its other Chinese plants, but the Zhengzhou plant is responsible for 80 per cent of its iPhone 14 production capacity, according to analysts at research group Counterpoint. Last week, Foxconn quadrupled daily worker bonuses as it tried to lure workers back to production lines.</p> <p>On Saturday, Beijing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99693f8f-c9fd-4f0e-85dd-2fcff12853b3\">quashed market rumours</a> that it was considering easing China's strict zero-Covid restrictions, which had led to a surge in the price of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong last week.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Gloria Li in Hong Kong and Edward White from Seoul</em></p><p>Source: Patrick McGee and Tabby Kinder in San Francisco and Ryan McMorrow and Nian Liu in Beijing 2022 'Apple warns of iPhone shipment delays in wake of China Covid lockdowns' FT.com 7 November.
