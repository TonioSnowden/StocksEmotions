  "title": "Technology & Media:  Twitter Revamps Subscriber Service  ----  By Sarah E. Needleman and Alexa Corse",
  "text": "<p>   Twitter Inc. said Monday it reintroduced a new version of its paid subscription service, the second attempt in recent weeks by owner Elon Musk to launch the feature central to his goal of reducing the platform's reliance on advertising dollars. </p><p>   Twitter said new subscribers will get access to features, including the ability to edit tweets, upgraded video uploads and the company's famed blue checkmark after their account is reviewed for verification purposes. Twitter previously used the blue check marks for accounts it had deemed \"active, notable, and authentic accounts of public interest\" and that it had independently verified based on certain requirements. </p><p>   \"We're baaaack! Twitter Blue is now available,\" according to a tweet Monday from company account @TwitterBlue. Some users said they weren't able to subscribe shortly after the announcement. </p><p>    The revamped Twitter Blue represents one of several rapid-fire changes made by Mr. Musk since he bought the social-media platform in late October for $44 billion, including mass layoffs and an end to remote work for most remaining staffers. Mr. Musk has said he wants Twitter, which hasn't booked an annual profit since 2019, to rely less on advertising and more on alternative ways of making money, such as paid subscriptions. </p><p>   Twitter had to call off an earlier attempt to launch an enhanced version of Twitter Blue last month because of problems. In the hours immediately after Monday's announcement, some users said they weren't able to subscribe. </p><p>    Esther Crawford, a Twitter product executive, said such problems were likely because of what she called Twitter's \"impersonator defenses,\" including if an account had recently changed its username, profile photo or bio. </p><p>   Twitter also said that accounts must be at least 90 days old and have a confirmed phone number to subscribe to the new Twitter Blue. </p><p>   Some advertisers have paused spending on the platform amid concerns about Mr. Musk's ability to rein in objectionable content and other changes at the company, including executive departures. </p><p>   Last month Mr. Musk said Twitter was losing $4 million a day and he told employees that bankruptcy isn't out of the question. </p><p>   Mr. Musk has said he wants to diversify Twitter's revenue beyond advertising, which previously accounted for about 90% of its overall revenue. </p><p>   The cost of subscribing to the new Twitter Blue from an Apple Inc. mobile device is $11 a month, compared with $8 monthly for those who sign up from a web browser. Previously Mr. Musk had said the service would cost about $8 monthly, regardless of where the subscription was purchased. </p><p>   The difference in price for Apple and web users appears to reflect how Apple charges developers as much as 30% of subscriptions purchased through its App Store, a fee that falls to 15% after the first year of use. </p><p>   Mr. Musk complained on Twitter recently about Apple's cut of subscriptions, which has been the subject of criticism by some app developers for years. </p><p>    Alphabet Inc.'s Google Play store, which is on devices running its Android operating system, takes a 15% cut of subscription revenue. </p><p>   About 64% of Twitter users in the U.S. use Apple's mobile operating system for the iPhone or iPad compared with 36% who use Alphabet's Android, according to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower. </p><p>   Twitter initially launched the updated Twitter Blue on Nov. 5, marking the first significant product change since Mr. Musk's takeover. </p><p>   The revamped check marks were rolled out after the Nov. 8 midterm elections, and users quickly began exploiting them to impersonate brands and celebrities. Verified users falsely posed as LeBron James demanding a trade, George W. Bush attacking Iraqis and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. cutting insulin prices to zero. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Meghan Bobrowsky contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
