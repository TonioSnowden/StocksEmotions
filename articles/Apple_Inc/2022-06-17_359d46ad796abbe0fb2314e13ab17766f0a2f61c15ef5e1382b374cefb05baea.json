  "text": "<p>Rachna Ramachandran, a researcher at GMO, points out the higher yield means the asset class can absorb a lot more bad news. An 8.4% annual yield can absorb a default rate of 12% in the subsequent 12 months, which is a big jump given the default rate over the previous year has been about 1%. \"While that's likely to go up over the coming months, reaching a double-digit default rate that quickly would require a sizable credit shock,\" she says. Last month, S&amp;P projected the default rate in speculative grade companies could reach 3% by 2023.</p><p>That isn't to say that yields couldn't rise further. But, she says, yields would need to rise by almost 100 basis points in the next 6 months, or over 195 basis points in the next 12 months, before an investment now would be underwater.</p><p>Historically, at these yields, the 12-month returns have been enticing. The only time they weren't was during the global financial crisis. Which is another way of saying, in the absence of a deep recession, high-yield bonds now have a favorable risk/reward profile, she says.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Quadruple witching — the expiration of index futures and options, and single stock options and futures — takes place Friday.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba BABA surged 10% after Reuters reported that China's central bank has accepted an application from Ant Financialto set up a financial holding company.</p><p>Not only did the Bank of Japan not raise interest rates on Friday, it reaffirmed its yield control guidance.
