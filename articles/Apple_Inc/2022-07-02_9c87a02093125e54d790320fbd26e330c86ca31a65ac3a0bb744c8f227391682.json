Wade. </p><p>\n  The state's attorney general's office, led by Republican Steve Marshall, submitted a brief Monday asking a federal appeals court to remove an injunction blocking Alabama from enforcing the law, which bans surgery and other gender-affirming treatments such as hormones and puberty blockers for those who are under 19 years old. </p><p>\n  The attorney's general office made several citations of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. \"But no one -- adult or child -- has a right to transitioning treatments that is deeply rooted in our Nation's history and tradition,\" the attorney general's office wrote in the brief. \"The State can thus regulate or prohibit those interventions for children, even if an adult wants the drugs for his child.\" </p><p>\n  Jennifer Levi, the transgender rights project director for GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders, said she wasn't surprised to see Alabama relying on Dobbs to defend its ban on transgender medical treatments for children. </p><p>\n  \"We don't think, however, Alabama's use of Dobbs will gain much traction with the appeals court because the Supreme Court majority was so clear that the opinion has no application beyond abortion,\" she said. </p><p>\n  -- Joseph De Avila </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  WASHINGTON, D.C. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Medal of Freedom </p><p>\n  Recipients Named </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  President Biden selected more than a dozen people to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, including gymnast Simone Biles, the late Apple Inc. leader Steve Jobs, actor and director Denzel Washington and the late Sen.
