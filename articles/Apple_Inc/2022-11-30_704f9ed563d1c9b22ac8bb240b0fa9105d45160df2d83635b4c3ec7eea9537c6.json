  "text": "<p>Spotify SPOT dropped its hotly anticipated year-end list of what its 456 million users around the world listened to throughout 2022 on Wednesday. And Bad Bunny topped the global most-streamed artists list for the third year in a row, becoming Spotify Wrapped's first-ever \"three-peat\" winner in the most-streamed artists category, the company said.</p><p>Two of Bad Bunny's songs also made the top five list for most-streamed songs globally on Spotify, including \"Me Porta Bonito\" and \"Titi Me Pregunto.\" And his album \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" (\"A Summer Without You\") was the No. 1 most-streamed album globally on Spotify this year.</p><p>Apple Music named Bad Bunny its \"artist of the year\" for 2022 this week, as well, noting two of Bad Bunny's songs also made its top five list for most-streamed songs around the world, including \"Me Porta Bonito\" and \"Titi Me Pregunto.\" And his album \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" was also Apple Music's most streamed album of 2022, and is now the biggest Latin album of all time on the streaming service.</p><p>\"When I started, I didn't have a global fan base,\" Bad Bunny told Apple Music. \"I'm grateful for everything I've accomplished and everything I've experienced. The Latin music movement has grown so much. I would never take full credit or say, 'It's because of me.' No, it's every one of us. A whole generation. Our energy and presence is always felt.\"</p><p>Finally, Pandora's online radio service also reported that Bad Bunny took the most spots on its \"Top Twenty Thumbed Tracks of 2022\" list, aka Pandora listeners' most-loved songs of the year.</p><p>And when the 2023 Grammy nominees were announced earlier in November, Bad Bunny's \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" made history as the first album completely in Spanish to score an album of the year nomination. Bad Bunny, who has two Grammy wins under his belt already, also scored two nods for best pop solo performance and best m√∫sica urbana album for the February 2023 awards ceremony.</p><p>But Bad Bunny isn't the only one having a banner year.</p><p>Taylor Swift's latest album \"Midnights\" helped propel her to second place among the most-streamed artists of the year on Spotify Wrapped, with Drake, The Weeknd and K-Pop sensation BTS rounding out the top five most-streamed artists around the world. Many of these same artists also topped Spotify's most \"viral\" artists list, meaning their music was shared to social media platforms from Spotify the most frequently. Swift was the No. 1 most viral artist globally, followed by The Weeknd, Bad Bunny, BTS and Lana Del Rey.</p><p>Related: Taylor Swift's 'Midnights' album sets sales record in its first week</p><p>And some familiar faces topped the year's most popular podcasts on Spotify, as well, with \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" coming in as the most popular podcast for the third year in a row. Alex Cooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" advice and comedy podcast (formerly owned by Barstool Sports) took the second-place spot, with \"Anything Goes with Emma Chamberlain\" rounding out the top three most popular podcasts.</p><p>The year was also good for bringing back classic hit songs, with Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)\" topping the most-streamed throwback songs list thanks to its prominent needle drop in the fourth season of Netflix's NFLX \"Stranger Things\" that hit over the summer. Spotify said streams of Bush's 1985 hit increased more than 8,700% globally this year.</p><p>Related: 'Stranger Things 4' product visibility is worth up to $25 million for Coke, Jif and other brands</p><p>Speaking of retro classics, Spotify recorded a 660% spike in user-generated \"Coastal Grandmother\"-related play lights on Spotify, with nostalgic hits like Natalie Cole's \"This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)\" and \"My Girl\" from The Temptations becoming earworms once again.</p><p>Read more: From 'coastal grandmother' style to accessible farmhouse furniture, boomers are becoming popular among big brands</p><p>This comes as Spotify has joined Apple Music in mulling a price increase after CEO Daniel Ek forecast weaker margins following a slowdown in advertising growth in Spotify Technology S.A.'s most recent earnings call. Ek said he believes Spotify has \"significant pricing power,\" and raising its $9.99 individual monthly subscription fee in the U.S. (or $12.99 for two accounts, and $15.99 for family bundles) is something \"we would like to do.\" Apple raised the price of its Apple Music service to $10.99 a month for an individual plan, up from $9.99.</p><p>Read more: As Spotify stock sinks, CEO suggests raising prices for U.S. subscribers</p><p>Spotify SPOT stock is down almost 68% year-to-date, while Apple AAPL is down 20% so far this year.</p><p>Bad Bunny is the king of Spotify Wrapped and Apple Music 2022 charts</p>",
