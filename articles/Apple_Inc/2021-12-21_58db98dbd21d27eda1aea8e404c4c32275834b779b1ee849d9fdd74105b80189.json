  "text": "<p><em>This article is part of a&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/globetrotter/paris\"><em>guide to Paris</em></a><em>&#xa0;from FT Globetrotter</em></p> <p>The story of cinema begins in multiple locations, but all roads lead to Paris. On December 28 1895, motion-picture pioneers Auguste and Louis Lumière hosted their first commercial film screening in the basement of the Grand Café on Boulevard des Capucines. The brothers would quit the film business a few years later, but the baton was passed that evening. Among the crowd was Léon Gaumont, who would shortly found the world's first movie studio, and stage magician Georges Méliès, later director of the fabled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLVChRVfZ74\"><em>A Voyage to the Moon</em></a>. </p> <p>Paris and cinema always were a perfect match. The city was made to be a film set, an exquisite mosaic of history and novelty (the Eiffel Tower was just six years old when the Lumières came to the Grand Café). Only New York could rival it for charisma. And just as with New York movies, any modern list of the films that best capture that will run out of space before it runs out of titles. So the next trip will have to be where we include <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/\"><em>The 400 Blows</em></a> and Charles Laughton's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_p8khzyK-E&amp;t=1s\">Hunchback of Notre-Dame</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/28/chris-marker-la-jetee-film\"><em>La Jetée</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062229/\"><em>Le Samouraï</em>;</a> <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-cleo-from-5-to-7-1962\"><em>Cléo from 5 to 7</em></a> and, yes, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40e380b8-7743-11dc-9de8-0000779fd2ac\"><em>Ratatouille</em></a>. For now though, our tour starts here:</p> <h2>The Red Balloon (1956)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: available to stream on </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Balloon-Pascal-Lamorisse/dp/B01H0YOTG4\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em> and, in the US, </em><a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-red-balloon#:~:text=Albert%20Lamorisse's%20exquisite%20The%20Red,on%20the%20streets%20of%20Paris.\"><em>The Criterion Channel</em></a></p> <p>Could a more magical 35 minutes be spent in Paris than in the company of Albert Lamorisse's picture-book allegory? Beginning with a boy discovering a lost balloon on the steps of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pass.+Julien-Lacroix,+75020+Paris,+France/@48.8703895,2.3825333,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e66deeac1a9899:0x9d98c1065b2a909!8m2!3d48.8703895!4d2.3847273\">Passage Julien-Lacroix</a>, what follows is at once a heady children's adventure and a poignant time capsule of a rainy-day, flea-market Belleville now half-vanished.</p> <h2>Before Sunset (2004)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Before-Sunset-Ethan-Hawke/dp/B00HNJQHMQ\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/before-sunset/id295621095\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=before+sunset\"><em>YouTube</em></a><em> and other platforms</em></p> <p>Paris is for Parisians and everyone else too. In the middle chapter of Richard Linklater's much-cherished ‘Before' trilogy, both groups are represented. Ethan Hawke is the American writer in town for a reading at <a href=\"https://shakespeareandcompany.com/\">Shakespeare and Company</a>, Julie Delpy the local with whom he rekindles a great passion. Where else is a movie this lovestruck going to be set?</p> <h2>Les Amants du Pont-Neuf (1991)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Lovers-on-the-Bridge-Blu-ray/172139/\"><em>Blu-ray</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amants-Du-Pont-Neuf-DVD/dp/B002BAXBOE\"><em>DVD</em></a></p> <p>The real Paris is on screen in the grand portrait of <em>amour fou</em> made by director <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/where-begin-with-leos-carax\">Leos Carax</a>. (The first encounter between star-crossed Denis Lavant and Juliette Binoche takes place on Boulevard de Sébastopol.) But the Pont Neuf that mostly provides the stage was famously a fake, a model built in southern France amid a chaotic production. The wonder of the movie — spectacular and singular — is the way it still pulls you into the city so vividly.</p> <h2>L'Atalante (1934)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/LAtalante-Dita-Parlo/dp/B07K4V72ML\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/latalante/id1439269866\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=atalante\"><em>YouTube</em></a><em> and (US) </em><a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/l-atalante\"><em>The Criterion Channel</em></a> </p> <p>Almost 60 years before <em>Les Amants Du Pont-Neuf</em>, another firebrand young director told another story of love and trouble on the waterways. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/16/arts/jean-vigo-a-short-and-ferocious-life.html\">Jean Vigo</a>'s <em>L'Atalante</em> spends only some its story in Paris, but still paints it unforgettably as a place of glittering shop windows, seduction and danger. When the winter of 1933-4 allowed, Vigo shot outside at the Bassin de la Villette; the weather was believed to have hastened his death that year at just 29.</p> <h2>Girlhood (2014)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Girlhood-English-Subtitled-Karidja-Toure/dp/B00Z6RYTYA\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/girlhood-2014/id994182927\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=girlhood\"><em>YouTube</em></a><em> and other platforms</em></p> <p>For generations, Paris on film kept the <em>banlieues</em> out of sight. In 1995, the acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113247/reviews\"><em>La Haine</em></a> broke the mould. But a still more powerful story was <em>Girlhood</em>, director Céline Sciamma capturing in three heady chapters the life of a young woman from the blocks of Cité de la Noue in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/93170+Bagnolet,+France/@48.8670975,2.4164684,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e66d6fcb478cb7:0x40b82c3688b3c70!8m2!3d48.870364!4d2.4234589\">Bagnolet</a>. The movie was a lesson in how, even for a Parisian, a Métro journey to Les Halles can seem like a journey to another world. </p> <h2>Alphaville (1965)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alphaville-Eddie-Constantine/dp/B07DMTG74N\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/alphaville/id337784103\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and other platforms</em></p> <p>If <em>A Bout de Souffle</em> made Paris the capital of postwar European cinema, Jean-Luc Godard's sci-fi noir <em>Alphaville</em> finds the city taking a still bolder leap of the imagination, cast not as itself but the techno dystopia of the title. In lieu of special effects, Godard shot amid the modernist sheen of La Défense. And yet Paris past is on screen too. Detective Lemmy Caution was staying at <a href=\"https://www.sofitel-le-scribe-paris-opera.com/en/\">Le Scribe</a> hotel — opened on the site of the Grand Café where the Lumière brothers dazzled film-goers back in 1895. </p> <h2>Playtime (1967)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Playtime-Blu-ray-Jacques-Tati/dp/B00MBORJSE\"><em>Blu-ray</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Playtime-DVD-Jacques-Tati/dp/B00MBORIZI/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=playtime+tati&amp;qid=1639598287&amp;s=dvd&amp;sr=1-2\"><em>DVD</em></a><em> and (US) </em><a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/playtime\"><em>The Criterion Channel</em></a></p> <p>Godard was not the only titan to point Paris towards things to come. In 1967, comic maestro Jacques Tati made <em>Playtime</em> — an ambitious, brilliant and financially disastrous account of a trip to a futuristic vision of the city, featuring the timeless mishaps of Monsieur Hulot (played by Tati). The vast and intricate sets — dubbed “Tativille” — saw the conventional city reduced to the Eiffel Tower and Sacré-Coeur flashing by in the reflection of a glass door. </p> <h2>An American in Paris (1951)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Paris-Gene-Kelly/dp/B00FYHTN2U\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/an-american-in-paris/id283258245\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=an+american+in+paris\"><em>YouTube</em></a><em> and other platforms</em></p> <p>Another glorious confection of paint and timber, <em>An American in Paris</em> is the city as seen through the prism of Golden Age Hollywood. Every set is a thing of wonder. If the jaw still drops at the climactic Gershwin ballet before a series of Parises in the style of great painters, save your amazement too for Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron's Seine-side dance to “Our Love Is Here to Stay”.</p> <h2>Diva (1981)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diva-Special-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B08992BF2T\"><em>Blu-ray</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diva-DVD-Wilhelmenia-Fernandez/dp/B000KRNMJ4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=diva+dvd&amp;qid=1639599354&amp;s=dvd&amp;sr=1-1\"><em>DVD</em></a></p> <p>“Cinéma du look” was the 1980s phrase applied to the movies of a band of upstart young French film-makers. But when was Paris not about the look? The city rarely came more stylised than in the debut of director Jean-Jacques Beineix, the tale of a young postman obsessed with an American soprano, drawn into a swirl of gangsters and blackmail. If every great city needs a great subway sequence, <em>Diva</em> provides it for Paris, the hero racing his moped down into the Métro at Concorde for a mesmeric chase scene.</p> <h2>Céline and Julie Go Boating (1974)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Celine-Julie-Boating-Juliet-Berto/dp/B073X4LKP6\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em> and (US) </em><a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/celine-and-julie-go-boating\"><em>The Criterion Channel</em></a></p> <p>Director Jacques Rivette was specific about the address of the rambling house in his rabbit-hole tale of swapped identity: 7 bis Rue du Nadir aux Pommes. Typical of the slippery logic at work is that, while <a href=\"https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/celine-julie-go-boating-jacques-rivette-paris-locations\">the house itself is real, the address is wholly fictitious</a>. It makes the perfect emblem for a film that from the opening mad pursuit through Montmartre onwards treats the city as puzzle and playground.</p> <h2>Rififi (1955)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rififi-Blu-ray-Jean-Servais/dp/B00OYT9X6K\"><em>Blu-ray</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rififi-DVD-Jean-Servais/dp/B00008MJ0G\"><em>DVD</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/rififi/id903317994\"><em>iTunes</em></a></p> <p>Made just a year before <em>The Red Balloon</em>, Jules Dassin's heist movie was proof that very different stories go on in the same city. The two films even shared a location on the picturesque steps at Passage Julien-Lacroix. But Rififi began not with a lost balloon but a mob of crooks scoping out jeweller Mappin &amp; Webb near Place Vendôme. From there, without the budget to shoot on soundstages, Dassin would make a bristling <em>verité</em> portrait of hard-edged postwar Belleville.</p> <h2>Holy Motors (2012)</h2> <p><em>Where to watch: </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Holy-Motors-Denis-Lavant/dp/B00IM76BYW\"><em>Amazon Prime</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/holy-motors/id566369002\"><em>iTunes</em></a><em> and other platforms</em></p> <p>Two decades after Les Amants Du Pont-Neuf, Leos Carax returned to Paris to make a film as gorgeous, melancholy and miscellaneous as the city it was set in. To begin our screwball journey, the movie carried us into town on the Autoroute de l'Ouest in a white stretch limousine. Sights to come included a manic excursion through Père-Lachaise cemetery, a heartbreak serenade on the roof of famed department store La Samaritaine — and, most thrilling of all, a grand march of accordions through the cloisters of the <a href=\"https://saintmerry.org/#infos\">Eglise Saint-Merry</a> on Rue Saint-Martin. Like Paris itself, the movie was at once a collection of beyond-famous landmarks — and nothing but surprises.</p> <p><em>What are your favourite Paris-set films?
