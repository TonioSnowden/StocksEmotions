  "title": "NFL launches streaming service, but it has serious limitations; NFL+ launches for mobile devices starting at $4.99 a month, but out-of-market regular-season games are still out of reach",
  "text": "<p>The service, which launched Monday, includes live, out-of-market preseason games; live local and primetime games, both for the regular season and playoffs; live local and national audio for every game; on-demand NFL Network shows, NFL Films archives and more.</p><p>But the service comes with a few caveats: For one, viewers will only be able to watch on their phones or tablets — not on their TVs. And live local and prime-time games had previously been available to stream for free from the NFL's mobile app. Also, subscribers can't watch out-of-market regular-season games, unlike the similar subscription services for the NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball.</p><p>\"Today marks an important day in the history of the National Football League with the launch of NFL+,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing to grow NFL+ and deepening our relationship with fans across all ages and demographics, providing them access to a tremendous amount of NFL content, including the most valuable content in the media industry: live NFL games.\"</p><p>Live sports, especially NFL games, are by far the most popular programming for TV and cable networks. Last year, 95 of the 100 most-watched telecasts were live sports, and 75 of those were NFL games, according to Sports Business Journal data.</p><p>A number of companies — including Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, and Disney's DIS ESPN — are currently competing for broadcast rights for the NFL Sunday Ticket package (which shows out-of-market games) beginning in 2023, with the league reportedly seeking a price tag around $2.5 billion. The New York Times reported Sunday that Alphabet's GOOGL GOOG YouTube has also joined the fray. Apple is reportedly seen as the front-runner in those negotiations.</p><p>The NFL's exhibition season kicks off Aug. 4, with the Jacksonville Jaguars playing the Las Vegas Raiders in the Hall of Fame game. The regular season starts Sept. 8.</p><p>NFL launches streaming service, but it has serious limitations</p>",
