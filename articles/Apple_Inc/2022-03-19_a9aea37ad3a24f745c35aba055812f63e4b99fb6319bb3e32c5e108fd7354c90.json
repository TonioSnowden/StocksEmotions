  "text": "<p>   Ultimately, Mr. Lawson decided it was important for Twilio to operate in Russia, particularly with nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations that are trying to help Russian citizens get accurate information. The Norwegian Refugee Council was using Twilio's WhatsApp interface to communicate with people affected by the crisis as volunteers on the ground arranged housing, food and basic needs, he said. </p><p>   Micha Kaufman's company, Fiverr International Ltd., runs a marketplace for freelance workers. He didn't want to penalize its Russian workers for a situation out of their control, but the Russian financial system was shutting down. \"Essentially Russians have no way to pay or get paid,\" Mr. Kaufman said. \"Even if we want to work in Russia, it's impossible.\" </p><p>   On March 9, Fiverr said it would suspend operations in Russia while allowing Russians to withdraw their existing earnings from the platform. The business is small, but the devastation from the war and financial sanctions on Russia drove the decision. \"There's a lot of pressure from all sides to close or keep open or join other companies,\" Mr. Kaufman said. \"It's important that we do things the way we usually do things, and not because other companies or people are calling to do certain stuff.\" </p><p>   For Lynn Good, CEO of Duke Energy Corp., Russia's aggression raised a worry closer to home: the risk of cyberattacks on the U.S. electric grid. </p><p>   Her company, which provides electricity and natural gas to customers in several U.S. states, has been on alert months before the Russian invasion, she said. </p><p>   \"We have been in a state of preparedness that is very heightened, monitoring everything, sharing information in a way that is really important for a moment like this,\" she said, adding that Duke has been in regular contact with the U.S. government and FBI. </p><p>   Cybersecurity firm Rapid7 Inc., which has more than 10,000 customers, had been preparing for such threats since mid-February. </p><p>   For CEO Corey Thomas, the invasion started in the middle of a vacation week. He was at Walt Disney World with his family standing near the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train when the news alerts started popping up about Russia. </p><p>   \"How are we going to deal with this from a personnel perspective?\" Mr. Thomas thought. That day, he had his AirPods in and iPhone out, using voice text and calls to connect with staff and customers while also plotting out the family's next ride. </p><p>   Mr. Thomas said the company has seen cybercriminals trying to use the uncertain environment of the war to their advantage, such as phishing attacks tailored to helping Ukraine or humanitarian aid, but it has been largely business as usual. His firm is working with multinational companies that have operations in Russia but stopped new business from customers whose primary location is in Russia or Belarus. \"We do expect escalations and we're really watching the spillover,\" he said. \"One of the big things: Russians are really good at malware. Malware is really hard to contain.\" </p><p>   By the third week of fighting, there were more than 3 million refugees from Ukraine, according to the United Nations. </p><p>   Airbnb Inc. CEO Brian Chesky suggested in a team meeting just before the invasion that the company be prepared to offer free housing to 20,000 refugees. The number matched a previous commitment by the home-sharing service for Afghan refugees. </p><p>   Two days into the war, Mr. Chesky realized it wasn't going to be enough. He began calling people he thought could help cover the costs of additional housing. Among them: actor Ashton Kutcher, an early Airbnb investor, and his Ukrainian-born wife, Mila Kunis. </p><p>   The couple started a GoFundMe campaign for Airbnb.org, the company's nonprofit arm. Donations poured in. </p><p>   At 6 p.m. that Saturday, Mr. Chesky called an executive meeting to announce that Airbnb would provide free stays to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. \"If we were around during World War II, how would we want to be remembered?\" he told them. \"I want us to be one of those companies that stepped up.'\" </p><p>   On March 3, Airbnb suspended bookings in Russia and Belarus. The region was a sliver of Airbnb's business and sanctions were making it difficult to continue paying hosts. </p><p>   The same day, Mr. Chesky noticed something unusual. Hosts in parts of war-ravaged Ukraine were getting a surge in bookings from guests who didn't intend to show up. People were booking Airbnb stays as a way to send money to Ukrainians. </p><p>   The CEO was stumped. The service wasn't designed for such donations -- hosts are paid after guests check out and the platform can flag same-day stays as fraudulent if guests aren't in the same geography as hosts. </p><p>   Mr. Chesky created a team to accelerate payments to hosts and removed blockers that would otherwise flag such stays. He waived Airbnb's service fee on all Ukraine bookings. As of March 11, Ukrainian hosts had received more than $15 million in such donations. </p><p>   \"In a world of darkness and destruction,\" he said, \"it was a reminder that kindness still exists.\" </p><p></p>",
