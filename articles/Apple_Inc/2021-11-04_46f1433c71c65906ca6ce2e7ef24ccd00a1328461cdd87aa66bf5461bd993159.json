  "text": "<p>Investors still sent shares up 6% in after-hours trading immediately following the report. On the positive side, Pinterest's third-quarter revenue beat analysts' forecast—a sign its platform may have been more insulatedfrom Apple's recent privacy changes than its social-media competitors. That outcome is somewhat surprising, given Pinterest has said the majority of its advertisements are direct-response ads, or those that elicit immediate clicks or conversion. These ads depend upon some of the very tracking that Apple's changes have recently diminished.</p><p>For advertisers, that insulation should underscore some of the potential value proposition Pinterest's platform can bring. The company is in the midst of launching a seamless checkout experience for purchases on its platform. Once the feature is broadly rolled out, the hope is that users will regularly come to Pinterest with shopping intent, discover new brands and purchase products all in one visit. Having users search for and discover products all through its own app means that tracking off-app user activity is less important to demonstrate returns on advertisers' investments, making Pinterest even more Apple-proof.</p><p>But Pinterest needs growing and engaged users for that to work. User behavior on Pinterest seems to have changed during the pandemic. The company said it is now seeing strength from out-of-home use cases like fashion and makeup but weakness in what have historically been core use cases like in-home cooking, home décor and crafts. When user behavior will fully revert—if ever—is unclear.</p><p>In the U.S., where the majority of Pinterest's revenue is derived, the company has been trying to expand from a rather niche user base of moms. While the pandemic saw younger users filter in, many haven't stuck. Pinterest specifically attributed some of the third quarter's slowdown in user growth to Gen Z returning back to school.</p><p>Users aren't the only ones walking away from Pinterest. Last month, the image-sharing company was reportedly being courted by PayPal Holdings toward a potential $40 billion-plus takeover. But the supposed interest was brief, ending just days after deal talks first leaked. The Wall Street Journal reported that shareholders at the payments company balked at the combination, with Pinterest's declining share price reportedly at issue. Its recent user losses probably didn't help.</p><p>On Thursday, Pinterest described the near-term impact on engagement from the pandemic unwind as \"unknown.\" With that in mind, the company guided for fourth-quarter revenue to grow \"in the high teens\" from a year earlier. Wall Street had been expecting nearly 24% growth.</p><p>Pinterest seems to be getting dumped lately by users and suitors alike. Reaction to its third-quarter results suggest it still has some loyal investors to help pick up the pieces, but even they may have their limits.</p><p>Write to Laura Forman at laura.forman@wsj.com</p><p>Pinterest's Mood Swings</p>",
