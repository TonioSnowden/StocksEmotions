  "title": "This fund driven by artificial intelligence is ditching big tech. Here's what it's doing instead.",
  "text": "<p>The artificial-intelligence Powered Equity ETF AIEQ seems to have caught on. It's an exchange-traded fund that uses IBM Watson to pick stocks, and now it doesn't have any of the megacap tech giants in its top 10 holdings. Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research, points out that as recently as September, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon and Alphabet were its top four positions, making up nearly a quarter of the exchange-traded fund. Even in November, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon accounted for about 15% of the fund. Now, only Apple of the FAANG stocks is in the portfolio.</p><p>What is the fund doing now? It still has a smattering of tech stocks in its top 10, led by microchip maker Advanced Micro Devices AMD, but also investments including diabetes monitoring system maker Dexcom DXCM and electrical-system maker Eaton ETN. There's also a bit of a cybersecurity theme with both Palo Alto Networks PANW and Fortinet FTNT in its top 10.</p><p>“AIEQ has been diversifying its holdings in a host of industries and putting most of its capital to work. That's in contrast to this past September, for example, when it placed more concentrated investments in well-known companies amid that choppy month for U.S. equities. This latest approach reflects the current positive investment environment with the S&amp;P near record highs,” says Rabe.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Tesla TSLA CEO Elon Musk sold another $1 billion of stock in the electric-vehicle maker, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, to pay the taxes for the exercise of a 1.55 million share option. That should wrap up his preplanned stock sales for this year.</p><p>Apple AAPL is reportedly paying up to $180,000 to prevent employees from moving to tech rivals including Meta Platforms FB, according to Bloomberg News.</p><p>The trade deficit in goods ballooned by 17.5% in November, the Commerce Department reported. Retail inventories rose by 2%, and wholesale inventories rose by 1.2%, the same report said. Pending home sales data is due shortly after the open.</p><p>The World Health Organization reported that the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide climbed 11% last week, with Europe having the highest infection rate of any region.</p><p>The market</p><p>Stock futures ES00NQ00 were flattish after a pause in the rally on Tuesday.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y edged up to 1.52%. One big move was in European natural-gas contracts, with the lead U.K. contract GWM00 tumbling 5% as a combination of warmer weather, U.S. supplies and Norwegian output moved prices off recent highs.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>Here are the top tickers on MarketWatch, as of 6 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Ticker          Security name  TSLA            Tesla  AMC             AMC Entertainment  GME             GameStop  DXY             U.S. dollar index  DJIA            Dow Jones Industrial Average  ES00            E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures  NIO             NIO  AAPL            Apple  BX:TMUBMUSD10Y  U.S. 10 Year Treasury  NVDA            Nvidia</p><p>Random reads</p><p>This tax maneuver from the 1990s is now helping Silicon Valley tycoons save tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>These brothers have re-gifted the same candy since 1987.</p><p>Need to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
