  "text": "<p>At ground level, life is far from grim. Scented yellow Wintersweet has been wonderful in lockdown. Winter aconites are absurdly early, like gold spangles in rough grass. Snowdrops are early too and such a heartening sight that I may break a self-imposed rule and give them an entire column next month. </p> <p>For now, it is time to look forwards, start planning and place orders to the best advantage. Work done in February keeps us up to speed throughout the true growing season.</p> <p>For new or potential gardeners, I am going to be selective. In my mind's eye I see you with a new suburban or rural garden after a flight from a locked-down city centre. What a fine idea more space seemed last summer. A garden, fresh vegetables and herbs, the lot, but how do you begin to turn the idyll then into reality now?</p> <p>I will help you with a Magnificent Seven, seven families of shrubs that a new garden of any size needs to contain. Garden centres are still functioning and so are crocus.co.uk, a major source for orders of plants online, and ashwoodnurseries.com, for online lists and an excellent mail-order service. </p> <p>Remember that ordering is only half the battle. Soil preparation is the other half, not to be treated as a shortcut. Everything I will name is better for a good mixture of chopped manure and a dash of Growmore fertiliser worked into the garden soil. Prepare a rectangular hole, not a round one, and plant to the level at which the soil has already reached on the plant you buy.</p> <p>Begin with a magnolia. Many gardeners did so in the pre- and postwar eras and we bless their efforts every spring. Now that the British spring is milder, magnolias are less at risk to the sharp nights of frost that turn their flowers brown. I would start with the well-known Magnolia soulangeana, the one whose white flowers have a purple stain at their base.</p> <p>The pure white form, soulangeana alba, is even lovelier and I never tire of its breeder's fine announcement on taking up gardening. Soulange-Bodin had served as a cavalry officer in Napoleon's armies, but returned after 1815 to breed plants. </p> <p>“The Germans have encamped in my garden, I have encamped in the gardens of the Germans; and it was with sword in hand that I visited the botanical collections of Vienna, Minden, Stuttgart and Moscow. It had doubtless been better for both parties to have stayed at home . . . ” </p> <p>Instead, he believed “the rising taste for gardening becomes one of the most agreeable guarantees of the repose of the world”. It still is.</p> <p>I am now going to cheat. I will list camellias and rhododendrons outside my Seven, as they are essential choices for gardens on acid soil. If in doubt, ask the neighbours and find out if they can grow these lime-hating plants or not. </p> <p>Whatever the answer, buy a viburnum too. Their scented white flowers and, usually, grey-green leaves are essential in late April. Try Viburnum burkwoodii as an unusual choice for a north or east-facing wall. In the main garden plant the superbly scented Viburnum carlesii, in one of its named variations. For June, try the excellent Viburnum hillieri and enjoy its cream-yellow flowers along horizontal branches.</p> <p>For May, look for lilacs, the syringas in nursery lists. The dark purple-flowered Charles Joly is one which will grow and flower anywhere, but I also love the sky-blue Firmament, a wonderful flower for cutting and using indoors. Sensation has flowers criss-crossed with white and is another winner. Last year was a superb year for lilacs. Do not be caught without them in a new garden.</p> <p>Out of many possibles, I have two easy favourites for June. One is the free-flowering beauty bush, a marvellously obliging shrub that is only hindered by its official name, Kolkwitzia amabilis. The plant behind it is unforgettable, up to 6ft tall and wide and covered in pink flowers like small trumpets with yellow throats. It has had an excellent run in recent seasons and begins its flowering ever earlier.</p> <p>Within a week or so of its opening, I know it will be the time to enjoy mock orange blossom, or philadelphus. Its superb scent makes it an essential first choice. For difficult places in shade, there is Philadelphus coronarius, which will flower sweetly and persist. Very hot sites are not to the others' liking, either, and the loveliest of them is Belle Etoile, the best for scent and impact at a height of about 6ft. </p> <p>The flowers are white with a purple blotch at their base and, as the temperature drops, their scent becomes exquisite, the dreamiest accompaniment to an English summer evening. If branches of it are picked for vases indoors, the flowers will scent an entire room. This fine shrub loses its leaves in winter, but makes a lovely hedge if spaced at intervals of about 5ft.</p> <p>These two choices for high summer need to be pruned immediately after flowering. All branches with old flowers on them should be cut back then, because next year's flowers appear on the new growth that will result. Well-timed pruning keeps them to a manageable shape. Never prune them later, let alone in winter or spring, as you will sabotage an entire season of flower. If in doubt, leave them alone.</p> <p>I will dither over number six. On acid soil it could be a white-flowered eucryphia for August. In sheltered places it could be the fast-growing, white-flowered Hoheria Glory of Amlwch. I will play safe and opt for buddleias, abundant flowerers everywhere in August to September. </p> <p>The grey-leaved Lochinch is still hard to beat, as its leaves are less coarse than those on the big-flowered whites and purples. Blue Horizon is its equal, and if you want even neater leaves, the lavender blue Glasnevin Hybrid is a good option, although its flowers fade quickly and it needs regular dead heading. The newish Buzz series is also excellent at a lower height of about 4ft. </p> <p>Buddleias need to be pruned hard in spring but by delaying this cut until early May you can delay their flowers too. Plant several, cut them at different times in March to April and stagger their seasons.</p> <p>Number seven is the hardest to select. Now that winters begin so warmly it has to be an early winter-flowering shrub, and there are many temptations here. For scent and evergreen leaves I opt for a mahonia. Mahonia Charity has impressive spikes of flower but less scent than plain japonica. Even an old mahonia can be cut back hard after flowering to stop it becoming bare at the base. This pruning seems harsh but it keeps the plant tidy.</p> <p>Seven a side is an exclusive team. Dozens of candidates are protesting on the subs' bench: ceanothus, deutzias, daphnes galore, low-growing potentillas, scented winter sarcococca. How can I have omitted a forsythia or a flowering currant, a ribes, but most newly acquired gardens will have them already? A Magnificent Seven is only a way to begin choosing. The next happy problem is one of deciding when to stop.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
