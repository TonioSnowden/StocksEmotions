  "title": "What to Stream: Two New Dramas To Watch",
  "text": "<p>(Epix, Epix Now)</p><p>In this new 10-part drama that premieres Sunday on Epix and the Epix Now streaming service, Adrien Brody plays Capt. Charles Boone, a recently widowed husband, a father of three and the inheritor of a large family home and sawmill in Preacher's Corner, Maine, in the mid-1800s.</p><p>Though the Captain and his children are new arrivals to Preacher's Corner, their name and family home, Chapelwaite, have long been associated with darkness and have recently been blamed for a mysterious illness making its way through the town. Once they settle in and hire a governess -- played by Emily Hampshire of \"Schitt's Creek\" -- the family develops its own suspicions about the home.</p><p>The series is based on Stephen King's short story \"Jerusalem's Lot.\" Mr. Brody says that when he read the script, he was taken by Boone's complex character as a tortured man and father who fights for his children, but who also isn't a caricature of a hero. He isn't without fear, Mr. Brody notes.</p><p>\"All those imperfections need to be captured in a depiction of the heroic character,\" he says. \"And more often than not, they're not incorporated on that level. I feel like I was given quite a lot of breadth to represent all of that within Charles Boone.\"</p><p>New Release: 'The Chair'</p><p>(Netflix)</p><p>Dr. Ji-Yoon Kim takes over as the head of a university's English department, becoming the first woman to hold the role and one of the faculty's rare persons of color. Her staff includes professors who don't think she can lead the department and others anxious for change.</p><p>Played by Sandra Oh, Dr. Kim also has to contend with Jay Duplass's Bill Dobson. The former chair of the department is now her subordinate, and his life is in shambles. He is still dining out on his early success -- and doesn't think their professional relationship should get in the way of an intimate one.</p><p>Amanda Peet co-created and largely wrote \"The Chair,\" a six-part, three-hour dramatic comedy that premieres Friday on Netflix. Best known for her roles in movies like \"Syriana\" and \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and TV shows like \"Brockmire,\" Ms. Peet says she was drawn to the idea of women and women of color who go first.</p><p>\"I was really interested in: What is it like to have to do the actual job itself, but then on top of that to have to navigate all of this subliminal and sometimes overt shit that's being thrown at you?\" she says.</p><p>Program Note: 'Physical'</p><p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>The series starring Rose Byrne as a 1980s housewife who becomes an aerobics pioneer has been picked up for a second season.</p><p>Bobby Cannavale -- a star in the new Hulu series \"Nine Perfect Strangers\" and Ms. Byrne's longtime partner -- says that while she was preparing for the role he never knew when she was practicing. So, he would come home from work and find her using the living room as an aerobics studio.</p><p>\"It was very funny to watch that progress,\" he says, \"because she'd be the first one to tell you, she's not like a natural mover, let's say. She came a long way.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
