  "title": "Arts in Review -- Television Review: 'Suspicion': Undergirded With Irony --- The son of a powerful executive -- and recently appointed ambassador -- is abducted in this trans-Atlantic thriller",
  "text": "<p>In this confidently ambitious, taut and not infrequently exhausting tale of abduction, family lives are upended. And what, you may ask, is unusual about that? \"Suspicion\" (begins with two episodes Friday, Apple TV+) quickly begins delivering the answer in it's eight richly complicated parts, all saturated with steely irony: The series is, in short, not without humor of a bitter kind.</p><p>Based on the Israeli TV thriller \"False Flag,\" \"Suspicion\" takes its grim fun-poking seriously. The abductors who pounce on their victim and stuff him violently into a suitcase wear revoltingly cheery face masks -- all caricatures of the Royal Family. That victim, Leo Newman (Gerran Howell), is the 20-ish son of Katherine Newman, prominent American head of a high-powered U.S. public-relations firm (a thoroughly persuasive Uma Thurman) now on her way to take up her new role as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom.</p><p>In the chaos that follows the abduction, which took place in an upscale New York hotel, there will be less and less about the fate of Leo, which isn't to say that his mother isn't in anguish over his plight. She's immensely comforted by an American arrival in London (the series moves back and forth between New York and London for reasons that will soon be obvious). He's FBI agent Scott Anderson, and he's played by Noah Emmerich, unforgettable star of \"The Americans,\" where he also played an FBI man. Mr. Emmerich has, for this role, though, been given a tongue tic that produces irritating sounds for reasons best known to the show's creators. His is, nonetheless, a shining presence as he brings reason and experience to the search for Leo and his abductors.</p><p>The investigation is largely conducted in England because the suspects identified by the police in the immediate aftermath of the abduction were British. And in the focus on the arrests of people under suspicion of being connected to the conspiracy (the British police are careful to note the possible categories -- it could be related to terrorism, or to score a payout for the victim's release) the story comes roaring to life. This is thanks, not least, to the irresistible power of scenes involving the end of normal life for persons of interest.</p><p>The portrayal of the cops doing their duty is admirable in its restraint in this portrait of the most obviously innocent suspects being singled out publicly for possible involvement in this crime -- one making headlines around the world. We see the police entering a college classroom and, with badges flashing and an apology for the timing, telling the suspect -- the female instructor -- she has to come with them. It takes a higher form of professional confidence, to be sure, for the police to break into wedding ceremonies. The scenes may be packed with implicit rebuke, and shock at officers of the law who would go marching into a church as they do in one scene. Just as the glowing bride arrives at the altar, the police enter and take her away. To underscore what has happened to her this day, she's shown walking to the car, her bridal train carried by somebody from the police. Still there is nothing that feels like caricature of the enemy -- the police -- and it is this delicacy that imbues these encounters with vivid life. In place of hysterics, chilling overhead camera shots show silent men and women locked in narrow cells -- they look benumbed, they stare at the ceilings.</p><p>None of this is to say the bitterness of all that has happened to them doesn't summon a furious eloquence. Told by a police investigator of the possibility that life could become whole again for her, the bride whose wedding was invaded erupts: Did the officer realize all that had gone into that day; how it was the product of two years' planning; that so many people had spent money to come, money that they didn't have? Who was going to help her become whole again?</p><p>The police have no answers to the whereabouts of Leo and his captors, or to the question of whether Leo is still alive. A tone of alarm, dictated by experience, begins to surface. Mysterious messages are breaking through online that could be coming from the gang that captured him, messages that consist of three words: \"Tell the Truth.\" A police investigator has become worried -- doing business with abductors who ask for no material payment, kidnappers interested in a very different kind of reward, are, she concludes, far more dangerous than those who do.</p><p>By the time the eight parts of this saga near their end, it is clear that the ubiquitousness of \"Tell the Truth\" has become a battle cry linked to the abduction, a slogan whose three now-haunting words are carried by mobs of militants marching through the streets.</p><p>None of this is surprising in a work as loaded with social messaging as this one is -- the kind whose extraordinary details are best not revealed here. What can be said is that this is political-thriller territory of a special kind, as riveting as it is complex.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
