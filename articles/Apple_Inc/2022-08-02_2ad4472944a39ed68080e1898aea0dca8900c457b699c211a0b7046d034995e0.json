  "title": "Can the New Chevy Bolt EUV Win Back America's Trust? After recalling its first mass-produced, long-range EVs due to battery fires a few years ago, the Detroit automaker has reinvented the line. Dan Neil has high hopes.",
  "text": "<p>But I couldn't help myself. As I watched neighbors and dog-walkers peer hungrily through the windows of the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV—a slightly huskier version of the refreshed Bolt EV, now with less flammable batteries—I quietly hoped it was enjoying the attention. That little bugger has been through some things.</p><p>Debuting for model-year 2017, the Bolt (midsize four-door hatchback) was GM's first mass-produced, long-range EV, the younger sibling to the Volt plug-in hybrid. With well-equipped models priced under $40,000 (including the $7,500 federal tax credit then available) and a reliable 200 miles of range between charges, the Bolt was a peppy paragon of appropriateness. All of Vulcan rejoiced.</p><p>In retrospect, it's clear GM's enthusiasm for EVs was not quite there yet: Marketing didn't support the Bolt; manufacturing didn't scale to meet demand; and sales/service were like, What? No. We need Silverados.</p><p>And then came the battery fires. After two years of headlines about fleetwide recalls and Do Not Drive orders, I figured the only tire-kickers would be pyromaniacs. But look at all these nice people. It's amazing what $5 a gallon gas has done for the little Chevy's sex appeal.</p><p>The cause of the fires was determined to be a glitch in the manufacturing of the pouch-style cells by supplier LG Chem. The problem was identified and remedied, with the fix being baked into the battery modules for new cars and those replacing recalled units. The new packs, assembled in Michigan, are limited-warrantied for eight years and 100,000 miles.</p><p>GM seemed to have handled the recall well. Repairing the Bolt's image will be harder.</p><p>Look, I've got no one to talk to. I'm reduced to spying on my neighbors from behind the drapes like Mrs. Kravitz. Can I just share? The Bolt battery fires absolutely floored me. One of the core assumptions of GM's electrification program was the superior safety and manufacturability of pouch-style, lithium-ion cells, as opposed cylindrical cells or those with other form factors.</p><p>For example: The way in which these cells—looking a bit like Pop-Tarts' foil bags—gang together in racks, then packs, requires fewer connections than cylindrical cells. Better, safer. The flat shape also offers more surface area for battery cooling; and preventing thermal runaway—ignition—is the most important thing. Just ask GM's in-house counsel.</p><p>In this way, safety would have seemed to play a determinative role in GM's use of such cells, even though they offer somewhat lower energy density compared to Tesla-typical cylindrical cells.</p><p>After this abundance of strategic caution, the LG Chem failure seemed unfair to GM and potentially misleading to consumers regarding the safety of EVs generally, since this technology is ubiquitous. Anyway, I'm confident the new Bolt, with battery 2.0, is super-duper safe.</p><p>When Bolt production resumed it included the model variant seen here, the EUV, which stands for \"electric utility vehicle.\" Here's where I could use an \"eye roll\" emoji. While the EUV's wheelbase is 2.9 inches longer and overall length stretched 6.3 inches, those inches don't meaningfully add to the interior utility. I'm not sure what they do, frankly.</p><p>Behind that molded-plastic face mask, the EUV is largely identical to the Bolt EV, itself emerged from a mid-cycle refresh with lots of desirable upgrades. Window-peepers have seen the overhauled and updated cabin focused on the easy and effortless touch screen UX, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Yes on wireless charging, yes on availability of GM's advanced driver-assistance system, called Super Cruise.</p><p>According to owners of first-Gen models, the new driver's seat is much more comfortable. I have to take their word for it; my butt's memory ain't what it used to be.</p><p>Under the hood is a 150 kW/360 Nm (200hp/266 lb-ft) permanent-magnet motor, offering plenty of swoosh as well as progressive levels of regenerative braking—a little or a lot, up to one-pedal control—activated via paddles on the backside of the steering wheel. There's also a dedicated switch in the center console to activate one-pedal mode. Bolts remain front-drive only, with no AWD option.</p><p>If, from a dead stop, you stand on the Go pedal, the EUV can scoot to 60 mph between 7-8 seconds, thereabouts and depending. The torque across the front axle can easily exceed the grip of the low-rolling-resistance tires, which makes it a bit of a squealer.</p><p>Even so, the Bolt EUV feels game and nimble, cheap and cheerful, with easy handling and a minimum of body roll while cornering, owing to the low-slung center of mass. Ride quality is good; interior noise level is just OK. It doesn't seem like much of the 3,679-pound curb weight was devoted to soundproofing materials.</p><p>In some ways, the Bolt is legacy-EV already. Back home in Detroit, all the sexy talk is about GM's Ultium platform, 320-mile Blazer EV crossovers and a Cadillac EV super sedan that will reportedly cost 300,000.</p><p>And yet this workaday EV everycar—with a brand name up there with Ford Pinto in the category \"famously flammable\"—seems to have acquired an unexpected, exquisite relevance, even desirability, despite its limitations as a sex machine.</p><p>The range is what it is—figure 200 miles between charges, just to be safe. A full charge at home (240 V) takes 7 hours, so overnight. GM has defended the Bolt's smallish 65-kWh battery as an optimization of cost vs. utility: Why should consumers pay for longer range when research shows they will never use it? Of course, that rationale depends on home charging, which in the past has been left to consumers to arrange.</p><p>No more. Get this: With every Bolt purchased, the company will provide free standard-type Level 2 charging equipment and home installation, where available.</p><p>GM, I could kiss you.</p><p>2022 Chevy Bolt EUV</p><p>Starting price: $38,995</p><p>Price, as tested: $43,190</p><p>Powertrain: all-electric, direct-drive single front permanent-magnet motor with 7.05:1 final drive ratio; 65-kWh lithium-ion battery pack.</p><p>Power/torque: 150 kW (200 hp), 360 Nm (266 lb-ft)</p><p>Length/wheelbase/width/height: 169.5/105.3/69.7/63.6 inches</p><p>0-60 mph: 7 seconds</p><p>Curb weight: 3,679 pounds</p><p>Charging time: approx. 7 hours (240 V, to 100%); 95 miles in 30 minutes (DC fast charge)</p><p>EPA estimated range: 248 miles</p><p>Cargo capacity: 16.3/56.9 cubic feet (rear seat backs up/folded)</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Join the conversation below.</p><p>Can the New Chevy Bolt EUV Win Back America's Trust?</p>",
