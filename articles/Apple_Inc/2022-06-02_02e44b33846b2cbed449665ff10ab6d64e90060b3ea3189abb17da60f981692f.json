  "text": "<p>(Avid Reader, 239 pages, $30)</p><p>In the late 1990s, as home-computer ownership and internet access expanded, investors developed an \"irrational exuberance\" about dotcom companies, driving unheard of (and unsustainable) gains in the Nasdaq. While this environment prompted some talented young people to start internet-related businesses or join venture-capital firms, Adam Seessel decided to take a job as an oil-and-gas investment analyst. Mr. Seessel was a value investor, focused on old-economy firms trading at low valuations. When the tech bubble burst, his career took off. He started his own firm in 2003.</p><p>In the mid-2010s, Mr. Seessel writes in his book \"Where the Money Is: Value Investing in the Digital Age,\" his funds experienced a \"wretched period of underperformance.\" His style of value investing didn't seem to be working, and he watched with frustration as the value of technology stocks soared. The author decided that he needed to either change his approach or \"consign myself and my clients to a future of dismal performance.\" Mr. Seessel -- a religious-studies major at Dartmouth -- describes what came next as a conversion. He bought shares in Google, then Amazon, then Intuit, and so on until his portfolio was full of tech stocks.</p><p>Mr. Seessel changed his tune \"unwillingly, with the same reluctance that a true believer gives up his faith. . . . I did it for the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks: it's where the money is.\" Technology certainly was where the money was during the 2010s. By the author's calculations, roughly half of U.S. market gains since 2011, and around two-thirds of market gains since 2016, came from information technology and related sectors.</p><p>If Value 1.0 is Benjamin Graham's style of recycling cheap stocks as they appreciate, and Value 2.0 is Warren Buffett's focus on business quality rather than price alone, Mr. Seessel calls his own approach Value 3.0, a systematic framework for investing that focuses on business quality, management ability and price. \"It just so happened,\" he writes, \"that when I overlaid this template on companies I was studying in the early twenty-first century, 90% that fit the framework turned out to be tech.\"</p><p>Mr. Seessel discusses what he looks for in management, namely, CEOs who think and act like owners and understand what drives profits. What really distinguishes his approach from traditional strategies comes down to accounting. Tech stocks require a different analytical framework because their financial statements look different from old-economy stocks. Tech companies tend to have little in the way of assets. Instead, they spend large amounts of money on research, development and new customer acquisition. This makes tech stocks look expensive when measured by traditional metrics like price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios.</p><p>Properly valuing tech companies, Value 3.0 holds, requires adjusting your view to discern what Mr. Seessel calls earnings power, \"a digital company's latent, underlying ability to generate profits.\" Jeff Bezos is the patron saint of this line of thinking. As the author points out, Amazon's valuation has averaged 10 times higher than the market, but it has also outperformed the market by a factor of 300. This is because Mr. Bezos spends all of the profits generated by his company on growth, either in new research and development or in new customer acquisition. These investments have paid off handsomely. Mr. Seessel argues that Amazon's earnings power is seven times reported e-commerce profits, making the company a \"table-pounding buy.\"</p><p>Though the author considers his approach a form of value investing, he also acknowledges the incompatibility of his new way of thinking with the old orthodoxies. \"Either the market is wrong and we're in for another tech wreck, or many of the traditional yardsticks for measuring value are broken,\" he writes. Mr. Seessel believes, of course, in the latter interpretation; the pessimists, he argues, are wrong to suggest that we're in for another bust.</p><p>This makes the timing of the book's publication quite interesting. Since its peak on Nov. 19, 2021, through the end of May, the Nasdaq is down 24%. Mr. Seessel cites Amazon, Google, Intuit and Apple as case studies of his approach, but since Nov. 19 these stocks are down 35%, 24%, 40% and 7%, respectively. Tech stocks suddenly don't seem like the surefire bet that they very recently were.</p><p>Writing a book about investing is brave: Markets can change fast and booms can rapidly turn to busts. The theologian Christopher Stead criticized St. Augustine for his tendency to \"read off lessons from his own experience and erect them into principles equally applicable to all mankind.\" Perhaps a better title for \"Where the Money Is\" would have been \"Where the Money Was From 2011-2021.\" Markets go through cycles, and recent experience is often a poor guide to the near future.</p><p>Mr. Seessel, who worked as a journalist before embarking on an investment career, writes in clear, simple prose, and an adventurous streak permeates his narrative. In the spring of 2020, he decided to buy some Bitcoin, just to \"see how it feels.\" He made a handsome return but decided, despite the profits, that Bitcoin wasn't for him. But he remains more than willing to evolve with the markets. \"The world has changed, but it will change again,\" he writes. \"When it does, we'll require new frameworks to capture the altered dynamics.\"</p><p>Mr. Seessel seems unable to resist experimentation, and I bet he won't be content applying his Value 3.0 framework day in and day out for the next 10 years. And if he develops a new investment strategy and writes another book, I hope he gets a little bit luckier with the timing of its publication.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Rasmussen is the founding partner of the hedge fund Verdad Advisers.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
