  "text": "<p>Uncertainties have grown about the central bank's monetary-policy plans, but also around how President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion budget bill fight in Washington will shake out for Wall Street.</p><p>How are stock futures trading?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA climbed 248 points, or 0.7%, at 34,826.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX traded 35 points, or 0.8%, higher to reach 4,478.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP rose about 94 points, or 0.6%, to 15,132.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow industrials dropped 292.06 points, or 0.8%, to finish at 34,577.57, the S&amp;P 500 index fell 25.68 points, or 0.6%, to 4,443.05 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 67.82 points, or 0.5%, to 15,037.76.</p><p>Read: Stock-market traders brace for ‘quadruple witching'</p><p>And: The S&amp;P 500 fights to hold above a short-term line in the sand of bullish momentum</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>Stocks were trading near session highs Wednesday afternoon, despite expectations that a choppy market likely will be the new normal until next week's policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.</p><p>“It's very hard [for the market to rise]&#xa0;in advance of the FOMC meeting,” Kristina&#xa0;Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said in a Wednesday morning phone interview.</p><p>“These are stomach&#xa0;churning days and we think it's going to be very hard to gain any type of substantial positive&#xa0;momentum,” Hooper said. The Fed's FOMC gathering is Sept. 21-22.</p><p>September also tends historically to be a down month for the U.S. stock market and the Dow and S&amp;P 500 have lost ground for six of the last seven days, while the Nasdaq has posted five straight days of losses. For September, the Dow is off by more than 2% and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are down about 1.5%.</p><p>With the help of peak “everything,” including fiscal stimulus from Washington and corporations raking in record profit, the S&amp;P 500 already has powered about 19% higher this year, according to FactSet.</p><p>“I think most investors have been expecting a pretty decent market this year because of the reopening of the economy,” said Carin Pai, head of portfolio management, at Fiduciary Trust International, in a phone interview. “But to see almost a 20% return on the market so far this year, that probably has been better than what most people expected.”</p><p>Pai now thinks the scuffle in Washington over plans by the Biden administration's $3.5 trillion budget, which aim trillions' of dollars at bolstering American families and the nation's aging infrastructure, is a key focus for investors, namely in terms of how corporate taxes shake out.</p><p>House Democrats this week proposed bumping corporate taxes up to 26.5% from the current 21% rate to help fund Biden's budget, which would be less than the initial 28% level proposed.</p><p>“A lot of what originally was proposed has been dialed back to get through reconciliation,” Pai said, of Biden's ambitious plans to retool the U.S. economy.</p><p>Investors are also sensitive to the fallout from the COVID pandemic, which is threatening to slow global economic growth, as the delta variant has fueled surging cases in the U.S. and other countries.</p><p>Read:Shop early and expect to pay more: Supply chain issues could be a stumbling block to upbeat holiday shopping forecasts</p><p>Invesco's Hooper also said the Fed has done a fairly good job in communicating its intention to taper its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities and that Chairman Jerome Powell also has emphasized the decoupling of tapering from eventual interest rate increases.</p><p>“The Fed has done a good job messaging but we just don't have exact dates,” the Invesco strategist said, speculating that the beginning of tapering might come in October if not November.</p><p>In economic data, the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index surged 16 points to 34.3 in September, the regional Fed bank said Wednesday. Economists had expected a reading of 17.2, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal. The index stood at 18.3 in August. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions.</p><p>Separately, the import price index dropped 0.3% last month,&#xa0;the government said Wednesday, marking the first decline in 10 months. The drop was mostly attributed to the lower cost of foreign oil and industrial supplies.</p><p>And data on U.S. industrial production showed a 0.4% rise in August after a 0.8% gain in the prior month, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday. The gain is below economist expectations of a 0.5%, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Microsoft Corp.MSFT rose 1.5% in Wednesday trade. The technology giant late Tuesday lifted its quarterly dividend by 11% and the company's board agreed a new stock buyback plan of up to $60 billion.</p><p>Shares of Las Vegas SandsLVS were down 3.2% and those for Wynn ResortsWYNN skidded 8%, while MGM ResortsMGM shares declined 3.3%. The losses came after casino shares slumped in Macau on indications the local government aims to more closely supervise those companies.</p><p>Kansas City SouthernKSUformally picksCanadian PacificCP over Canadian NationalCNI.
