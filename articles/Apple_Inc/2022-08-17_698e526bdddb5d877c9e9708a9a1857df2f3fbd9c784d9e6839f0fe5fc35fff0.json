Last quarter, Apple reported $40.67 billion in revenue from iPhone sales, up from $39.57 billion a year prior, and roughly half of the company's total revenue. That beat analysts' expectations, defying global supply-chain problems and rising inflation.</p><p>The iPhone 14 will reportedly feature a better camera but otherwise fairly minor technological upgrades, and will add a version with a 6.7-inch screen while eliminating the 5.4-inch \"mini\" version.</p><p>Analysts are bullish on Apple's outlook. Credit Suisse's Shannon Cross on Wednesday named Apple of of her \"top picks,\" raising her rating on the stock to outperform from neutral, with a $201 price target, while Wedbush's Dan Ives told CNBC that demand for Apple products will likely remain strong next year.</p><p>Apple shares AAPL closed slightly higher Wednesday, at $174.55, and are down about 2% year to date, following a 24% rally over the past three months. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 SPX is down 10% in 2022, after a 9% gain over the past three months.</p><p>Apple plans to unveil iPhone 14 at Sept. 7 event: report</p>",
