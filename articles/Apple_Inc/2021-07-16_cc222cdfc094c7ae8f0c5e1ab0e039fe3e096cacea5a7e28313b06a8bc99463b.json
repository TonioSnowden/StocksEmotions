  "text": "<p>   The European Union's top antitrust regulator foresees greater alignment with the U.S. on competition enforcement, particularly in the tech sector, amid a broader policy reorientation under the Biden administration. </p><p>   EU Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition commissioner, said she expects \"much more intense work when it comes to technology and the digitized market\" between her team and Washington. </p><p>   President Biden's policy statements and appointments, plus legislative proposals from Congress, indicate the U.S. is moving closer to positions long held in the EU regarding internet giants, pharmaceutical firms and other industries with diminishing competition. </p><p>   As the world's two most powerful antitrust regulators, the U.S. and the EU can shape global competition discourse and rein in many of the world's largest companies, so greater cooperation could have significant impact. </p><p>   For supporters of aggressive enforcement, \"it will certainly be a marriage made in heaven,\" said Jeffrey Jacobovitz, a Washington-based antitrust lawyer with Arnall Golden Gregory LLP. \"I think they'll work hand in hand. Increased coordination makes enforcement stronger.\" </p><p>   That alignment will make it even more incumbent on companies in the crosshairs to develop broad, cross-Atlantic strategies on how to respond to that scrutiny, he said. </p><p>   While tech companies said similar policies in multiple jurisdictions can simplify operations, some worry about the U.S. adopting some of Europe's more aggressive positions. </p><p>   \"The U.S. should be wary of copying EU-style experimental regulation,\" said Christian Borggreen, vice president and head of the Brussels office at the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, which represents companies including Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google. \"As a leader in tech innovation, the U.S. would have much more to lose if they get it wrong.\" </p><p>   Mr. Biden's appointments of high-profile U.S. progressives who have criticized tech giants -- Lina Khan to run the Federal Trade Commission, and Tim Wu to the White House Economic Council -- have been widely seen as indicating that Mr. Biden, a Democrat, plans to turn up the heat on internet conglomerates. </p><p>   Companies such as Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. previously felt little pressure from Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, who criticized past EU efforts to restrain U.S. tech companies. </p><p>   Ms. Vestager held an initial meeting with Ms. Khan by videoconference on July 2. Mr. Biden has yet to appoint someone to lead antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department. That nomination could provide further clues to his administration's approach. </p><p></p>",
