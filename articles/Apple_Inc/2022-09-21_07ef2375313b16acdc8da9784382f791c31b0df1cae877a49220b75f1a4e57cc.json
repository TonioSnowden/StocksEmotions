  "title": "Jeffrey Gundlach says bonds are 'wickedly cheap' compared to stocks — and offers one way to get a 9% return without much risk; Critical information for the U.S. trading day",
  "text": "<p>Gundlach says there's a serious risk the Fed will overtighten, and overshoot on the downside just as it overshot on the upside, particularly as it's also reducing the size of its balance sheet through quantitative tightening. \"Since they're trying to get [inflation] down 700 basis points, the overshoot may be even bigger,\" he says. \"Maybe it moves down to negative 4% on CPI, or negative 2%.\"</p><p>He says that's what the bond market is saying with inflation running at between 8% and 9%. \"Why is anyone buying a 3.50%-ish 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y? The only logic that squares the circle is that inflation will overshoot to the downside.\"</p><p>Gundlach says the S&amp;P 500 SPX will fall to as low as 3,000, and maybe \"3,400 — either way, lower than where it is today.\" And, perhaps not surprising from the man known as the bond king, he sees tons of opportunities in the fixed income space. \"Bonds are wickedly cheap to stocks,\" he said. \"And this is from somebody who said in January, stock markets are way overvalued, but was cheap to bonds. Not anymore.\"</p><p>\"This is a very good time to buy bonds, and one of the ways I know that, is nobody wants to do it,\" he said.</p><p>For investors with low risk tolerance, he said a bank loan fund made sense. He said the spread to short-term interest rates is about 300 basis points. So if the Fed takes rates to 4%, the investor gets a yield of 7%, but can buy the bonds below 95, with a default rate of less than 1%.</p><p>\"The way it goes wrong is if the Fed collapses interest rates down to zero again, and then you're going to have a lower income stream, but for the time being, it's a very easy way of getting income,\" said Gundlach.</p><p>The market</p><p>U.S. stock futures ES00 NQ00 edged higher before the Fed decision.
