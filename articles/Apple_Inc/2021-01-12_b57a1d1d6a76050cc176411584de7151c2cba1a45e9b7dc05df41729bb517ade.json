  "title": "U.S. News: Congress Gets Fuel to Rein In Big Tech Firms --- After social media sparked Capitol attack, stripping back liability shield is on the table",
  "text": "<p>\"The bottom line is that the odds of legislative action on privacy, antitrust and 230 just went up significantly,\" said Blair Levin, a policy analyst with equity research firm New Street Research. \"The party that wants to legislate now has the power to put a bill on the Senate floor, and on all those issues there are Republicans likely to join with Democrats.\"</p><p>Republicans have their own issues with big internet companies, asserting that they are abusing their power to silence conservative voices on their platforms. Many Republicans support rewriting Section 230, and some claim that tech companies are shifting further left to appease Democrats expanding their power in Washington.</p><p>After the Capitol riot, Twitter Inc. permanently banned Mr. Trump and Facebook Inc. indefinitely suspended him, citing his role in fanning violence, while Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google cut off support for the Parler social-media app on grounds that it doesn't adequately police content that could incite violence.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman pointed to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's post on Thursday explaining why Facebook acted to indefinitely block Mr. Trump. \"The current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,\" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.</p><p>A Twitter spokesperson said that the company's policies \"are enforced equally and impartially for everyone on the service and never on the basis of political ideology.\"</p><p>Amazon and Apple declined to comment on any possible political motives behind their actions. Google, which has previously denied political bias, also declined to comment.</p><p>Some experts expressed doubt that tech companies' recent actions would placate Democrats -- if that was the aim -- given the level of anger in Congress.</p><p>\"I don't think it's ultimately going to satisfy folks,\" given widespread calls for more accountability for big internet companies, said Emma Llanso, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a think tank.</p><p>Big tech is under fire on several fronts, but one of the biggest threats to its power are efforts to reconsider Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 law that gives internet companies sweeping immunity for hosting as well as moderating users' posts.</p><p>Tech companies consider that immunity fundamental to running their platforms, but prominent members of both parties have called for it to be revoked, including Mr. Trump and Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. That hasn't happened, in part because of dire predictions by the internet companies as well as many legal experts about the impacts on the internet ecosystem.</p><p>But the events of recent days have begun pushing lawmakers in both parties to consider more-drastic steps.</p><p>\"We . . . have to be very concerned about the use of social-media platforms to disseminate false information that invokes and incites violence,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.) said on Fox News on Sunday. \"These platforms have to do a much better job of preventing people from using their platforms to organize and execute violence and other harms.\"</p><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called for the repeal of Section 230 on Friday after Twitter's action against Mr. Trump. He had previously proposed more-modest changes.</p><p>\"Big Tech are the only companies in America that virtually have absolute immunity from being sued for their actions, and it's only because Congress gave them that protection,\" he wrote on Twitter.</p><p>After Twitter banned Mr. Trump Friday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who has previously joined with Republicans to propose some Section 230 changes, said that it \"took blood and glass in the halls of Congress -- and a change in the political winds -- for the most powerful tech companies in the world to recognize, at the last possible moment, the profound threat of Donald Trump.\"</p><p>Antitrust action represents another danger to large technology companies, especially Facebook and Google, which are already the targets of federal antitrust lawsuits that the Biden administration is expected to continue.</p><p>Privacy legislation could also advance this year. Members of Congress spent much of 2019 unsuccessfully trying to reach a deal on a bill that would give consumers more control over the information internet companies collect about them. They put those talks on ice in 2020 but say they will resume them this year.</p>",
