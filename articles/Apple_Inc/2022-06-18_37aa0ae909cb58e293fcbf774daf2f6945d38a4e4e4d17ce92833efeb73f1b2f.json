  "title": "Life Is More Pun With Dad Jokes; There's still a place for unabashedly lame parental humor. At least until the kids start rolling their eyes.",
  "text": "<p>I am the sole headliner at Club Dad, and forgive me for bragging: My sets do pretty well. My dad jokes might not be original, but they mostly kill. I've told the same corny jokes about animals for years (Why do bees have sticky hair? They use honeycombs. What do you call a fish with two knees? A tu-knee fish!) My two grade-schoolers, bless them, laugh like they're center row for Richard Pryor on the Sunset Strip.</p><p>On the way to soccer practice, I'll ridicule highway signs with groan-worthy comments (H ey, did that sign say STEEL PLATE IN HEAD?). I have told the famous Interrupting Cow knock-knock joke (Knock, knock. Who's there? Interrupting Cow. Interrupting Cow wh…MOOOOO!!!!) so many times, it's gotten to be, well…udderly ridiculous.</p><p>I know you're cringing right now, embarrassed for me. I don't care. I'm not expecting you, sophisticated adult reader, to find this humor funny. (You: I read your humor column regularly, pal. I already know you're not funny.) Dad jokes aren't designed to impress grown adults, especially grown adults seeking thoughtful information in a financial newspaper.</p><p>But dad jokes—and let's be clear, moms tell jokes with the best of 'em—get a bad rap. Yes, they are not edgy, or political or especially clever, and they're generally ineffective on anyone old enough to get a learner's permit. They rely too heavily on wordplay, puns and livestock—a disproportionate number of dad jokes, it seems, concern cows. They're almost always told with a whiff of enthusiastic desperation. Dad jokes are basically the cargo shorts of comedy.</p><p>And that's exactly what makes them great. Parents telling dad jokes aren't trying to win the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. They're seizing on the brief window in which their children are a captive audience of people who actually want to hang out with their parents. It's a fleeting, joyous period, and we're going for the laugh, 10 out of 10 times.</p><p>My proudest, a.k.a. lamest, dad joke \"talent\" might be rewriting Top 10 songs. Yes, I'm just like Weird Al Yankovic—except he's a genius, and I'm terrible. Do you want to hear my version of Taylor Swift's anthem \"Bad Blood,\" reimagined as \"Dad Bod?\"</p><p>'Cause baby, now I got Dad Bod</p><p>You know I used to have abs bod</p><p>So take a look what I've done</p><p>'Cause baby, now I got Dad bod (Hey!)</p><p>You're already sorry you read that, aren't you?</p><p>If I really want to bring down the house at Club Dad, all I have to do is land with a poop joke. I know: Potty humor is a low brand of humor, nothing to emulate, very inappropriate in the Journal, but let's be real. It really works. There's a reason poop jokes are poop jokes. They make children laugh, 300% of the time.</p><p>Generally, however, the best dad jokes are G-rated. Consider this one, which I got off my phone the other day. (You can ask Siri to tell you dad jokes, it turns out.)</p><p>Q: Where do they make average things?</p><p>A: The satisfactory.</p><p>This is the standard word-gag dad joke format. But there are other tacks. \"Many dad jokes operate on 'anti-humor,' or the deliberate denial of a clever punch line,\" the journalist Ashley Fetters wrote in the Atlantic magazine in 2018. She cites this joke: \"What did the farmer say when he lost his tractor? 'Where's my tractor?'\" </p><p>PHOTO: Joao Fazenda</p><p>No matter how successful, a dad joke is a declaration that a parent's days of being cool are over. My days of being cool never started—I have basically been a pair of cargo shorts in human form since I turned 12—but nothing evidences the passage into middle age more than an adult's re-appreciation of clunky humor.</p><p>Dad jokes, it turns out, are like naps: You really, really love them when you're 5, and then again when you're 45.</p><p>The father and NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo has taken to carrying around a book of collected dad jokes to try to build camaraderie and levity with the stone-faced basketball press.</p><p>Giannis: What do you call a cow on the floor?</p><p>Media: (nothing)</p><p>Giannis: (laughing) Ground beef!</p><p>My own father, a science teacher and a serious man, was not a big joke teller. The gap was made up by the father of a friend, an unrepentant dad joker who owned a lush sedan with a computerized voice that announced \"the door is ajar\" if a door wasn't properly closed.</p><p>\"The door is not ajar!\" this Dad would howl. \"The door is a door!\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your favorite dad joke? (Mothers, children and all parents are encouraged to submit!) Join the conversation below.</p><p>Another time, at a restaurant, when a waiter announced that night's sides included \"potatoes au gratin,\" the Sedan Dad bellowed: THE POTATOES ARE ROTTEN? (Decades later, I am still waiting to deploy the potatoes are rotten on my own children. I just need to find the right restaurant)</p><p>I know it's going to end. That's what all the experienced parents tell me is going to happen. There will come a time, in a few years, perhaps much sooner, when my jokes cease being funny to my children, and I will enter the wintry obsolescence that is otherwise known as Parent of a Teenager.</p><p>There are some parents who keep the dad jokes going as their kids become adolescents—who lean into their discomfort and actually seem to enjoy telling dad jokes more when it makes their kids embarrassed and furious, or worse, when they're around their friends. I am not sure I am mean enough to do this.</p><p>I can already see signs that Club Dad is waning. The kids are starting to laugh much more at TikToks and YouTube videos. My son has grown tired of my rendition of \"Dad Bod.\" I think I caught my daughter rolling her eyes at me the other day on the walk home from school.</p><p>That's OK. That's their right. However long they continue to appreciate my dad jokes, I'm going to try to enjoy it. Club Dad remains open for business. Children and cows are admitted free. But no baby cows. Don't you know? It's pasture bedtime.</p><p>Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com</p><p>Life Is More Pun With Dad Jokes</p>",
