  "text": "<p><strong>Barclays</strong> boss <strong>Jes Staley</strong> is stepping down in the wake of a regulatory investigation into his characterisation to the bank of his relationship with disgraced financier <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> “and the subsequent description of that relationship in Barclays' response to the FCA”. </p> <p>Barclays and Staley were told of the preliminary conclusions of the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority on Friday night. In a statement this morning the bank said that “in view of those conclusions, and Staley's intention to contest them”, Barclays and Staley had agreed he would step down as chief executive and as director of Barclays. </p> <p><strong>CS Venkatakrishnan</strong>, known as Venkat, will be Staley's successor. He takes over as Barclays CEO as of today. An ex-JP Morgan banker, he joined Barclays in 2016 as chief risk officer, rising to head of global markets last year. </p> <p>Barclays says it will pay Staley 12 months' notice — £2.4m in cash and shares and a £120,000 payment for his pension — and repatriation costs consistent with the terms of its directors' remuneration policy. Venkat will get £2.7m in fixed pay, half in cash an half in shares, plus £135,000 pension, a discretionary bonus of up to 93 per cent of salary and an award under the long term incentive plan of up to 140 per cent of salary. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Ryanair</strong> reported a loss of €48m for the first half of its financial year, roughly 90 per cent less than the same period last year. Customers in the six months to September more than doubled, while revenues increased 83 per cent and costs only 63 per cent. But the airline warned the outlook for this winter was challenging, with bookings being made late and requiring “continuing price stimulation”. The airline also said it was considering delisting from the LSE after the proportion of its shares traded on the exchange “reduced materially” during 2021. Its primary listing is in Dublin, while it also trades on Nasdaq.</p> <p>The audit watchdog has fined <strong>Grant Thornton</strong> more than £700,000 (£1.3m before adjustments) for its work on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f209dac-471f-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3\">collapsed outsourcer Interserve</a>. </p> <p><strong>Glencore</strong> has defended the pay for its chief executive after suffering a shareholder rebellion at its annual meeting earlier this year. Companies are required to report back to investors when more than 20 per cent vote against. Glencore has said it isn't changing its pay policy, because “no shareholder called for the current arrangements to be replaced”. Instead they asked for “transparent disclosure” of how the pay policy works in its first six months.</p> <p><strong>ProCook </strong>has published the price range for its IPO. It will be valued at between £150m and £200m. And <strong>Land Securities </strong>has announced a small deal, under which it will buy developer U+I for £190m, giving it access to a “significant pipeline of mixed-use development schemes”. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Snap, Facebook, Twitter</strong> and <strong>YouTube</strong> lost out on almost $10bn in revenues in the second half of this year after <strong>Apple</strong> changed iPhone privacy settings to ask users for permission before the apps tracked users' behaviour so they could serve them personalised ads. Most users opted out, so advertisers have switched their spending to Android phone users and Apple's own ad business, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c19e387-ee1a-41d8-8dd2-bc6c302ee58e\">Patrick McGee reports from San Francisco</a>.</p> <p><strong>Saudi Aramco</strong> reported its highest quarterly earnings since listing its shares in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37430da9-5069-462c-badc-7c742c13acbd\">Tom Wilson reports</a>. But the world's biggest oil exporter held its dividend at $18.8bn despite generating free cash flow of $28.7bn. </p> <p>And shares in <strong>Nomura </strong>fell almost 8 per cent on Monday, as markets reacted to an after-hours announcement that a surprise writedown had knocked the bank's profits down by 95 per cent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/057744d0-11ee-4b40-95c2-8a8db455a5ca\">William Langley reports from Hong Kong</a>. The company said on Friday night that the $345m charge was related to Nomura's US-based transactions prior to the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, but did not provide further details. The charge comes a quarter after the Japanese bank took a hit from exposure to Archegos Capital Management. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Lex editor <strong>Jonathan Guthrie</strong> explores <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7556f53f-bf3e-42cd-ab04-dac0097440f0\">the trend for “TradFi”</a> (aka City) firms investing in digital asset expertise off the back of the Bitcoin boom. To give you a taste, he says: “most regulated businesses are staffing up in areas that do not involve trading unregulated cryptos or giving investment advice. They resemble the nice kid who avoids inhaling when passed a joint at a party”.</p> <p>Do sign up for the excellent and always entertaining <strong>Lex Newsletter </strong><a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/subscribe?result=%7B%22successful%22%3A%5B%7B[…]657d10e4b04e04251004fd%22%7D%5D%2C%22unsuccessful%22%3A%5B%5D%7D\">here</a>, I highly recommend it.</p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Jes Staley leaves Barclays to fight Epstein probe findings' FT.com 1 November.
