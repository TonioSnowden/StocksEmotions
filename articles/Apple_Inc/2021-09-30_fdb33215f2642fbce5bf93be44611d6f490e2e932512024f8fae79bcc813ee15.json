  "title": "How does the Volvo XC40 Recharge compare to the VW ID.4?",
  "text": "<p>2022 Volkswagen ID.4</p><p>2022 Volkswagen ID.4 starting price:&#xa0;$41,190</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;250-mile range; optional all-wheel drive; 2,700-pound towing capacity; great standard safety features.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;Heavy; no spare tire; no volume knob for the stereo.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;A brand-new electric compact SUV, the Volkswagen ID.4 is a comfortable and practical vehicle boasting a 250-mile range. The weight keeps it from being the sportiest member of the segment, but the interior is quiet and comfortable.</p><p>2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge</p><p>Volvo2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge starting price:&#xa0;$55,085</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;Excellent safety features; distinct looks; standard all-wheel drive; luxurious interior.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;Cargo space; complicated touchscreen; only average range; rear foot room.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;The smallest of Volvo's VLVLY crossovers, the subcompact 2022 XC40 Recharge is the EV variant of the company's compact SUV. With all-wheel drive and plenty of safety features, it's definitely a Volvo, but it still has a few kinks to work out.</p><p>ID.4 vs. XC40 Recharge: Range or power</p><p>Volkswagen ID.4</p><p>As with a number of its competitors, Volkswagen is gambling big on an EV future, and the 2022 ID.4 is the first of the company's EVs to come to the U.S. The base model is rear-wheel drive, with a rear-mounted electric motor making 201 horsepower and giving the ID.4 250 miles of range. An all-wheel-drive variant has motors in both axles and makes 295 hp, but the range is reduced to 230 miles.</p><p>Acceleration is smooth rather than sprightly, perhaps owing to the ID.4's considerable weight, although Sport mode offers a bit more punch. Mostly this SUV is focused on comfort, with a very quiet cabin that's well insulated from the outside and a smooth ride. Properly equipped, the ID.4 can tow up to 2,700 pounds.</p><p>Inside, the interior is minimalist but spacious, with ample room for four or five in a pinch. Behind the second row is a usable 33 cubic feet of space that expands to 64 with the rear bench folded. Unlike many of its EV competitors, however, the ID.4 does not have space in what would normally be the engine compartment in front.</p><p>Standard features include heated seats, rain-sensing wipers, wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto, and 10-inch touchscreen. Also included are several driver-assist and safety features, including forward-collision warning, adaptive cruise control, and rear cross-traffic alert, among others.</p><p>Not only does the ID.4 qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit, but ID.4 owners get three years of unlimited charging at Electrify America fast chargers, which can bring the battery to 80% in about 40 minutes.</p><p>See: House Democrats plan EV tax credits of up to $12,500, as Republicans, Tesla, Toyota voice objections</p><p>XC40 Recharge</p><p>While the Volvo XC40 compact SUV has been around since 2019, 2022 marks the second year of the Recharge. This electric powertrain employs motors in both front and rear for standard all-wheel drive. The range is 208 miles, and the XC40 Recharge can be brought up to 80 percent in about 40 minutes using a fast charger.</p><p>Given its size and short wheelbase, the XC40 is quite maneuverable, with an impressive 402 horsepower and 486 pound-feet of torque. It's not only quick but sporty and confident when the road starts to curve. Ground clearance of 8.3 inches makes it a decent all-weather performer as well. Towing capacity maxes out at 2,000 pounds.</p><p>Inside, the XC40 Recharge is relatively roomy considering its compact footprint, offering a variety of options for storage space. The load area behind the rear seat is only 14.6 cubic feet, but it expands to 57.5 cubic feet with the back seat folded.</p><p>Standard features include heated front seats, satellite radio, dual-zone climate control, power moonroof, 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, and 9-inch vertical touchscreen with satellite radio, Google GOOGL Maps, and Google Play. It's also compatible with Apple CarPlay. Standard safety features include blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, driver alertness monitor, lane-keeping assist, and lane-departure warning.</p><p>Read: Chip shortage means vehicle inventory likely won't recover until 2023</p><p>Options include both a 360-degree camera system and a Harman Kardon audio system upgrade.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Charging time; good standard safety features; both qualify for $7,500 federal tax credit.</p><p>2022 Volkswagen ID.4 advantages</p><p>Longer range; more cargo space; lower cost; towing capacity; higher MPGe.</p><p>2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge advantages</p><p>Quicker acceleration; sharper handling; considerably more power; standard all-wheel drive.</p><p>You might like:The 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV review: A smooth, quiet, comfy ride</p><p>Which one is right for me?</p><p>With 250 miles of range, the 2022 Volkswagen ID.4 provides a smooth ride and a very comfortable cabin. All-wheel drive is available for poor weather.</p><p>Making considerably more power, the 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge just passes the 200-mile range threshold. Still, it provides the thrills of electric acceleration and handling with the bonus of standard all-wheel drive.</p><p>Compare the specs:</p><p>2022 Volkswagen ID.4                  2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge  Popular Powertrains  Electric Motor         220 kW permanent magnet               150/150 kW Dual AC permanent magnet  Horsepower             201 hp                                402 hp  Torque                 229 lb-ft                             487 lb-ft  EPA Driving Range      250 miles                             208 miles  EPA Fuel Economy       97 combined/104 city/89 highway MPGe  78 combined/85 city/72 hwy MPGe  Level 2 Charging Time  7-10 hours                            8 hours  Battery pack           82 kWh Li-ion; 288 cells              78 kWh Li-ion  Also available         AWD  Specs  Warranty               4 years/50,000 miles                  3 years/36,000 miles  Battery warranty       8 years/100,000 miles                 8 years/100,000 miles  NHTSA Safety Rating    n/a                                   5 stars  Max Seating Capacity   5                                     5  Wheelbase              108.9 inches                          106.4 inches  Overall Length         180.5 inches                          174.2 inches  Width                  72.9 inches                           73.7 inches  Height                 64.4 inches                           65.3 inches  Turning Diameter       33.6 feet                             37.4 feet  Headroom, Front        41.1 inches                           39.0 inches  Headroom, Rear         38.4 inches                           39.1 inches  Legroom, Front         41.1 inches                           40.9 inches  Legroom, Rear          37.6 inches                           36.1 inches  Shoulder Room, Front   57.5 inches                           56.7 inches  Shoulder Room, Rear    55.9 inches                           56.3 inches  EPA Passenger Volume   99.9 cubic feet                       98.0 cubic feet  Cargo Volume           33.0/64.2 cubic feet                  14.6/47.4 cubic feet</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
