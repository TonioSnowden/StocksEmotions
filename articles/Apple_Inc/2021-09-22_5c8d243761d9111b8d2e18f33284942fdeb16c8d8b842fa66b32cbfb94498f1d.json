  "text": "<p>Google's purchase of the 1.3 million-square-foot waterfront property is the latest sign that fears of the office building's demise look overblown. Vacancy rates across the U.S. are well above pre-pandemic levels and office rents have declined. But in recent weeks there is evidence that cheaper space is luring back corporate tenants, which have been shrugging off delays in returning to the office because of the Delta variant and are planning for the years ahead.</p><p>In Manhattan, office asking rents are down to where they were in 2017, but August leasing activity for Midtown was more than double the previous month, according to real-estate firm Colliers. French bank Credit Agricole SA signed a new lease in Midtown, while swimwear maker Longevity Brands added space in the Garment District.</p><p>Newer office buildings, meanwhile, are finding buyers again after a stretch last year when these properties mostly repelled investors. Towers with tenants committed to long-term leases have sold at high prices, in part because low interest rates make them look like attractive investments in comparison. In March, private-equity firm KKR &amp; Co. paid $1.1 billion for a San Francisco office building leased to Dropbox Inc., the most expensive office sale in the city in more than a decade.</p><p>Google, Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and other tech giants have emerged in recent years as some of the biggest renters and buyers of office space throughout the U.S. Tech companies are taking advantage of lower office building prices and putting billions of dollars in cash reserves to use, real-estate investors said.</p><p>\"Even if they have 20% of their workforce working remotely, business is just growing so fast that the other 80% still needs a place to go,\" said Brian Kingston, chief executive of landlord Brookfield Property Partners.</p><p>Cities usually welcome the arrival of big tech companies for bringing an influx of well-paid employees and a boost to property-tax revenue, though these companies' presence has also fueled concerns over rising commercial and apartment rents.</p><p>Google has embraced remote work more aggressively than many large-company peers, letting employees work at home since the spring of 2020. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google parent Alphabet Inc., said last month that the company would delay its return to the office until January. But the Manhattan office purchase underscores how the company views office space as an important part of its long-term strategy.</p><p>Google, like many of the country's bigger employers, has said it envisions a hybrid workplace. Mr. Pichai told employees that most of them would end up spending around three days a week in the office and two days working remotely, according to a May email he wrote to employees that Google published.</p><p>\"We know that our employees, in order to really be happy and productive, need to collaborate,\" said William Floyd, Google's director of public policy and government affairs. \"Because of that need to collaborate, we've been investing more and more in office space.\"</p><p>Google is already leasing the building, a former freight terminal dubbed St. John's Terminal, in the Hudson Square neighborhood. The company has an option to buy, which it said it plans to exercise in the first quarter of 2022. The Manhattan building is currently under construction and expected to open in mid-2023.</p><p>Google often prefers to buy buildings because owning spaces makes changing them in the future easier, like reconfiguring floor plans. \"We like to control our own space,\" Mr. Floyd said.</p><p>The sellers are two Canadian companies: real-estate firm Oxford Properties Group, which joined with Related Cos. on Manhattan's Hudson Yards commercial and residential development, and CPP Investments, a pension fund manager.</p><p>Google has been expanding its New York offices in recent years and now employs around 12,000 people in the city -- its biggest workforce outside California. That number is up from around 7,000 in 2018, Mr. Floyd said. The company's offices, some owned and some leased, are clustered in Manhattan's Chelsea and Hudson Square neighborhoods.</p><p>The acquisition of St. John's Terminal cements Google's status as one of Manhattan's biggest commercial property owners. The company paid $2.4 billion for the nearby Chelsea Market building in 2018 and owns 111 Eighth Ave. and the Milk Building at 450 W. 15th St. Globally, Alphabet held $55.9 billion worth of land and buildings as of June 30, according to its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Tech companies have said they favor New York over cheaper cities because of its large skilled labor pool and appeal to many young professionals. Amazon.com once planned to open a second headquarters in the city but backed out of the plans in 2019 after the subsidies it would receive drew opposition from local lawmakers. Google's latest deal shows that the Amazon episode has done little to dent New York's appeal to tech companies.</p><p>\"New York City is the place for world-class talent and Google's acquisition of 550 Washington Street in Manhattan for its workforce demonstrates that,\" said Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, a Democrat.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
