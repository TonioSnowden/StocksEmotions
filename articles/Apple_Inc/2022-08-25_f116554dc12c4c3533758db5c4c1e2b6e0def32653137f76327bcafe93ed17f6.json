  "title": "Labor Activists Get Fashionable—to the Chagrin of Old-Line Unionists; The head of the new Amazon union, for one, is a sartorial standout. Veterans are happy with their jeans and steel-toed boots.",
  "text": "<p>Chris Smalls, the activist who led the organizing drive at Amazon, wore a red baseball cap, red sweats and hoodie and a red \"Amazon Labor Union\" shirt on top that day, all finished with a pair of oversize sunglasses. Pictures of his outfit went viral.</p><p>At the Time 100 gala two months later, Mr. Smalls went with black overalls and a black blazer, along with a bandanna and huge black shades. For an appearance on \"The Daily Show,\" he donned a bubble gum-pink Amazon Labor Union shirt and a printed baby blue bomber jacket.</p><p>Mr. Elward, whose grandfather once headed a local branch of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, had already noticed more style creeping into labor activism. He launched the Twitter account \"Dripped Out Trade Unionists\"—using hip-hop slang for ultrafashionable—to chronicle the sartorial leanings of retail employees, machine operators, engineers and other workers.</p><p>He now has about 30,000 followers and regularly gets messages from workers sending him snapshots of their outfits or asking things such as, \"Where can I get that jacket?\"</p><p>Some others, though, would be happy to see things stay on the plainer side. Matt Lelou, a factory worker and president of a Communications Workers of America local in Minnesota, is strictly back to basics—jeans and work boots—when he takes part in union activities.</p><p>\"I'm not the guy into fashion,\" he said. \"I'm just focused on the nuts and bolts.\"</p><p>Mr. Lelou, 46, cautions workers publicly protesting pay and working conditions not to get too snazzy. \"If you're wearing $400 shoes,\" he said, \"that could shoot some of your arguments in the foot.\"</p><p>Style doesn't usually spring to mind as an element of the modern American labor movement. Striking factory or mine workers are often pictured in flannels or work clothes.</p><p>But the pandemic put essential workers, including nurses and delivery drivers, in the public eye—and along the way made their gear trendy. Also, young people who generally have a sense of style have often led the union movements of the last two years.</p><p>In England, several fashion brands launched shirts inspired by the National Health Service. Late last year, the U.S. Postal Service teamed up with shoe company Vans on a footwear and apparel collection. It featured an iteration of Vans' popular Sk8-Hi shoes decorated with the postal service's eagle logo. There was also a Vans/USPS-themed pocket T-shirt and beanie.</p><p>Sarina Daniels, a 28-year-old in Fort Collins, Colo., who describes herself as a fan of the postal service, bought both the high-top and low-top variations of the shoe. \"My carriers have always been great, and as a suburban kid, we knew our mailman, and mail was sort of a staple of my childhood,\" said Ms. Daniels, who works as a bookseller.</p><p>She was so high on the postal-theme sneakers that she tried to get a pair for her local mail carrier, but they sold out before she could.</p><p>Some street-style casual wear now incorporates labor-union T-shirts, worn along with bucket hats, studded-out baseball caps or varsity jackets. In May, Mr. Elward tweeted a photo of actress Susan Sarandon in a Teamsters union bomber jacket.</p><p>\"Love my @Teamsters jackets,\" she responded.</p><p>Bob Reiter, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor, which has about 300 affiliated unions, has been trying to modernize that organization's merchandise to keep up.</p><p>\"We have asked, 'How do we sell stuff to get the message out, but that our activists want to wear?' \" he said. Mr. Reiter, 48, studies the merchandise tables at music concerts for inspiration. \"A lot of those styles are where the cutting edge is,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Reiter recently led a website update to offer goods in line with the latest fashions. It includes trucker hats, a black shirt with \"#union\" on it and, soon, bomber jackets emblazoned with the union's initials.</p><p>Angelika Maldonado, a 28-year-old organizer with the Amazon Labor Union, sometimes wears all-black outfits, including a black ALU shirt and black Nike Air Max shoes. Other days, it's a pink ALU shirt and biker shorts.</p><p>At a Baltimore-area Apple Inc. retail store that in June became the first to unionize, workers have started a \"Crocs Sunday\" tradition, said employee Julian Milligan. The colorful clogs are back in vogue.</p><p>As their organizing effort took off, some employees began to integrate their union shirts with their wardrobes. \"Everyone in the store is pretty fashionable,\" said Mr. Milligan, 24, who said he has more than 10 variations of Crocs. \"I try to have a different pair of Crocs each Sunday.\"</p><p>The fashion fuss is lost on Lewis Overlock, a Laborers' International Union of North America officer and former construction worker in Maine.</p><p>\"I don't need a walk-in closet,\" said Mr. Overlock, 47. To hold his clothes, \"if you just give me a barrel, I'm all set.\"</p><p>As a former member of the U.S. Marine Corps, Mr. Overlock is used to a pared-down look.</p><p>\"Clothing is more of a necessity and a need in my world,\" he said. \"When I think of shoes, I think of steel-toed boots.\"</p><p>Write to Sebastian Herrera at Sebastian.Herrera@wsj.com</p><p>Labor Activists Get Fashionable—to the Chagrin of Old-Line Unionists</p>",
