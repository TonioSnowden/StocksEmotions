  "text": "<p>Streaming companies cannot stop spending their money on live sports. Amazon paid $1bn to be the exclusive provider of “Thursday Night Football”. Apple signed a 10-year deal with Major League Soccer. Now YouTube has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44953d73-cc46-4bea-bcb3-65661643c5fe\">agreed to pay about $2bn</a> per year for exclusive rights to certain National Football League Sunday afternoon games.</p> <p>Perhaps Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai is an American football fan? This is an expensive way for YouTube's parent company to buy an audience. YouTubeTV costs $64.99 per month. If it charges a $25 add-on for NFL games, it will need 1.85mn subscribers to break even. That means increasing its subscriber base by around a third. It will hope to pick up subscribers from former NFL Sunday Ticket rights holder DirecTV. </p> <p>There is a reason Apple and Amazon do not separate out profits and losses from their own streaming services. Alphabet reports only YouTube's advertising revenue (which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d61bc4bb-2748-4e4d-939e-b93ac3b15980\">down </a>on last year). Subscriptions for YouTube Premium and YouTube TV are included in “other” — a huge category that also includes in-app purchases and sales of Fitbits. </p> <p>Alphabet says the division's growth is led by YouTube. Given the increase was less than 2 per cent in the nine months ending September 30, this is not particularly impressive. </p> <p>Look at results published by rivals and the brutal impact of competition is clear. Disney's “direct to consumer” media and entertainment unit — aka streaming — reported an operating loss of $4bn on revenue of just under $20bn in the 12 months to October 2. Charging low monthly rates while buying pricey programmes is expensive. </p> <p>Alphabet has the funds to compete. The NFL deal is equal to about 3 per cent of free cash flow last year. Using sport to lock in long-term subscribers may mitigate the slump in US streaming audiences that Netflix reports. YouTube has a seven-year contract with the NFL. </p> <p>But sports broadcasting is not an automatic money-spinner. See BT's exit from the game. The scrummage of competitors will make it tough for YouTube to break through.</p><p>Source:  2022 'NFL/streaming: YouTube wants to be the only thing you watch' FT.com 23 December.
