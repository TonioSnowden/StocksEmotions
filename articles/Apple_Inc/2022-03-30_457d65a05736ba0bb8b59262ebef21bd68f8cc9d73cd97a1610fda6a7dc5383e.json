  "text": "<p>(HBO Max)</p><p>It took about 3,000 eggs and 1,000 pounds of butter to whip up the first season of \"Julia,\" HBO Max's new series about Julia Child's transition from a chef and cookbook author to the host of \"The French Chef\" and a pioneering TV personality. Every time a dish was cooked on the series, Sarah Lancashire, who portrays Ms. Child and who did her own cooking, had to cook it over and over for each take.</p><p>Daniel Goldfarb, the show's creator, says the goal wasn't to get the recipes just right for the camera. In fact, in the first episode, when Ms. Child throws together an omelet on a hot plate during a TV appearance, the omelet turns out runny. Mr. Goldfarb said they left in the runny omelet because they wanted to evoke Ms. Child's message that entertaining wasn't about perfection, but experience.</p><p>\"Don't get me wrong, the food is gorgeous on the show,\" he says. \"But, we also wanted to make sure that that was part of the story, that we didn't just erase the imperfections from Julia. The imperfections are part of what makes her so beautiful.\"</p><p>This approach contrasts with the pursuit of mess-free perfection that is seen on social media and many TV shows today.</p><p>\"So much of what we see in modern culture makes us feel bad about ourselves because people advertise only their best selves, and Julia advertised all of herself,\" says showrunner Chris Keyser. \"Watching Julia makes you think: Oh, I can do anything and it's OK if I'm not perfect at it.\"</p><p>The first three episodes of \"Julia\" begin streaming Thursday on HBO Max.</p><p>'The Outlaws'</p><p>(Prime Video)</p><p>\"The Outlaws\" starts as a comedy about a group of strangers who must complete court-mandated community service by sprucing up a dilapidated community center in Bristol, England. It becomes a thriller when one of them stashes a drug dealer's bag of cash in the building, and some of the others find it. Juggling both genres, \"The Outlaws\" explores social-media culture, criminal justice, found family and how a motley group of strangers has the perspectives, skills and life experiences to be there for each other.</p><p>The ensemble cast includes Eleanor Tomlinson as an influencer, Clare Perkins as a social-justice activist and Christopher Walken asa check-forging grandfather. \"The Outlaws\" was co-created by Stephen Merchant—co-creator of the British version of \"The Office,\" who also plays Greg, a nerdy and lonely lawyer—and Elgin James, an ex-gang member and co-creator of the FX crime drama \"Mayans M.C.\"</p><p>Mr. Merchant admits that the two are an unlikely pair. They wanted that reflected in the show. They also wanted to lean into the idea of political polarization to show what would happen if a group of strangers with different political positions and perspectives were literally forced to work together.</p><p>\"It could have humor and it could have some genre kind of crime thrills,\" Mr. Merchant says. \"But at the same time, it could have something at the core of it that felt like a little more of an observation of where we are socially.\"</p><p>All six episodes of the first season of \"The Outlaws\" begin streaming Friday on Prime Video.</p><p>'Servant'</p><p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>\"Servant\" is another thriller that gives audiences opportunities to laugh.</p><p>The series, which wrapped up its third season last week, is about a family who loses their baby, buys a therapy doll and hires a suspicious nanny to care for it. The show also includes a cult called The Church of the Lesser Saints and a ukulele performer named Mr. Smiley.</p><p>Showrunner M. Night Shyamalan—best known for movies such as \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Unbreakable\"—didn't feel comfortable co-mingling comedy and darkness early in his career, saying they felt like \"church and state.\" But when he made his 2015 movie, \"The Visit,\" he decided to go for it—and it worked.</p><p>\"I remember the first audiences I showed 'The Visit' to, they were like: I didn't know whether to be scared or laugh,\" Mr. Shyamalan said in an interview before the latest season began. \"And I was like: That's all good. You're meant to laugh. In fact, you're meant to do both.\"</p><p>Mr. Shyamalan says he committed to enlisting both in \"Servant,\" too.</p><p>\"I keep pushing the writers and the director to go for it,\" he says.</p><p>The first three seasons of \"Servant\" are streaming on Apple TV+.</p><p>'Moon Knight'</p><p>(Disney+)</p><p>\"Moon Knight,\" the latest Marvel series on Disney+, stars Oscar Isaac as a man with dissociative identity disorder whose personalities include a soft-spoken gift-shop clerk named Steven Grant and a mercenary named Marc Spector. He is also Moon Knight—the human embodiment of the Egyptian god Khonshu. His primary adversary is a cult leader named Arthur Harrow, played by Ethan Hawke, who lines his footwear in broken glass, worships the god Ammit and was Khonshu's previous human avatar. Moon Knight stands between Harrow and his plans to heal the world through mass murder.</p><p>Confused? Some critics are finding it all a bit unclear as well. Rolling Stone called the series \"kind of a mess.\" The Hollywood Reporter notes that \"Moon Knight barely factors into his own story\" and that \"few viewers unversed in the comic lore will be able to tell you after four episodes what he can or can't do.\"</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Hawke broke down the series' complicated premise.</p><p>\"It's about a hero that kind of takes the shape of the moon. He keeps changing. He doesn't even know his own personality. He doesn't even know if he actually is a superhero, or if he's insane,\" he says. His own character exists in a similar space; is he a supervillain or a doctor trying to help? \"We're really not sure 'til the end.\"</p><p>\"Moon Knight\" is streaming now on Disney+.</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>— More Julia: If you are craving more Julia Child, Pluto TV has a free streaming channel featuring Julia Child 24 hours a day. The \"Julia Child\" channel pulls episodes from shows such as \"The French Chef,\" \"Baking with Julia\" and \"Julia &amp; Jacques Cooking at Home.\"</p><p>— \"The Office\": The British version of \"The Office,\" which was co-created by Ricky Gervais and \"The Outlaws\" co-creator Stephen Merchant, is streaming on HBO Max.</p><p>What to Watch: 'Julia' and Four More Shows to Stream This Week</p>",
