  "text": "<p>(Disney+)</p><p>\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,\" a new one-hour animated film that begins streaming Friday on Disney+, is about Greg Heffley and his best friend, Rowley Jefferson, as they transition to middle school: the classes, the bullies, the lunchroom and, of course, the dreaded \"cheese touch.\" It is based on the first novel in Jeff Kinney's book series that has sold more than 250 million copies world-wide.</p><p>The book was previously adapted for the screen as part of the four live-action feature films released between 2010 and 2017. This time, the screenplay was written solely by Mr. Kinney. It is the first in an animated reboot of the franchise for Disney+. The next film, \"Rodrick Rules,\" is scheduled for 2022.</p><p>Mr. Kinney credits working on the live-action films with helping him improve his narrative chops. Writing the screenplays for the animated films himself, he says, has given him an opportunity to \"tell the stories in a better way than they're told on the page.\"</p><p>\"I started writing 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' when I was 28 years old and writing a good story was never an imperative to me. I was trying to write a funny story. I was trying to tell lots and lots of jokes,\" says Mr. Kinney, who added: \"Only now, at book 16, would I say I'm a capable novelist.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Harlem'</p><p>(Amazon Prime Video)</p><p>Tracy Oliver always enjoyed \"Sex and the City,\" but when she went to create \"Harlem,\" her own show about single women in New York who share the intimate details of their dating lives and careers with each other in real-time, she wanted it to reflect the unique experiences of Black women like herself.</p><p>Among the conundrums: If you are a Black woman who is interested in dating Black men, she says, the numbers game can \"get a little dire.\" If you are open to dating white men and someone who is interested in you on a dating app has dated Black women before, \"then you're like: wait, do you have a fetish or do you really like me and am I overthinking this?\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately? Join the conversation below.</p><p>But more important to her than the love lives of the four women at the center of \"Harlem,\" Ms. Oliver says, is the relationship they have with each other.</p><p>\"I'm really attracted to the relationships of friends and how we can kind of be real and honest in a way that other relationships aren't,\" says Ms. Oliver, who co-wrotethe hit feature \"Girls Trip,\" about a group of friends who attend a festival in New Orleans. \"I'm more attracted to that even than romantic stuff. It always comes back to friendship stuff for me.\"</p><p>\"Harlem\" begins streaming Friday on Prime Video.</p><p>New Release: 'The Beautiful Liar'</p><p>(Various)</p><p>When Sam Harris and his band, X Ambassadors, were making their most recent album, \"The Beautiful Liar,\" he says he felt a narrative structure developing around the songs. So Mr. Harris says he decided to turn them into something more than \"just a bunch of songs put together in a playlist.\" He ended up with a concept album that has elements of audiobooks, radio dramas and a podcast that turns the story on the album into a movie without pictures.</p><p>\"The Beautiful Liar,\" a scripted, narrative podcast starring Mr. Harris alongside Emily Hampshire of \"Schitt's Creek,\" is streaming now on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and other podcast providers. It is a superhero story about a blind teenager named Clementine (Rory Anne Dahl) who discovers that she has special powers and a voice inside her head known as \"The Shadow\" (Ms. Hampshire). She has to manage both while she also manages being a teenager.</p><p>Mr. Harris says the podcast medium was ideal for the project because it is accessible to all members of his band. Mr. Harris's brother and bandmate, Casey, is blind, and the pair grew up listening to audiobooks and radio dramas together.</p><p>\"I always try to do something that is personal and as a band, we always try to figure out like, OK: what is it about us who we are? What is something that we can put out into the world that is an identity marker?\" says Mr. Harris. \"And the books on tape and the world of radio dramas, it's always something that my brother and I shared.\"</p><p>STREAMING NOTES:</p><p>— Property Brothers: Jane Campion's new western, \"The Power of the Dog,\" stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons as Montana ranchers Phil and George Burbank—the latter of whom marries a widow (Kirsten Dunst) with a son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). \"The Power of the Dog\" is streaming now on Netflix.</p><p>— Showstoppers: The fourth season of \"The Great British Baking Show: Holidays\" premieres Friday on Netflix.
