  "text": "<p>Leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee offered their own proposal to discourage social-media companies from promoting harmful content.</p><p>\"There's a different sense of urgency now, coupled with a level of bipartisanship that is truly rare,\" said Tim Wu, special assistant to President Biden for technology and competition. \"This is, as they say, the moment.\"</p><p>Underlying much of the recent action were disclosures in The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series, including one that Facebook Inc.'s internal research showed that its Instagram app makes body-image worries worse for a substantial minority of teen girls. The disclosures prompted two Senate hearings and renewed calls for legislative remedies.</p><p>One of the measures with the best chance of passage is an update to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which has bipartisan support and is backed by children's advocacy groups.</p><p>\"If there's going to be anything, it's around kids,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of Fairplay, a nonprofit group formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, speaking to the prospects for tech legislation.</p><p>Mr. Golin and others want the law updated to bar internet companies from collecting personal information of 13- to 15-year-olds without the user's consent. They also want a digital marketing bill of rights for minors that limits the collection of personal information.</p><p>Action is by no means assured. Facebook and other major tech companies, including Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Apple Inc., all field extensive lobbying operations in Washington.</p><p>The big tech companies have said generally that they support updated regulation of the internet.</p><p>Facebook has been running ads on streaming services and TV urging new regulation, noting that the last time lawmakers passed comprehensive internet regulations was in 1996. \"Companies like Facebook have completely different challenges and responsibilities, and this is why Facebook supports updated internet regulations,\" the company said.</p><p>But the companies have also objected to many specific proposals in Congress. When it comes to modernization of antitrust laws, the companies and their supporters generally contend that they operate in dynamic markets and warn that congressional proposals could damage the online economy as well as U.S. competitiveness.</p><p>Mark Isakowitz, Google's vice president for government affairs and public policy, said the company is part of a \"fast-moving, rapidly changing, competitive industry\" and doesn't oppose antitrust scrutiny, or more regulation of privacy and online platforms serving children. When it comes to the new antitrust proposals, he added, \"Congress should carefully consider the unintended consequences for Americans and small businesses of breaking a range of popular products that people use every day.\"</p><p>There is also a record of inertia from Congress. A comprehensive federal privacy law, modernization of antitrust laws and a rethinking of tech companies' sweeping federal liability shield have remained unfinished since the political pendulum began to swing against the companies following the 2016 election. Five years into a public backlash against major internet platforms, lawmakers have passed only a handful of narrow changes.</p><p>\"It's frankly nothing short of pathetic,\" said Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), a longtime industry critic. In the current environment, he said, \"it would be a fairly damning commentary on Congress\" if lawmakers \"didn't put some points on the board.\"</p><p>Other lawmakers are seeking to use the moment to renew their pursuit of more ambitious goals. Last week leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee rolled out a new proposal to update the liability shield known as Section 230 that generally insulates internet platforms from liability for harms caused by users' posts on their sites.</p>",
