  "text": "<p>Hyatt, the US hotel group, has agreed to buy private equity-backed resorts operator Apple Leisure Group for $2.7bn, expanding its reach in the fast-recovering recreational travel market.</p> <p>Apple Leisure, owner of the Zoëtry and Sunscape resort brands, will allow Hyatt to increase vastly its share of the luxury resorts market, which has proved one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/610c93e0-bb27-419b-aaea-836ef16e3270\">most resilient</a> during the coronavirus pandemic as wealthy customers rush to book holidays after long periods of lockdown.</p> <p>Hyatt said it would fund the acquisition through $1bn cash and the remainder through a mixture of debt and equity financing. It will add $2bn worth of assets to an existing programme of hotel real estate sales in order to pay down the debt.</p> <p>The divestments come as the US hotel group seeks to generate 80 per cent of its revenues from management fees, as opposed to owning and leasing hotels, by 2024. </p> <p>The deal values Apple Leisure, an asset-light operator, at $2.7bn including debt.</p> <p>Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt's chief executive, said on Sunday that “right out of the block”, the deal would double the number of Hyatt resorts around the world. Apple Leisure has also completed a further 24 deals for new resorts and has 40 under negotiation.</p> <p>“The fact is that leisure travel is proven to be extremely durable and something that is going to be enduring in terms of demand and I think that the all-inclusive approach is very attractive to a lot of customers,” he said.</p> <p>The deal is the latest move by a big hotel chain to increase its footprint in the high-end leisure travel sector as groups try to cushion a longer-term fall in the number of business trips.</p> <p>InterContinental Hotel Group announced last week that it planned to launch <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e598586-8e1d-4426-bb1e-5b49cd3897c0\">a luxury resort brand</a> imminently, while Marriott, the world's largest hotel group, has also said it wants to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/beb71d58-41ce-11e9-b896-fe36ec32aece\">increase</a> its all-inclusive resort offering.</p> <p>Accor, the largest hotel group in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b32df546-c884-471e-b1a2-e0191dcde4b8\">spun off</a> its high-end leisure assets into a joint venture with the Hoxton hotel chain operator Ennismore last year.</p> <p>Amanda Hite, president of the hotel industry analytics company STR, said that the spread of the Delta variant was causing increased concern about the return of business travel: “It's possible that businesses wait until early 2022 to put their people back on the road.”</p> <p>Hyatt first invested in all-inclusive resorts when it launched a $325m venture with Playa Hotels and Resorts in 2013. Hoplamazian described the Apple Leisure deal as a continuation “of a strategy that we have remained extremely closely dedicated to for years”.</p> <p>He added that while rivals had entered the luxury leisure market, “they haven't expanded significantly yet” and Apple Leisure would give Hyatt a competitive advantage in the space.</p> <p>Apple Leisure, which is currently owned by the US private equity group KKR and the travel specialist KSL Capital Partners, operates about 100 all-inclusive luxury resorts as well as one of the largest tour operators for package holidays from the US to Mexico and the Caribbean. </p> <p>The acquisition will add approximately 28,500 employees to Hyatt, which was forced to lay off a quarter of its head office staff during the pandemic. It will also increase the US hotel group's European hotel portfolio by 60 per cent.</p> <p>Hoplamazian said the wealthier demographic of the Apple Leisure traveller was similar to Hyatt's, allowing Hyatt to take a greater portion of each customer's “total travel budget”. </p> <p>Chris Harrington and Rich Weissmann, partners at KKR and KSL, respectively, said: “There is simply no better home for ALG to continue on its growth trajectory than being part of Hyatt.” </p> <p>Apple Leisure's management team, led by chief executive Alejandro Reynal, will continue to run the company.</p><p>Source: Alice Hancock in London 2021 'Hyatt to buy resorts operator Apple Leisure Group for $2.7bn' FT.com 15 August.
