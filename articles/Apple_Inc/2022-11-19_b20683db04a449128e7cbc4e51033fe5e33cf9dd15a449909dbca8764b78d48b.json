  "text": "<p>   SINGAPORE -- China's central government has laid out preparations to deal with surging Covid-19 infections, while warning local authorities against \"irresponsible loosening\" of pandemic-control measures. </p><p>   China would continue to \"rectify the practice of excessive measures such as lockdowns, while also opposing irresponsible attitudes and prevent a loosening up,\" said Mi Feng, spokesman for China's National Health Commission on Thursday. </p><p>   China reported more than 24,000 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, according to data from the National Health Commission on Friday, edging closer to the high point seen during Shanghai's monthslong lockdown this year. Infections were recorded nationwide, with numbers rising in two-thirds of the provincial-level regions. </p><p>   Beijing reported more than 450 new cases, close to Monday's record and bringing total cases in the nation's capital to nearly 2,500 since the government unveiled measures aimed at easing the impact from stringent pandemic controls. On Friday, officials urged residents of Beijing's biggest district, Chaoyang, to stay home this weekend. </p><p>   Zhengzhou -- where Apple Inc. supplier Foxconn Technology Grouphas faced an outbreak at the world's biggest iPhone assembly plant -- found more than 1,600 new infections. About 4,700 new cases were detected in China's southwestern metropolis of Chongqing. </p><p>   Guangzhou, the provincial capital of China's manufacturing powerhouse Guangdong, had the highest tally, with more than 9,000 new cases among its 19 million residents. </p><p>   China's leadership issued a notice recently that instructed local governments to ease Covid controls, cut the length of quarantines and reduce unnecessary mass testing. But editorials in The People's Daily -- the Chinese Communist Party's flagship publication -- continued to call on China's population to stick with its approach of staying vigilant and nipping outbreaks in the bud. </p><p>   The mixed messaging has left local governments trying to figure out how to handle Covid cases without resorting to the most stringent rules of China's zero-tolerance approach. </p><p>   At Thursday's briefing, Beijing also unveiled plans for the hospital system to deal with a surge of new infections by building more facilities for treating severe Covid cases, and to ensure that intensive-care units account for 10% of all hospital beds. </p><p>   China has relaxed the categories of people who must be isolated in response to the loosening instructions, but it still requires every infected person and close contacts to enter quarantine. </p><p>   Guangzhou has announced plans to add beds for nearly a quarter of a million people to handle surging infections, including 132,015 in hospital isolation wards and 114,392 for people who are infected but have no symptoms. </p><p>   Sudden and sometimes prolonged closures of workplaces, schools and neighborhoods have been fueling frustration and protests across China this year. </p><p>   In one possible hint at future easing, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said on Friday that China is considering hosting a large infrastructure conference next year. </p><p>   China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, meanwhile, removed limits on the number of visitors allowed at theaters, concerts and music festivals, provided the event is held in a low-risk area with no continuing outbreak. </p><p></p>",
