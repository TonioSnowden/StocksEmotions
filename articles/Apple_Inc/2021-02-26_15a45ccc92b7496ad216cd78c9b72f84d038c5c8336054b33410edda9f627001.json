We want an entire rethink. Can you help? </strong></p> <p>Gosh, I know the feeling. What I would give right now for somebody else's cooking, a packed pub, a restaurant with white tablecloths. Luckily I enjoy cooking. Weeks of conjuring up every single meal at home, however, has resulted in a strange phenomenon: these days I enter the village shop or a supermarket at the end of a working day, and I can't think of a single thing to cook. I stare from ingredient to ingredient but can't compute anything, as if I've been tasked with solving a series of impossible equations, not throwing together a simple Tuesday supper.</p> <p>Fortunately, I have quite the store of cookware, cutlery and crockery, and this does help to keep things interesting. Using a favourite enamel tin to gently cook some rhubarb until it collapses, or a loved, battered old platter to serve a roast chicken: these are small joys, but I like to think of them as delight-inducing punctuation marks in what will in all probability be an unremarkable day.</p> <p>So, it is worth making the most of daily rituals. It's also worth making sure our equipment is up to scratch; now really is the time to get rid of that mug you've always despised and those holey tea towels with the burnt corners.</p> <p>For everyday cooking, I very much like the pots and pans made by Shropshire's Netherton Foundry, a small-scale, family-owned business that makes cookware using techniques passed down from 18th-century industrialists. Its pots and pans are no-nonsense and sturdy, items to use and treasure for years.</p> <p>As for tableware, I am a big fan of French company Gien, founded in 1821 in the Loire Valley. Its <a href=\"https://www.artedona.com/en/Dinnerware/Dinnerware-with-coloured-rim/Gien-Filets-Bleus.html\">Filet</a> range of plates, bowls, platters, mugs and more, really does it for me, probably because it looks like it could be old. Plates and bowls have a delicately scalloped edge, with two elegantly thin hand-painted lines. Choose from a variety of colours including bright red, grass green and lemon yellow. It's a beautifully classic range, very chic and just playful enough to add some spring sparkle to your table. (The prices are fairly reasonable, too — a mug costs €35.)</p> <p>Cutlery I find more tricky. Generally, I buy sets of old knives, forks and spoons from antique markets, and I never worry very much about things matching. I've been converted recently, though, to another French company, Sabre, which makes beautiful new cutlery sets. I like its <a href=\"https://www.sabre.fr/FR_en/flatware/sets/24-pieces-set/24-pieces-set-bistrot-vintage-solid-orange.html\">Bistrot</a> design very much, particularly because it comes in a range of colours including fern green and bright orange. (I am like a moth to a flame to a good colour selection.) The bamboo design is a classic, too.</p> <p>What else is on my wish list? Cabana's <a href=\"https://cabanamagazine.com/collections/all-products/products/ss19-hexagon-plate\">marbleised</a> plates and bowls are fantastically psychedelic, and their hexagonal shape would introduce a refreshing change to the rest of our dinnerware. Cabana also sells the glassware of my dreams: a set of six handblown <a href=\"https://cabanamagazine.com/collections/glassware/products/palazzo-glasses-set-of-6\">tumblers</a>, each engraved with the facade of a different Venetian palazzo. Buying myself a set of these would be the treatiest of treats — it costs £1,710 — but seeing as I can't get to Venice at the moment, Venice might have to come to me. </p> <p>I've been adding to my own cupboards slowly over the past year. More often than not, I tend to buy old things. I've rooted through junk and antique shops, when possible, and brought home platters decorated with transfer prints of flowers in gaudy colours. I've bought practical things from eBay — enamel pie tins in shades of pale blue and mint green — and less practical but more fabulous things, such as a set of 12 1960s glass cocktail stirrers topped with tiny glass animals: a frog, a hedgehog, a squirrel, a swan . . . (These are perfect speared through a couple of glace cherries, and really do spice up cocktail hour.) Plus, things that fall perhaps somewhere between practical and fabulous: a set of 1970s bamboo-handled cutlery.</p> <p>For Christmas, Duncan gave me a set of vintage Portmeirion plates in bright blue with a black Greek key border. He also went on a bit of a majolica (tin-glazed pottery) binge in November in preparation for a season of feasting, picking up various dishes and bowls on eBay. My favourite of his purchases is a tiny jug fashioned from shells in a dazzling palette of soft pinks, yellows and greens. I am thrilled every time this makes an appearance on the table. As I say, this lockdown is all about small joys — pouring milk from a jug covered in pink shells included.</p> <p><em>Luke Edward Hall will discuss the dos and don'ts of interior design at the FT Weekend Digital Festival, March 18-20.
