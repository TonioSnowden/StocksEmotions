  "text": "<p>   After a draft of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade became public, Max Hoberman spoke to attorneys for the independent videogame company he runs about covering travel costs for employees if they needed to leave Texas to get an abortion. The lawyers warned of legal risks, so Mr. Hoberman made another offer: The company, Austin-based Certain Affinity Inc., would help some employees move out of the state for good. </p><p>    Ron Horne, CEO of Pennco Inc., a Houston-area manufacturer of municipal water treatment chemicals, has made a different decision: He says he is leaving it to employees to cover the cost of treatments -- including abortions -- that don't fall under the company's health insurance plan. \"If you couldn't get a dental treatment in Texas, I doubt that I would pay for you to get it somewhere else,\" he said. </p><p>   Small businesses based in states like Texas where officials are implementing bans on most or nearly all abortions face choices. Given the costs and insurance policies, many smaller companies especially find it a challenge to balance expenses, legal risks and employees with different views on a divisive issue. </p><p>   Some say failing to strike the right balance will put them at a significant disadvantage in recruiting and retaining talent. Some companies have already changed their policies; others don't plan to make any changes. </p><p>   Many companies of all sizes have avoided discussing the issue publicly. Nationwide, about half of midsize and large companies say they plan to offer some assistance to employees in states that restrict or prohibit abortion, with covering travel expenses the most common option, said Brian Kropp, vice president of research at Gartner, a consulting firm. </p><p>   Many of the companies that haven't taken action have told him they are worried about the legal risk or haven't yet decided on their policy, Mr. Kropp said. Some have indicated that they don't want to get involved in political issues, that their CEO opposes abortion or that they aren't sure how to provide benefits across their entire workforce. </p><p>   Texas last year banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and allows citizens to sue abortion providers and those who assist them. Since the Supreme Court removed federal constitutional protections for abortion in a ruling in late June, Texas' leaders have moved to enforce laws banning abortion throughout pregnancy. Abortions are now largely unavailable in about a dozen states, either because of new bans or legal uncertainty. Another half-dozen or more states could ban or restrict abortion in the coming days and weeks. </p><p>   \"The court is really putting us in a challenging position,\" said Patrick Curry, CEO of FarBridge Inc., an Austin-based videogame studio with 20 employees, most in Texas. \"This issue touches the economic challenges, the medical challenges,\" he said. \"It puts us in a legal quandary. We are having to look at it from all those perspectives, but also from what is the right thing to do.\" </p><p>   Some companies, such as Dallas-based Match Group Inc., began outlining their response last year. The company's then-CEO, Shar Dubey, provided initial financing for a fund, administered by Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles, to assist Texas-based employees or their dependents with travel and related costs associated with getting an abortion out of state. </p><p>    Joanna Rice, head of corporate social responsibility for Match, said she now spends hours every day discussing options with other companies. \"Small, midsize, big firms, everyone is trying to figure out what can we do, what do we have to do, what are we able to do,\" said Ms. Rice. Match, the operator of an online dating site, has about 2,500 employees, including roughly 400 in Texas. </p><p>   Texas has about three million small businesses that employ about half the state's private-sector workers, according to U.S. census data. Small businesses typically offer fully insured health plans, which are regulated at the state level. Texas is one of 11 states that bar state-regulated health plans from covering abortion services, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p><p>   Midsize and large companies generally operate self-funded health plans, in which employers pay workers' health claims with their own money. Those plans are regulated at the federal level. </p><p>    Jessica Huffman, the owner of Nourish Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar, with two locations in Houston, offers health insurance to full-time workers and discounted benefits to part-timers. The company will honor a worker's request for extended time off for an abortion or other reproductive care, as it has with other medical needs, but doesn't have the funds to cover paid leaves, said Ms. Huffman, who has roughly 20 employees. </p><p>   \"We just don't have the resources,\" said Ms. Huffman, who is pregnant. \"I am actually uninsured.\" </p><p>   Certain Affinity, the Austin videogame developer, is offering to relocate employees if the law in their state \"restricts access to what a majority of medical experts consider essential care.\" Mr. Hoberman, the company's founder and CEO, said he crafted the language of his offer so that it addressed not only reproductive care, but also transgender treatments and other medical services. </p><p>   Mr. Hoberman said that the company hasn't yet created a mechanism for determining what falls under the policy. The company, which has about 230 employees, mostly in Texas, had been advised against offering to cover travel expenses in part because of the chance the business could become a target for lawsuits. </p><p>   \"Companies like Apple, Meta, their leaders have the benefit of not being based here,\" he said. \"We are a lot more vulnerable.\" </p><p></p>",
