  "text": "<p>(Prime Video)</p><p>When Aaron Sorkin was approached about the idea of writing a movie about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, his first thought was that he didn't want to write a traditional biopic.</p><p>\"With a biopic, it's very tough to shake the structure that has become so familiar to audiences,\" says Mr. Sorkin, \"The cradle-to-grave structure where this happened and this happened, and this happened, and this happened—kind of a greatest hits album, done by a cover band.\"</p><p>For \"Being the Ricardos,\" now streaming on Prime Video, Mr. Sorkin went with a structure that will be familiar to his audience: a condensed, behind-the-scenes workplace-and-relationship drama. The film is set during a week of shooting \"I Love Lucy.\" In the same week, Ms. Ball reveals that she is pregnant and is accused of being a communist. Mr. Arnaz, meanwhile, appears on the cover of a tabloid with another woman.</p><p>\"I like claustrophobic spaces, claustrophobic time,\" says Mr. Sorkin, who made the halls and doorways of the White House a fixture in \"The West Wing.\" \"By focusing on this one week in their lives, we would learn about them and we would also get treated to some fireworks.\"</p><p>Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem portray the couple. The cast also includes Nina Arianda and J.K. Simmons as Vivian Vance and William Frawley, who play the Ricardos' on-screen friends, Ethel and Fred Mertz.</p><p>For Mr. Sorkin, the story hinges on two incompatible truths: While Ms. Ball craved domesticity, she loved her career and the fact that it started to flourish in her 40s. While Mr. Arnaz supported, respected and promoted his wife, Mr. Sorkin says, he couldn't handle being second banana.</p><p>\"Those two hairline fractures in these people were going to make it so that two people, so in love with each other, two people who we're rooting for so badly, it was never going to work,\" says Mr. Sorkin, who wrote and directed the film. \"It was doomed from the start.\"</p><p>New Release: \"Encanto\"</p><p>(Disney+)</p><p>In Disney's new animated musical, \"Encanto,\" the Madrigal family lives in a magical home in Colombia where each member has a unique gift: from shape-shifting and talking to animals to curing ailments with baked goods. Only daughter Mirabel, it seems, hasn't been offered a gift. But it is Mirabel who notices that their magical casita is falling apart and goes looking for a way to save it.</p><p>The film has been in theaters since November and begins streaming Friday on Disney+.</p><p>Charise Castro Smith—one of the film's writers and its co-director—says that though it isn't a Christmas movie, it resonates with the kinds of films people watch during the holidays. \"Encanto,\" she notes, takes place among a large family in their family home, with all of the drama and joy that comes with it. The movie was also made from home during the pandemic.</p><p>\"This movie was made by our 800 crew members from their homes with their families,\" she says. \"So, it is very much a movie that I think is inspired by family, by the joys and the challenges of family.\"</p><p>An Expert Recommends: 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas!', 'The Year Without a Santa Claus'</p><p>(Peacock, Amazon)</p><p>Loren Bouchard is the creator and co-creator, respectively, of the animated comedies \"Bob's Burgers\" (Fox, Hulu) and \"Central Park\" (Apple TV+). Here, he recommends a pair of animated holiday classics. As told to Chris Kornelis:</p><p>\"I grew up in the '70s, so we watched every holiday special that came on, every year. As someone who is now (mostly) grown-up and has made a few holiday-themed, (occasionally) musical episodes of animated television, I feel indebted to the strange world of those TV specials: the deeply melancholy Charlie Brown specials, the deeply strange Rankin/Bass stop-motion Christmas specials, especially 'The Year Without a Santa Claus' (Amazon), and definitely 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' (Peacock).</p><p>\"'The Grinch' was unique in that it was the coming together of two towering pillars of entertainment: Chuck Jones and Dr. Seuss (Ted Geisel).</p><p>\"Dr. Seuss books were everywhere. We knew 'Green Eggs and Ham,' 'The Cat in the Hat,' and 'Horton Hears a Who!' like they were foundational myths. Chuck Jones was responsible for some of the near perfect 'late' Bugs Bunny masterpieces, such as 'What's Opera, Doc?' that combined Wagner with pure silliness and ends with a kind of sublime sadness.</p><p>\"You could feel both of them, in a lovely balance, in 'The Grinch.' The big eyes on the poor dog and the extended gags with the sleigh were pure Jones. The language and the strangely familiar world were undiluted Seuss.</p><p>\"The specials were definitely flawed. I see now how white (and smug?) everyone looks in Whoville when they come out and sing together. And I see now how exclusively Christian nearly all of the specials were. It's a shame, because in other ways they were anarchic, and they feel like they share some DNA with other oddballs that somehow found a spot on American television at the time</p><p>\"Even though new specials might not reach as wide an audience as these classics, I hope they acknowledge the diversity of their audience. Our shop's going to keep trying to make holiday episodes and specials that are joyfully weird and yet are worth rewatching year after year. I hope others do, too.\"</p><p>Holiday Movie Notes: Favorites, Finds and New Releases</p><p>• Every year the \"Deck the Hallmark\" podcast reviews every Hallmark holiday movie.
