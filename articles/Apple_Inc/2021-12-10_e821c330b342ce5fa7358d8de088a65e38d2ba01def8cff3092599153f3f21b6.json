  "title": "Household wealth has surged an astonishing $36 trillion. What that means for markets.",
  "text": "<p>Scott Grannis, author of the Calafia Beach Pundit blog and former chief economist for Western Asset Management, had a different interpretation. He pointed out that while liabilities of households have grown 21% from their 2008 peak, net worth has more than tripled. After adjusting for inflation, household net worth has increased 11 fold over the past 70 years.</p><p>Another way to look at it — adjusting for inflation and population growth, net worth per capita has soared from $72,000 to $432,000 over the last 70 years.</p><p>Both charts, he noted, are running ahead of their long-term trend line. “This could be a replay of what we saw in 2000 and 2007, when some markets got very overextended. By that I mean that for the next several years a mere reversion to trend would mean very modest returns for investors,” he said.</p><p>Those low returns could materialize from inflation. “It would not be surprising to see net worth fall below its long-term trend, as it did during the high-inflation 1970s,” he said. With inflation running at 7%, the average interest rate on federal debt at about 2%, the real value of federal debt is falling by about 5% a year.</p><p>“In other words, inflation is subtracting over $1 trillion of the real value of federal debt outstanding every year at the same time inflation is boosting government revenues and nominal GDP. This means that the private sector is effectively paying an additional $1 trillion per year in taxes to the federal government (aka the inflation tax),” he said.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>The key report of the day is the November consumer-price index, due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, with expectations for a 0.7% monthly rise to take the year-over-year reading to 6.7%. There's also the preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for December due for release.</p><p>CEO Elon Musk continued selling shares in Tesla TSLA, taking his sales to nearly $12 billion, though his exercise of options has meant his overall stake in the electric-vehicle maker has risen.</p><p>Oracle ORCL shares jumped 10% in after-hours trade, after the database giant beat earnings and sales estimates and authorized a $10 billion stock buyback.</p><p>Costco Wholesale COST topped earnings expectations as it reported 15% comparable-store sales growth.</p><p>Online pet food seller Chewy CHWY reported a wider-than-forecast loss for the fiscal third quarter.</p><p>Getty Images said it will merge with special-purpose acquisition company CC Neuberger Principal Holdings II PRPB in a deal valuing the photo service at $4.8 billion, or 15.2 times estimated 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.</p><p>The markets</p><p>After the first down day in four sessions, U.S. stock futures ES00NQ00 were back to a winning posture.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Ywas 1.51% ahead of the CPI data.</p><p>Need to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
