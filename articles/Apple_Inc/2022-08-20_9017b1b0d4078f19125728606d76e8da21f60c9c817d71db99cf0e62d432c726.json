  "title": "The Weekend Interview with James Hankins:  The -2-",
  "text": "<p>   Mr. Hankins considers himself a classical liberal -- \"I think less government is better than more.\" But he doesn't see Anglo-American constitutionalism as the final word on political thought. \"Look at the humanities George Washington was trained in,\" he says. \"If you read about Washington's education, it was basically on a Renaissance humanist model -- not only memorizing moral maxims but reading Plutarch and Roman history and the famous plays of antiquity that were so crucial in communicating proper forms of behavior.\" </p><p>   I try to suggest a compromise: Surely we're not going back to virtue-based politics, but maybe there are things we can learn from the humanist tradition? Mr. Hankins rejects the premise. \"I'm not sure I agree with that. You need a moral revolution to make it happen, but political meritocracy is something that can be revived, in my view.\" </p><p>   Mr. Hankins, 67, has been teaching at Harvard for 37 years and speaks with affection about his students. \"The younger generation out there is disgusted with the older one,\" he says. \"The people who get all the attention from the press are the woke, but there's another big part of the young population that's ready for a moral revolution.\" </p><p>   And not just in the U.S. He has traveled and taught in China and says \"it's happening there, too, subterraneously. It's building. The scientism. The abdication of moral judgment. The idea that our leaders are just following the science, following the algorithms, following the experts, and we're not even going to look into the faces of people who are losing their jobs because we shut the economy down? We're going to let our grandparents die in isolation and talk to them on iPhones as they're dying? It's obscene.\" </p><p>   All this talk about venal, incompetent leaders made me wonder about that short list of Mr. Hankins's. Who's on it? \"I think, for example, of some genuinely accomplished people who went to work for the Trump White House out of a sense of duty, knowing the hell they'd take for it. James Mattis, William Barr, Mike Esper, Don McGahn, some others.\" </p><p>   On the subject of Donald Trump, we each lament the inability of some otherwise serious people, on the left and the right, to talk about the 45th president in anything but the language of civilizational catastrophe. Why is Mr. Hankins, the author of a 700-page book on virtuous political leadership, not similarly undone by Mr. Trump? Because his profession has prepared him to take the long view. </p><p>   \"I think of it as an historian,\" he says. \"Many people don't think deeply about what it would be like to live in a different time. They have no sense of comparison. Thinking long about history, you get a much broader view of human life. History is a road to sanity.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Swaim is an editorial page writer for the Journal. </p><p></p>",
