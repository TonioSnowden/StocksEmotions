  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>: the biggest US food delivery group <strong>DoorDash</strong> is preparing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cccd541-0a44-4002-af6e-35fe7ef46445\">make its first investment</a> in Europe by taking a stake in <strong>Gorillas</strong>, the fast-growing Berlin-based grocery delivery app.</p> <h2>Why is SoftBank betting on Roche?</h2> <p><strong>SoftBank</strong>'s latest disruptive technology play: a Swiss pharmaceutical company founded in the 19th century.</p> <p>Just what is a Japanese conglomerate, better known for investments in tech darlings such as <strong>Uber </strong>and <strong>Klarna</strong>, doing as it quietly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35b3ae51-a1b4-4617-aad7-0d08f2522ceb\">builds a $5bn stake</a> in the 125-year-old drugmaker <strong>Roche</strong>?</p> <p>DD's theory: lurking within the pharma group is an under-appreciated tech company whose time <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdbfae59-175e-44cb-8de8-7f270caef71f\">has finally arrived</a>.</p> <p>Bloomberg, which first <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/softbank-is-said-to-build-5-billion-stake-in-pharma-giant-roche\">broke the news</a> of the stake on Tuesday, reported that SoftBank believes Roche's Genentech division is significantly undervalued. While Roche took control of the San Francisco-based biotechnology company more than a decade ago, Genentech's use of big data to discover and develop drugs is increasingly in vogue, and could benefit from a shift towards so-called precision medicine.</p> <p>But when DD saw who was behind SoftBank's trade, we began to wonder if there was more to this than meets the eye.</p> <p>That's because the architect of the Roche investment is <strong>Akshay Naheta</strong>, the former <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> trader who runs <strong>SB Northstar</strong>, a unit of SoftBank set up by the group's founder <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong> last year to manage its investments in public equities.</p> <p>Shortly after SoftBank set up the internal hedge fund a year ago, it became notorious for carrying out the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75587aa6-1f1f-4e9d-b334-3ff866753fa2\">“Nasdaq whale”</a> trades involving outsized bets on options in technology stocks.</p> <p>Naheta and his trades have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6663eb2f-dc75-4c9c-91b7-c0b2dce272e5\">featured regularly</a> in DD over the past year — for those just hearing of the 40-year-old SoftBank executive, this recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b29f452a-40c4-4f62-b193-d0c90af84bfe\">profile</a> from DD's Arash Massoudi and Rob Smith is the best place to start.</p> <p>Perhaps the quintessential “Akshay trade” was an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/847436a6-dba9-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\">intricate $1bn bet</a> on the stock of <strong>Wirecard</strong>, which SoftBank executives <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8eec9d0-0c85-467d-8cb1-467ad87adced\">still narrowly profited</a> from even after the German payments company collapsed in one of Europe's biggest-ever accounting scandals.</p> <p>Is there any similar financial engineering behind SoftBank's Roche bet?</p> <p>SB Northstar was able to quietly build such a large stake without triggering any stock market disclosure because it purchased the company's non-voting shares.</p> <p>Stocks with two share classes are rife for arbitrage. Case in point: when Naheta ran a small London hedge fund before joining SoftBank, one of its most profitable trades involved successfully exploiting a valuation gap that had opened up between two share classes of <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140624006839/en/Knight-Assets-Co.-Engaging-with-Management-of-Tata-Motors-to-Discuss-Possible-Solutions-to-Unlock-Shareholder-Value\">Indian carmaker</a> <strong>Tata Motors</strong>.</p> <p>But Roche's voting shares aren't very liquid. They're largely owned by the <strong>Hoffmann-La Roche</strong> family and the rival Swiss drugmaker <strong>Novartis</strong>, which still owns a third of the shares as a result of a failed takeover bid two decades ago. It's hard to see how anyone could really trade around this.</p> <p>A person close to the deal insisted there was no wrinkle or catch, and that SoftBank simply bought a lot of shares in a stock it believed would go up significantly. They added that the deal reflected a back-to-basics approach at Northstar after the Nasdaq whale trades ultimately resulted in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0edb7c17-58e6-4ded-acfa-1822440a926c\">hefty losses</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>With a healthy dose of typical SoftBank hyperbole, they described Roche as “a Google equivalent in healthcare”, saying that the company with a stock market value of $380bn “should be a $1tn business”.</p> <p>Has SoftBank entered a new phase as a value investor that eschews financial engineering? Anything is possible, we guess.</p> <h2>The power dynamics that complicate private equity's football deals&#xa0;</h2> <p>When <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong> tried to buy into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c8fc484-fcf5-46c4-b705-1282a0742437\">Italy's</a> <strong>Serie A </strong>and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15a10f7e-d32c-4cc3-9cc8-e600e9b38941\">Germany's</a> <strong>Bundesliga</strong>, talks fell apart due to opposition from football clubs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now it has been met with opposition once again in its attempt to buy into Spain's <strong>La Liga</strong>. This time it's from <strong>Real Madrid</strong>, one of the biggest and most successful clubs, DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Sam Agini <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/229347e4-2f9b-473c-b91c-93145cdc2e55#comments-anchor\">report</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Under the project, known as “La Liga Impulso”, CVC would invest €2.7bn. Just under €2.5bn would go to clubs — with Real Madrid and <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> getting about €260m each.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's a similar amount to the “welcome bonus” they would've received had the shortlived and highly controversial European <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1af5993-21ed-4b92-9679-27f71482f76d\">Super League</a> plans gone ahead.&#xa0;</p> <p>So, why do they oppose the deal? Power dynamics can lend some explanation.</p> <p>Real Madrid's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cfdbbb9-75e4-4374-8214-977a1ddfce68\">president</a> <strong>Florentino Pérez</strong> led the plans for a breakaway Super League. The club, alongside Barcelona, is still battling for the future of the project despite strong opposition from La Liga, led by <strong>Javier Tebas</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Essentially, some of the best clubs see themselves as bigger than their domestic leagues.&#xa0;</p> <p>So they'll be unhappy that La Liga has done a deal which, to them, seems designed to force their hand. Real Madrid was left out of La Liga's talks with CVC and felt blindsided by the news, people involved tell DD. (Though it's worth remembering that Pérez himself took a lot of people by surprise with the Super League plan.)</p> <p>Some within the Real Madrid camp are also annoyed at the role of CVC. Pérez pitched his Super League plans to CVC, among other potential investors, two years before they became public this spring. The firm didn't get involved, but has instead led an alternative plan to invest in the domestic league — which could make a breakaway deal harder.&#xa0;</p> <p>CVC's dealmakers aren't naive, and have knowingly walked into a longstanding conflict between Real Madrid and La Liga.&#xa0;</p> <p>They're hoping that either Real Madrid can be won over, or that the deal can get through without it, partly because of the speed and certainty of its cash offer to financially-stretched clubs.&#xa0;</p> <p>La Liga's 42 clubs could vote as soon as next week, and CVC doesn't need unanimity to get the deal through. However, even if it succeeds without Real Madrid, managing an investment that was vehemently opposed by one of its most important stakeholders won't be easy.</p> <p>So what's Real Madrid to do? It could try to persuade other clubs to oppose the deal, or take the matter to court. It wouldn't be the first time the club sued the league: just this year there was a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/la-liga-europe-madrid-lawsuits-soccer-6ec86b92d0b277fc9dfdaa8e5ab3f65a\">case</a> over television rights.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Other parties might get involved, as well. A rival bidder could come in, potentially offering loans instead of a stake sale. Or smaller clubs in the leagues below La Liga's two tournaments could object that if promoted, they wouldn't benefit from the funds.&#xa0;</p> <p>The fact that CVC is willing to navigate this minefield is a sign of just how much value its dealmakers — already juggling potential deals in rugby, volleyball, tennis and basketball — see in European football.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has hired <strong>Kunal Ahuja</strong>, former executive director at <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>, as head of mergers and acquisitions in south-east Asia, says <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-04/barclays-said-to-hire-stanchart-s-ahuja-for-southeast-asia-m-a?srnd=deals&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">Bloomberg</a>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Craft Ventures</strong> <a href=\"https://medium.com/craft-ventures/announcing-craft-iii-1-1-billion-for-saas-and-marketplaces-c3c34448db17\">has promoted</a> four new partners for its investment team.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher</strong> has recruited <strong>Vadim Mahmoudov</strong> as a partner in its tax department.
