  "text": "<p>\"On one hand this was very funny because until recently these people had completely different names and they looked different, too,\" said Mr. Vishnevsky, an opposition candidate in St. Petersburg. \"On the other,\" he continued, \"they are specifically trying to confuse voters, to deceive them, so that those who want to vote for me vote for one of them by mistake.\" </p><p>Mr. Vishnevsky's run-in with his doppelgängers is one of the odder obstacles facing opposition candidates under the watch of President Putin. PHOTO: Ksenia Ivanova for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Mr. Vishnevsky's run-in with his doppelgängers is one of the odder obstacles facing opposition candidates under the watch of President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Some opposition groups and independent media have been outlawed as extremists or foreign agents—a loosely defined term in Russia, which means that anyone given the label is barred from running for office. An analysis published in June by independent electoral watchdog Golos found that more than nine million Russians are ineligible to stand as candidates in this weekend's election under various new restrictions before it, too, was declared to be a foreign agent.</p><p>Russia's state censor has accused U.S. tech giants, such as Google and Apple Inc., of meddling in the vote by providing a platform for prominent dissident Alexei Navalny, in a reversal of the U.S.'s allegations that Russia tried to sway the result of America's 2016 presidential election. Mr. Navalny's app, advising Russians on the strongest antigovernment candidate in each electoral district—which he calls smart voting—wasn't available on the Apple and Google app stores on some devices as of Saturday morning. Meanwhile, the Smart Voting bot on the popular Telegram messenger was blocked after Telegram said it would limit the functioning of bots associated with election campaigns to respect Russia's ban on campaigning during voting.</p><p>Leonid Volkov, Mr. Navalny's top strategist, wrote on Telegram that the companies \"caved to the Kremlin's blackmail.\" Apple and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Navalny was thrown into prison earlier this year after failing to turn up for parole meetings. He said he was recuperating in Berlin after recovering from a poisoning attack.</p><p>Fyodor Krasheninnikov, a political analyst who fled to Lithuania last year after being fined and jailed for his internet posts, said the Kremlin is using all the tools at its disposal to limit the size of the opposition vote, from manipulating voter lists to refusing to register opposition candidates or parties ahead of the ballot, which opens for early voting on Friday ahead of the main election day, on Sunday.</p><p>\"It is never happened in such a concentrated form and just before the elections,\" Mr. Krasheninnikov said. \"These are the most unfair and dishonest elections in many years.\"</p><p>There is little prospect that the pro-Putin United Russia party will lose its majority. It currently holds 334 of the parliament's 450 seats. But analysts said a strong showing would strengthen Mr. Putin's hand in 2024, when he must decide whether to leave office or extend his stay in the Kremlin for another 12 years, as changes to the country's constitution last year now allow.</p><p>Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied that there is anything untoward or undemocratic about the election, and ruling party candidates and their supporters have engaged in some traditional campaigning. Mr. Putin also recently approved one-time payments to pensioners, military personnel and police to help offset rising food prices—a classic incumbent's pre-election move, but one that his critics have called a bribe to shore up key voting blocs.</p><p>The Russian leader, who has been in power for over 20 years, has said the credibility of the vote is important. In a national address on Thursday he said Russia needs a strong and authoritative parliament and that he was counting on voters to \"elect deputies who will work for the good and in the name of our beloved motherland, in the interests of our people and every citizen of Russia.\"</p><p>It is playing out a little differently on the ground. In some districts, opposition supporters continue to put their weight behind the strongest anti-Putin candidate. In others, confusion reigns and candidates of all stripes might stumble across opponents with similar names representing sound-alike parties.</p><p>In Moscow, Anastasia Udaltsova of the long running Communist Party of the Russian Federation is up against Anna Udalova of the more recent but similarly named Communists of Russia party. There are two candidates running named Valery Rashkin, though in different districts, again running for similarly-named parties.</p><p>Mr. Vishnevsky's challengers appear to be charting unexplored reaches of political mimicry. Besides adopting the same name, at least one has grown a beard and cropped his hair to resemble the original Boris Vishnevsky.</p><p>Russia's election commission confirmed that one of the doubles is a man known until recently as Viktor Bykov, a 59-year-old deputy on one of St. Petersburg's municipal councils and an assistant to the deputy speaker of the city assembly.</p><p>The third Boris Vishnevsky is 43 years old and works at a construction company. He was previously known as Alexey Shmelev.</p><p>Both legally changed their names, with the only difference being the middle or patronymic names, usually derived from the first name of a person's father.</p><p>\"This is a unique situation in Russian politics,\" said Mr. Vishnevsky, who is running for a seat in the State Duma on the ticket of one of the few permitted opposition parties, Yabloko. He is also running to keep his seat on the St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly.</p><p>\"Imagine a person comes to a polling station, is given a ballot and there are three Boris Vishnevskys in a row,\" he said</p><p>The Wall Street Journal was unable to reach the other Boris Vishnevskys for comment. One is running for the Russian Ecological Party, popularly known as the Greens, and is competing against the original Mr. Vishnevsky for a Duma seat. The other is an independent candidate challenging his namesake in the local assembly.</p><p>Calls to their places of work went unanswered. Messages left with staff weren't returned and there was no response via social media.</p><p>Mr. Vishnevsky appealed to the Election Commission asking that his opponents' original names be written on the ballot, minimizing the risk that his share of the vote would be diluted, but was rebuffed.</p><p>Ella Pamfilova, chair of Russia's Central Election Commission, said those names could only be displayed on information posters at polling stations, not on the ballot itself.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the current law is very liberal towards the so-called 'doubles,'\" Ms. Pamfilova wrote on the commission's official Telegram messaging channel earlier this month. She then scolded the two other Boris Vishnevskys for their \"dirty tactics\" and recommended they withdraw from the race.</p><p>Write to Ann M.
