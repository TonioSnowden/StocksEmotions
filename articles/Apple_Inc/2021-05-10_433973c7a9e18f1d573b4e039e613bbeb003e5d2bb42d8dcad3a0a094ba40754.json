  "text": "<p>Amazon set a record in the corporate bond market on Monday, getting closer to the level of interest paid by the US government than any US company has previously managed in a fundraising.&#xa0;</p> <p>The ecommerce group raised $18.5bn of debt across bonds of eight different maturities, ranging from two to 40 years, according to people familiar with the deal. On its $1bn two-year bond, it paid just 0.1 percentage points more than the yield on equivalent US Treasury debt, a record according to data from Refinitiv. </p> <p>The additional yield above Treasuries paid by companies, or spread, is an indication of investors' perception of the risk of lending to a company versus the supposedly risk-free rate on US government debt.</p> <p>Amazon, one of the pandemic's runaway winners, last week posted its second consecutive quarter of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2b05040-3164-46f3-8bd5-399e6214ea74\">$100bn-plus revenue</a> and said its net income tripled in the first quarter from the same period a year ago, to $8.1bn.</p> <p>The company had $33.8bn in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of March, according to a recent filing, a high for the period.</p> <p>“They don't need the cash but money is cheap,” said Monica Erickson, head of the investment-grade corporate team at DoubleLine Capital in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Spreads have fallen dramatically since the Federal Reserve stepped in to shore up the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f629ead0-d40f-43ba-b104-95b1e02fe174\">corporate bond</a> market in the face of a severe sell-off caused by the pandemic, and now average levels below those from before coronavirus struck.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>That means it is a very attractive time for companies to borrow cash from investors, even if they do not have an urgent need to. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/84cf4073-a674-4a93-aef9-dcc1832a65cb\">Amazon</a> also set a record for the lowest spread on a 20-year corporate bond, 0.7 percentage points, breaking through Alphabet's borrowing cost record from last year, according to Refinitiv data. It also matched the 0.2 percentage point spread first paid by Apple for a three-year bond in 2013 and fell just shy of the 0.47 percentage points paid by Procter &amp; Gamble&#xa0;for a 10-year bond last year.</p> <p>Investor orders for Amazon's fundraising fell just short of $50bn, according to the people, in a sign of the rampant demand from investors for US corporate debt, even as rising interest rates have eroded the value of higher-quality fixed-rate bonds.</p> <p>Highly rated US corporate bonds still offer interest rates above much of the rest of the world. </p> <p>Amazon's two-year bond also carried a sustainability label that has become increasingly attractive to investors. The company said the money would be used to fund projects in five areas, including renewable energy, clean transport and sustainable housing.&#xa0;</p> <p>It listed a number of other potential uses for the rest of the debt including buying back stock, acquisitions and capital expenditure.&#xa0;</p> <p>In a recent investor call, Brian Olsavsky, chief financial officer, said the company would be “investing heavily” in the “middle mile” of delivery, which includes air cargo and road haulage, on top of expanding its “last mile” network of vans and home delivery drivers.</p><p>Source: Joe Rennison, Dave Lee and Camilla Hodgson 2021 'New Amazon bond rivals yield on US Treasuries in record-breaking sale' FT.com 10 May.
