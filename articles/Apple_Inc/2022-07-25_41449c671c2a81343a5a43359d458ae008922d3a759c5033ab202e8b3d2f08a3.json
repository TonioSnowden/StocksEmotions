  "text": "<p>The Financial Times does not often feature in Washington legal dramas. Last week, however, the pink 'un took centre stage on the court steps — at least visually and symbolically.</p> <p>The reason? On Friday, Steve Bannon, the former adviser to Donald Trump and intellectual godfather to the Make America Great Again movement, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbc4510f-4623-4d0f-9d8a-11c079e59fbf\">convicted</a> of contempt of Congress for refusing to co-operate with the congressional inquiry into his role in the January 6 uprising. In theory this implies that he could receive up to two years in jail, when the sentencing takes place in October. But he plans to appeal (which could take two years to hear). And he announced these plans with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=bannon+court+financial+times&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwidmamn0ZH5AhWskokEHUZACokQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=707&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=fIFzlsoKDpvKhM\">a copy of the Financial Times in hand</a>, waving it to the cameras, as a prop. </p> <p>We would love to think that this is simply because the FT is essential reading (which it is). But as Bannon explained to me yesterday, in his typically emotive style, there is a bigger message here. “I read the FT cover to cover each day because this is the paper of the liberal global order and the party of Davos,” he says. “But the liberal global order is coming crashing down and a populist, nationalist uprising is coming — there is a big tectonic shift coming. So I say that the must-reads for my audience are the FT, Economist and Guardian, to understand this liberal global order.”</p> <p>Now I daresay that some members of this “liberal global order” (and FT audience) might roll their eyes at this — or wince in disgust. And, as part of that globalist tribe, I personally disagree and dislike many of Bannon's views. But whatever you think of the man, it is worth listening for at least three reasons.</p> <p>The first is that Bannon is deeply convinced that Trump is going to stage a come back; indeed, many of his supporters expect that Trump will declare his intention to run for presidency in the next couple of weeks. </p> <p>Secondly, Friday's conviction of Bannon and last week's televised investigation of the January 6 uprising have not dented the Trump posse's belief that he can come back. Democrats might find this hard to believe given the shocking images from Thursday's January 6 inquiry: who can forget Josh Hawley, the far-right senator, giving a fist pump to the rioters — and then <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jan-6-clip-josh-hawley-fleeing-capitol-rioters-proves-opportunist-rcna39669\">sprinting away later</a>, in fear; or the secret service officers with Mike Pence, the vice-president, calling their families to say goodbye since they thought they would die; or Trump repeatedly refusing to admit that he had lost the election, in camera out-takes. Indeed, the material was so damning that many observers presumed that this ruled out any chance of another Trump run.</p> <p>But Bannon insists that the hearings simply revved up Trump's base even more, and that a combination of economic pain, high energy prices and anger about the war in Ukraine will create a MAGA landslide this autumn. Indeed, he argues that the fall of leaders such as Mario Draghi show that the “globalists” are already in retreat (again). And argues that if the Republicans win the House in November, which they seem likely to do, they will stage their own rerun of the January 6 hearings that will clear President Trump's name and “get to the bottom of the entire story” (and, one presumes, take revenge on their critics.) “President Trump and MAGA will demand it, a real investigation with Jordan, Banks, Gaetz, MTG [Marjorie Taylor Greene], and others,” said Bannon, adding, “McCarthy won't be Speaker unless he signs on.”</p> <p>Some Republicans might beg to differ. It is notable that Pence (who is reportedly mulling a presidential run himself in 2024), has refrained from commenting on the investigation into the Capitol riots. “Some people want this election to be about the past, but elections are always about the future,” he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence/status/1550600295788544000\">tweeted</a> on Friday. “If the Republican Party allows itself to become consumed by yesterday's grievances, we will lose.”</p> <p>But, to my mind, there is one — crystal clear — message in all of this: the last year's events have shattered popular trust in the rule of law and legal process among Democrats and Republicans alike. That is ominous; whatever you think of Bannon and his FT prop. </p> <p>So could Bannon's anti-elite, anti-globalist — anti-FT — attacks be swelling in force, again? What you think Ed? </p> <h1>Recommended reading</h1> <ul>  <li><p>One remarkable feature of the January 6 hearings has been the testimony of two of Trump's former aides: Sarah Matthews, the former deputy press secretary, and Cassidy Hutchinson*, a former aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. But both women (along with Liz Cheney, the Republican overseeing the inquiry) have faced vicious attacks from the far-right — with a level of vitriol and focus that far outweighs anything hurled at men. This suggests there is a level of misogyny on the far-right which is increasingly alarming, as the New York Times notes. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/23/us/politics/jan-6-hearings-women-witnesses-committee.html?searchResultPosition=1\">Read this</a> for more on the debate.</p></li>  <li><p>If you want (yet) another reason to feel nervous about the possible return of Trump, take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/07/23/donald-trump-news-schedule-f-executive-order?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top\">magnificent post</a> by Axios's Jonathan Swan about what the White House might do if Trump were to win in 2024. The issue at stake is an obscure so-called “Schedule F” provision in American law. Back in 2020, Trump decided that “this obscure legal instrument [could] empower the president to wipe out employment protections for tens of thousands of civil servants across the federal government.” It was never actually used, but if Trump wins he wants to activate Schedule F to gut the civil service and install his loyalists, Swan thinks. Yikes. </p></li>  <li><p>For a more optimistic vision of America (which we all need these days), I was cheered by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/187b8a0a-f131-4bb3-8f00-afafb6cf442a\">lovely, offbeat piece</a> by my colleague Chris Grimes on one of Los Angeles's recent achievements: the construction of a bridge. Since Gavin Newsom, the Democratic California governor, is rumoured to be considering a presidential bid in 2024, the question of whether his state can ever get anything done (or not) is becoming increasingly important. This is encouraging.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Edward Luce responds</h1> <p>Gillian, Steve Bannon's FT addiction always reminds me of Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Miners, who tried and dramatically&#xa0;failed to bring down Margaret Thatcher's government in the bitter miner's strike of 1984. This was when I was coming to political consciousness. I vividly recall a BBC Newsnight interview with Scargill, an overt communist, about the inherent anti-worker bias of the capitalist media, which included every title that was thrown at him. His interviewer (I think it was Jeremy Paxman) finally asked whether there was any newspaper Scargill would trust. He said, yes, the Financial Times because its readers have money invested and therefore could not afford to indulge in propaganda. For similar reasons, I believe the FT is read closely among the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist party. </p> <p>Bannon is a classic fanatic autodidact — as interested in the price of copper as he is in the Eurasianist ideologues whom he champions (see Aleksandr Dugin). That makes him a trove of indiscriminate information. It also means he is popular with our profession, since he is always keen to talk. Almost every kiss and tell expose of the Trump administration over the past six years has had Bannon as its principal source. I believe Bannon deserves to go to jail and will probably spend a few months inside. That will only deepen his convictions about the liberal deep state and heighten his grievance narrative. </p> <p>In answer to your question, the GOP is firmly committed to its path of plutopopulism — the unholy marriage of nativist politics and libertarian economics bankrolled by cynical billionaires. Bannon's great project during his brief White House spell was to “deconstruct the administrative state”. Whoever becomes the Republican nominee in 2024 (hint, not Mike Pence), will inherit the Schedule F agenda and put it into effect if he or she wins. That would spell the end of the US republic as we know it and Bannon would be able to read about that in detail in the Financial Times. </p> <h1>Your feedback</h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3691847-7280-4ce3-b29b-a92ec60e33a3\"><strong>Nancy Pelosi's reckless jaunt to Taiwan</strong></a><strong>': <br></strong>“Poking the dragon on a matter of existential importance to it is unwise, unnecessary and futile. This is not to say that the US and the west should not support Taiwan in all practical ways, and discourage Chinese aggression, while maintaining the ambiguous political and security formulae which have served well for over 40 years. This would be my view even if there were no Ukraine crisis.” <em>— Rory Montgomery, Dublin, Ireland</em></p> <p>*<em>CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Cassidy Hutchinson's first name.</em></p><p>Source: Gillian Tett  2022 'Bannon is already working on his comeback story' FT.com 25 July.
