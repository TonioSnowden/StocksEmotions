It's been more than a decade since Johnson left Apple to attempt to turn round department store <strong>JCPenney</strong> under the tutelage of hedge fund billionaire <strong>Bill</strong> <strong>Ackman</strong>, which turned into one of the biggest corporate flame-outs ever.</p> <p>Though JCPenney narrowly averted bankruptcy after Johnson was let go in 2013, his new idea wasn't so lucky.</p> <p>Unlike turning round an ailing department store, Johnson co-founded Enjoy in 2014 to deliver iPhones and give customers the “Apple store experience” in their own home. </p> <p>Johnson insisted that Enjoy's back-end technology, powered by “machine learning and analytics”, was its secret sauce.</p> <p>Enjoy's fleet of hundreds of mobile vans and thousands of service workers was a hint that it was a distinctly old-school business. Johnson's plan was to fill a void of personal service that ecommerce left behind, partnering with the likes of <strong>AT&amp;T </strong>and <strong>BT </strong>to “bring the full store experience through the door”.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it was an expensive one. After raising hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capital investors like <strong>Andreessen</strong> <strong>Horowitz</strong> and <strong>Kleiner</strong> <strong>Perkins</strong>, Johnson was forced to find cash far from Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Enter the <strong>Marquee Raine Acquisition Corporation</strong>, a $375mn vehicle created by merchant bank <strong>Raine</strong> <strong>Group</strong> and Chicago billionaire <strong>Joe Ricketts</strong>, whose family owns the <strong>Chicago Cubs</strong> baseball team.</p> <p>In March 2021, the Spac announced a deal to merge with Enjoy at a $1.1bn valuation, which aimed to pump about $500mn into the start-up.</p> <p>But as the deal's closing date approached in the autumn of 2021, investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7a7b073-123b-4ec9-a45a-d6df4d530f46\">began to get cold feet</a> amid a broader Spac sell-off. Just $60mn of the $375mn raised by the Marquee Raine vehicle remained after shareholders exercised their right for a refund.</p> <p>With less cash left to burn, Johnson's idea quickly went down in flames. Enjoy said in its bankruptcy filing that it ran into a perfect storm of economic and market headwinds: high redemptions by Spac investors, a supply chain crisis and labour shortages that caused it to miss financial targets.</p> <p>Enjoy has been reduced to taking out a $55mn bankruptcy loan from its likely future buyer <strong>Asurion</strong>, a privately held Tennessee-based gadget repair business that may be its new owner. </p> <p>Since trying to tap his Apple bona fides, Johnson hasn't had a smooth journey. </p> <p>He traded Apple compensation for that of JCPenney when taking over. But Apple stock soared, while JCPenney crashed. Johnson's 19.6mn Enjoy shares were supposed to be worth nearly $200mn, but now hold little value. There's also the $10mn loan he made to his company earlier this year. </p> <p>Perhaps a better career plan would have been simply to keep selling more iPhones for Apple and tethering his fortunes to the greatest consumer product in history. Trying to catch lightening in a bottle one more time seemed like tempting fate. </p> <h1>Inside the church of Bill Hwang</h1> <p>Much has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ece9e7d-a7c3-4276-9d3d-7ac47634f219\">been written</a> about <strong>Archegos Capital Management</strong>, the investment firm founded by <strong>Bill Hwang</strong> that spectacularly collapsed early last year. </p> <p>Yet we know little about the <strong>Grace and Mercy Foundation</strong>, a charity set up by Hwang that, unlike Archegos, is still going. </p> <p>The New York-based foundation, which was established in 2006, “supports the poor and oppressed”, according to a statement on its website. But, in a lawsuit filed by a former Archegos employee on Tuesday, there are allegations <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d05c97e0-4ab5-4ccf-8339-ffebbb33752d\">that the charity also played another role</a>. </p> <p><strong>Brendan Sullivan</strong>, formerly a managing director at Archegos, alleges that Hwang set up Grace and Mercy as an “escape pod” that would shelter him if the investment firm failed. He alleges that Archegos transferred shares worth hundreds of millions of dollars to a charitable foundation, which then sold them at a profit “within days”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“[Grace and Mercy] served as an alternative fund for Hwang, his family members, and ‘good followers' to fall back on and otherwise manipulate for their own benefit via self-dealing and positions provided as rewards and incentives,” the lawsuit claims. A lawyer for Hwang declined to comment.</p> <p>Sullivan is the first to allege that Hwang insulated himself financially as he pursued his frenzied buying campaign. </p> <p>The lawsuit, which extends to almost 100 pages, also provides some insight into Archegos, which until March last year was relatively unheard of on Wall Street.</p> <p>Sullivan is seeking to recover $50mn in deferred bonuses from his former employer. His complaint describes Archegos as a “personality cult” that rewarded unwavering dedication to its founder and God. </p> <p>It portrays Hwang as a man of soaring ambition. According to the lawsuit, he ran the firm as his “personal fiefdom”, with the sole purpose of becoming “the richest person in the world”.</p> <h1>The oligarchs mulling a ‘sanction-proof' mega-deal</h1> <p>We've all heard about “too big to fail”, but what about “too big to sanction”?</p> <p>That's one way to read news of merger talks between two of Russia's biggest raw material producers, Siberian mining group <strong>Norilsk Nickel </strong>and <strong>Rusal</strong>.</p> <p>A deal would create a $60bn Russian metals champion, which could help attract some state financing for expansion projects. But the synergies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4309f378-10c6-4c33-8b76-1f7bd1944afa\">seem to end there</a>, as Lex observes.</p> <p>A clearer advantage is that it will help Norilsk's billionaire boss <strong>Vladimir Potanin</strong>, who was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/681cbb78-95d5-428e-85b0-00abf2383e42\">sanctioned</a> by the UK government last week, and Rusal's founder <strong>Oleg Deripaska</strong>, who has recently been sanctioned over alleged links to the Kremlin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3af52cea-1710-4175-b236-0bebc9b51e26\">in the US</a> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66540723-08fa-439b-acaa-e74265aa0dce\">&#xa0;and the UK</a>, from a further international backlash.</p> <p>Given the jump in global aluminium prices and supply chain chaos that erupted from the US Treasury's decision to sanction Rusal in 2019, it beggars belief the west would go after a merged “Norsal” and further exacerbate already dire supply chain disruptions. </p> <p>News of the merger talks comes as somewhat of a surprise after years of public rows between the two oligarchs over issues including Norilsk's famously generous dividend policy. </p> <p>But governance spats and a lack of apparent of cost benefits that would result from a merger may now come second to weathering the geopolitical storm.</p> <p>The UK government has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-sanctions-russias-second-richest-man\">made clear</a> that its latest round of sanctions against Potanin “show that nothing and no one is off the table, including Putin's inner circle”. That circle could be getting smaller as oligarchs band together to resist sanctions.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Kevin O'Byrne</strong> is retiring as chief financial officer of<strong> J Sainsbury</strong>. He will be succeeded by the supermarket group's commercial and retail finance director <strong>Bláthnaid Bergin</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>ITV </strong>chair<strong> Sir Peter Bazalgette </strong>has been named a non-executive director of UK insurer <strong>Saga</strong>, along with entrepreneur and adviser <strong>Gemma Godfrey</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone</strong> managing director <strong>Jason Roswig</strong> is leaving the private equity firm in August to become the finance chief of gaming platform <strong>Skillz</strong>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Investec</strong> has promoted <strong>Kate Gribbon</strong>, co-head of private company fundraising, to head of financial sponsor coverage. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Out of office </strong>Rebecca Maslen-Stannage has broken through law's male-dominated top ranks to become the first female chair of law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.
