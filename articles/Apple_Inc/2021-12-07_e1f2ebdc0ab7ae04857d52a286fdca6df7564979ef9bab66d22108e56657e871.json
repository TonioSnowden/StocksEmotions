While both are self-conscious emotions, they are very different. If somebody feels shame, the focus is on them. If somebody feels guilt, the focus is on the mistake.</p><p>The most concerning consequence of shame is that the shamed are more likely to feel less loyalty to their organizations, and engage in unethical behaviors. In the cybersecurity context, this has profound implications. When people no longer feel loyal, why would they care enough to behave securely?</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>What the hackers behind the SolarWinds attack have been up to: Quite a lot, said cybersecurity company Mandiant Inc., one of the companies compromised by the same bad actors. Mandiant, which has tracked the movements of two suspected Russian hacking groups since the SolarWinds episode became public in late 2020, detailed its findings in a blog post on Monday.</p><p>The groups have targeted government offices and tech service providers, including cloud-computing companies, looking for ways to worm into customers' systems. They use complex maneuvers to hide, including blending in with the activities of typical users. Virtual private networks and Microsoft platforms are favored marks.

State lawmakers are expected to be briefed on Tuesday about the investigation. Medicaid applications, Covid-19 data and other services were unavailable as the state's technology unit worked with the health department and law enforcement to understand what happened.

Users can download their data from these sites, then upload it to Clture for cash.

Streamlytics plans to launch additional apps focused on other communities. (WSJ)</p><p>\"An unprecedented amount of value is being created by everyone's data.
