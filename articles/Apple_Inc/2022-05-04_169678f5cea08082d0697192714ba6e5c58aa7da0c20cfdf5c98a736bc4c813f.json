  "title": "'Winning Time' Is the HBO Series Magic Johnson Doesn't Want You To See; The dramatized take on the heyday of the Los Angeles Lakers has roiled some basketball legends who dispute the way they are depicted. But can fictional dramas speak to larger truths?",
  "text": "<p>Both series go searching for Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. But which one actually finds him?</p><p>Fact or fiction used to be the marker between documentaries and dramatizations designed for entertainment. But that distinction is getting closer scrutiny amid a rush of these projects, like the Michael Jordan docu-series \"The Last Dance\" or the fictionalized tennis world of \"King Richard.\"</p><p>As sports documentaries and biopics proliferate—yet another Lakers series, this one created with the team's owner, is expected this summer from Hulu—such categories are shifting. Rather than nonfiction vs. fiction, filmmakers say, the real tension now can be found between more official stories sanctioned by their subjects and heavily researched unofficial ones that attempt to capture larger truths.</p><p>\"Style does not guarantee truth—just because you elect to tell a story in one style or another, it doesn't guarantee the veracity,\" said Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Errol Morris, who is not involved in either Lakers series. \"It is so easy to efface the reality of a person, whether you're doing a documentary or a drama.\"</p><p>Sunday marks the finale of \"Winning Time,\" which HBO just renewed for a second season. Last month, Apple dropped all four episodes of \"They Call Me Magic.\" The two Lakers series deal with many of the same issues: Mr. Johnson's rise as a young NBA phenom, his NBA championship-winning rookie season, his relationship with teammate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, his sex life, his struggle between the public Magic and the private Earvin.</p><p>Mr. Johnson has said he has no intention of watching \"Winning Time.\" Former Lakers head coach Jerry West, unhappy with his own portrayal, demanded an apology and a retraction from HBO, and Mr. Abdul-Jabbar railed against the series in an extended online essay. All three participated in \"They Call Me Magic.\"</p><p>\"If you gathered the biggest gossip-mongers from the Real Housewives franchise,\" Mr. Abdul-Jabbar wrote in his Substack newsletter, \"and they collected all the rumors they heard about each other from Twitter and then played Telephone with each other, you'd have the stitched together Frankenstein's monster that is this show.\"</p><p>\"Winning Time\" showrunner and co-creator Max Borenstein said he spent three years researching the series, which is executive produced by filmmaker Adam McKay and based on Jeff Pearlman's book \"Showtime,\" a chronicle of the 1980s Lakers dynasty. Mr. Borenstein said the show uses multiple public accounts of that period from varying perspectives, including numerous memoirs and TV interviews, rather than going with one individual's point of view.</p><p>\"It's not just about the Wikipedia entry of the events,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Borenstein changed certain facts, he said, like bringing to life a key character's deceased mother, played by Sally Field, to drive home her formative impact. HBO ran disclaimers noting that this was a dramatization.</p><p>\"HBO has a long history of producing compelling content drawn from actual facts and events that are fictionalized in part for dramatic purposes,\" the company said in a statement released last week. \"'Winning Time' is not a documentary and has not been presented as such.\"</p><p>The network also defended the reporting underpinning the series, praising the \"extensive factual research and reliable sourcing\" that went into \"Winning Time\" and affirming that the company \"stands resolutely behind our talented creators and cast.\"</p><p>From the first moments of both Magic Johnson series, the drama's harder-hitting approach is clear.</p><p>\"Winning Time,\" starring newcomer Quincy Isaiah as Mr. Johnson and John C. Reilly as team owner Jerry Buss, starts with a short scene in a doctor's office where Mr. Johnson presumably has just learned of his diagnosis with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. An associate sobs. Mr. Johnson sits stunned. A mythic character has been brought crashing down to Earth.</p><p>By contrast, \"They Call Me Magic\" opens with praise from famous fans like NBA great Michael Jordan and former president Barack Obama. As it unfolds, the series presents a more polite version of Mr. Johnson's relationships on and off the court, and it dwells on his business success and good works in underserved communities.</p><p>Producers of \"They Call Me Magic,\" including Christina Francis, president of Magic Johnson Enterprises, did not respond to requests for comment. Director Rick Famuyiwa and Apple declined to comment. Attempts to reach Mr. Johnson were unsuccessful.</p><p>Screen versions of other sports figures have stirred controversy lately. Spanish tennis player Arantxa Sánchez Vicario disputed her portrayal in the Oscar-winning film \"King Richard.\" In the film about the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, Ms. Sánchez Vicario disappears for a roughly 10-minute bathroom break during a match with a 14-year-old Venus Williams. A character calls the move \"a dirty old trick,\" and sure enough it causes Ms. Williams to lose, fueling an emotional crescendo near the end of the film.</p><p>Ms. Sánchez Vicario pushed back on a Spanish radio program, calling that version of events \"totally incorrect.\" Attempts to reach Ms. Sánchez Vicario and Venus Williams were unsuccessful.</p><p>The scene was based on recollections by members of the Williams family, said director Reinaldo Marcus Green. The movie's executive producers include Venus and Serena Williams.</p><p>\"This is their biopic, so it's their version of the story and how they remembered it,\" he said.</p><p>Streaming platforms teem with sports documentaries, which raise their own sets of questions. The critically acclaimed 2020 nonfiction series \"The Last Dance,\" an ESPN and Netflix project that focused on Michael Jordan's last season with the Chicago Bulls, included in its list of executive producers two associates from Mr. Jordan's brand Jump23.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you prefer documentaries made with or without the celebrities they center? Why?</p><p>The series final cut was a joint decision involving all production partners, including Mr. Jordan's associates, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.</p><p>The presence of the Jump23 executives created what \"The Last Dance\" director Jason Hehir called false assumptions that his creative and editorial input was being undermined.</p><p>\"That's where I really bristle,\" he said. \"If you have a compliment or a problem with how Michael Jordan was portrayed, the buck stops with me. It never came from above.\"</p><p>\"We had four multibillion-dollar entities with four different agendas, each of them tapping my shoulder and saying what they thought this thing should be,\" he said, referring to Mr. Jordan's interests as well as Netflix, ESPN and the NBA.</p><p>Mr. Jordan's camp was instrumental in greasing the wheels to help the production book 105 interviews during its research, Mr. Hehir said. Attempts to reach Mr. Jordan and his business associates were unsuccessful. The NBA, Netflix and ESPN declined to comment.</p><p>Only one moment that Mr. Hehir wanted to use was not included in the film, he said, and that was because of the NBA, not Mr. Jordan. It was a scene where a high-profile Bulls player discusses wanting to hit a member of the organization with a stun gun in a moment of alpha-man hazing bravado. The NBA refused to release footage on the grounds that it was offensive, Mr. Hehir said.</p><p>Mr. Hehir said he followed an NBA executive all the way to Grand Central Station in New York pleading his case to use the video, but he did not prevail. Eventually, he moved on.</p><p>\"I had to decide which hills I was willing to die on,\" he said.</p><p>'Winning Time' Is the HBO Series Magic Johnson Doesn't Want You To See</p>",
