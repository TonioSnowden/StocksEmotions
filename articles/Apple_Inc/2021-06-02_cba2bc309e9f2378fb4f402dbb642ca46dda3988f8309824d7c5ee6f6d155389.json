  "text": "<p>HeidelbergCement plans to build the world's first carbon-neutral cement plant in Sweden by 2030 in a move to reduce the polluting cement sector's high level of emissions.</p> <p>The world's fourth largest cement producer is aiming to capture 1.8m tonnes of carbon dioxide annually produced at its Swedish plant in Slite, which would become its second large-scale carbon capture and storage facility.</p> <p>The 1.8m figure is more than four times the volume the German company intends to store underground from its first big carbon capture plant in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca86ccb9-055d-4233-909d-14edb95cbec0\">Brevik in Norway</a>, which gained final government approval late last year. </p> <p>Carbon capture, the process of capturing and storing CO2 before it reaches the atmosphere, is being promoted as a solution to reduce pollution in industries such as cement, which releases 8 per cent of global CO2 emissions. </p> <p>It is also difficult to decarbonise production of cement because about two-thirds of its emissions come from the calcination of limestone during the manufacturing process, which cannot be reduced using traditional means such as fuel substitution.</p> <p>Cement companies have many pilot carbon capture projects under way, but the two Scandinavian projects are the industry's first large-scale ones to be announced.</p> <p>However, HeidelbergCement and the Swedish government still have to reach agreement on financing before the Slite project can become reality.</p> <p>Sweden's minister for enterprise Ibrahim Baylan said the cost of the site would be three or four times that of Brevik, estimated to reach NKr3.3bn ($397m) for carbon capture, which is part of a broader NKr25bn investment that also covers transportation and storage.</p> <p>Baylan said government support was “not in the vicinity” of the two-thirds of the financing offered by Norway for the carbon capture and storage project related to Brevik, set to come online by 2024.</p> <p>“We're initially supporting the company with some funds,” he said. “In the long-run, we expect industry to make these investments for themselves.”</p> <p>Dominik von Achten, chair of the managing board of HeidelbergCement, said it was the right time to signal its willingness to ramp up its ambitions on carbon capture.</p> <p>“We have the confidence now that we can pull it off from a project management perspective and get the right balance in terms of financing from the government.”</p> <p>The Slite cement plant on the island of Gotland is Sweden's largest and pumps out about 4 per cent of the country's carbon emissions, so the project would be a significant step towards reaching its 2045 net zero target.</p> <p>The carbon dioxide will initially be stored underground in oil and gasfields, but the company has its sights set on potentially creating a new revenue stream by selling captured carbon to industries that need the gas to produce fertilisers or synthetic fuels.</p> <p>Baylan warned that industrial companies and nations would lose market share and jobs if they were slow to invest heavily in infrastructure to decarbonise energy-intensive manufacturing.&#xa0;</p> <p>“When I talk to industry, I pick up my iPhone. In 2008, who was dominant? Nokia had 40 per cent at the time. How many phones are they selling at the moment? I think this is the same. If they do miss the shift at these times, they could be off forever or for a very long time.”</p><p>Source: Harry Dempsey 2021 'HeidelbergCement aims to tackle emissions with new carbon-neutral cement plant' FT.com 2 June.
