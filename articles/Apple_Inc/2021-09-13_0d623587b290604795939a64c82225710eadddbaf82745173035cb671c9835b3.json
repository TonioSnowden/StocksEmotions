  "title": "Viacom Revamps Paramount,  Shakes Up Its Management  ----  By Joe Flint",
  "text": "<p>    ViacomCBS Inc. is revamping the operations of its Paramount Pictures movie and television production unit as part of a broader shake-up of the management there that will give television veteran David Nevins a larger role, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Under the new structure, the movie and television arms will be run as separate entities, the people said. </p><p>   Nickelodeon chief Brian Robbins will oversee films while Mr. Nevins, a longtime ViacomCBS television executive, will add oversight of the Paramount television unit. </p><p>   The realignment is expected to be unveiled as early as Monday, they said. </p><p>    The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Mr. Robbins will be tapped to succeed Jim Gianopulos as chief of Paramount Pictures. </p><p>   For Mr. Nevins, the appointment will add to a portfolio that already includes oversight of the premium cable channel Showtime and responsibility for original content for the Paramount+ streaming platform. </p><p>   Nicole Clemens, who currently oversees the Paramount TV arm, will now report to Mr. Nevins. </p><p>   Both Messrs. Robbins and Nevins will report to ViacomCBS Chief Executive Robert Bakish. </p><p>   Mr. Nevins declined to comment. Ms. Clemens couldn't be reached for comment. </p><p>   The moves inside Paramount come as ViacomCBS leadership including Chairwoman Shari Redstone and Mr. Bakish are putting a priority on Paramount+. </p><p>   The company has made several content deals for the service of late, including one with \"South Park\" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. </p><p>   As part of the new alignment, Paramount Television is expected to focus primarily on making content for its sister cable and streaming networks, the people said. </p><p>   Paramount Television currently makes shows for a range of services including Apple's TV+ platform and Netflix. </p><p>   The strategy echoes a similar approach being taken at other media companies including Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal unit. </p><p></p>",
