  "text": "<p>   You make some excellent suggestions for President Biden's next speech about the threat to democracy (\"Biden's Missing Democracy Pages,\" Review &amp; Outlook, Nov. 4). But you left out two: </p><p>   \"A Democratic Party that spends millions supporting MAGA candidates, in the belief that they will all be the easiest to defeat in the general election, will never be taken seriously when it claims that those same candidates represent an existential threat to democracy. </p><p>   \"If we truly believe that democracy is at stake in an election, then how can we insist on maximalist positions on a whole series of economic and social issues, making no concessions to entice nonprogressive voters? Allowing the Keystone pipeline seems a small price to pay for saving democracy, and it is probably good energy policy to boot.\" </p><p>   Somehow I doubt our suggestions will be accepted. </p><p>   Roger Barris </p><p>    Rancho Mirage, Calif. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Your editorial rightly suggests additional content for Mr. Biden's state-of-the-republic speech. Yet the issue remains: an election cycle in which far too many Republican officials and candidates have chosen power over principle. They raise their children to live honestly but refuse to puncture \"the Big Lie\" that former President Donald Trump invented to obscure his 2020 loss. They believe in the rule of law but support a man who directed a mob to halt the peaceful transfer of power that anchors democracy. The party that spent decades proclaiming that character matters now lives by a different mantra: Gaining and maintaining power trumps all. </p><p>   Maryellen Donnellan </p><p>    Falls Church, Va. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Before anyone expects Mr. Biden to salute Mike Pence for his \"heroic role in refusing as Vice President to stop the Electoral College count,\" members of Mr. Pence's own party should first recognize who played Mr. Pence's villain and hold him accountable. </p><p>   Christopher Huss </p><p>    Lafayette, Colo. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    In June 2020, Democratic officials abandoned the heart of Seattle to the rule of hooligans, under whose authority businesses failed, civil liberties were trampled and two teenagers were shot to death. For 24 days, the power of duly-elected officials and the rule of law was waived, while Mayor Jenny Durkan laughed off the \"block-party atmosphere\" of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The page apologizing for that particular threat to democracy evidently also slipped from Mr. Biden's briefcase. </p><p>   Ravi Moonka </p><p>    Mercer Island, Wash. </p><p></p>",
