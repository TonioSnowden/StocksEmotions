  "text": "<p>In his glowing portrait of Josiah Wedgwood — “the Steve Jobs of the 18th century” — Tristram Hunt casts an authoritative eye over 250 years of history (“Wedgwood and the shaping of Britain”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f62024f-25a8-4005-905d-cbaadd0f7022\">Life &amp; Arts</a>, August 28).</p> <p>It was history that attracted me to join the firm in 1977. After training, I was dispatched to Texas as area manager. Two centuries after the American Revolution, Josiah's Queensware, Jasperware and the bone china pioneered by his son were still selling strongly. The brand's prestige was boosted by the visit of the fourth Lord Wedgwood (Piers Weymouth) who on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the birth of his forbear, arrived at Houston's Intercontinental airport, decked out in a 10-gallon hat and cowboy boots and was met by a Rolls-Royce with a trunk-full of six-packs and his chauffeur (myself).</p> <p>But the writing was already on the walls of the New York offices of Wedgwood Inc. (USA). Senior management, driven only by sales figures, were squandering Josiah's heritage and already devaluing the Wedgwood name. Chairman Sir Arthur Bryan's acclaimed takeover of smaller potteries — Adams, Coalport, Masons Ironstone, J&amp;G Meakin, Johnson Bros and glassmaker Waterford Crystal — in the '70s led ultimately to their annihilation as brands, and to the “painful social dislocation” in Stoke-on-Trent, both noted by Hunt.</p> <p>“Business acumen” and “global mindset”, vaunted by Hunt, are not necessarily the answer. Wedgwood might have fared better if it had stayed in the family and not over-reached itself by transferring production to the Far East. After all, who knows the ultimate fate of Apple, started by Jobs? </p> <p><strong>Peter Hamilton</strong> <br><em>Much Marcle, Herefordshire, UK</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this letter:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c20aef26-8124-4376-8df1-474b6b184976\"><em>Please repair a crack in the Wedgwood story / From Dick Steele, Chairman, Portmeirion Group, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, UK</em></a></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Donning a Stetson did not stop Wedgwood's decline' FT.com 3 September.
