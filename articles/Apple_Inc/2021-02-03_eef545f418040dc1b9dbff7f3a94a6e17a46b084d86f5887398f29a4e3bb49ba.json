  "text": "<p>Langoustines have become a luxury item and chefs just have to have them on their menus, yet this high esteem is relatively recent. Chefs used to prefer lobster, freshwater crayfish and Dover sole; the Dublin Bay prawn slipped, literally and figuratively, through the net. We most often knew it by its Italian name, scampi, usually breadcrumbed and fried. While perfectly nice, such treatment hardly does the langoustine justice.</p> <p>It is best served very simply — and aspirant chefs sometimes struggle with simple. Too much elaboration and this very special crustacean loses that saline sweetness that makes it so glorious. </p> <p>Cooked when still kicking and served with good mayonnaise, a wedge of lemon and bread and butter, it is hard to beat a plate of boiled langoustines. Should you have some perfectly fresh but “resting” langoustines, a simple grilling with a little herb and spice is just the ticket.</p> <p>Now so prized, <em>Nephrops norvegicus</em>, to give it a fourth name and the one that is used commercially, had become a significant British export before this January. Yet, at the time of writing, that trade is at a virtual standstill, as delays in obtaining health certificates, customs certificates and other paperwork have slowed down the hauliers' cargo to the point of ruin. Those markets in Paris, Madrid and Barcelona have no appetite for langoustines that are three days old. No doubt these teething problems will be overcome in time, but damage has definitely been done. </p> <p>We can, of course, campaign and lobby our MPs to avoid total catastrophe but, for now, the best way to help the fishermen may be to pay the piper and eat more langoustines. Here are two recipes to give maximum returns on the investment.</p> <h2>Grilled langoustines</h2> <p>The bigger and fatter the langoustines, the better. I&#xa0;use a mat (like an oven liner) on my hotplate. Nothing will stick to it and it's slightly gentler than a griddle pan.</p> <p>To serve six</p> <ol>  <li><p>Grate the zest of the limes into a bowl — with a fine microplane, if possible — before halving and squeezing the strained juice in with the zest. Add a pinch of salt and brown sugar, the grated ginger, chopped chillies and the fish sauce. Whisk together before stirring in the oil. Leave to stand for 20 minutes. Pick the coriander leaves and chop quite finely, adding them to the sauce at the last minute.</p></li>  <li><p>Split the langoustines in half by inserting a large kitchen knife straight down into the head and then through the centre of the tail. Remove any black trail in the tail. Brush the exposed flesh with oil and place the langoustines this side down on a hot griddle (or mat, if you have one). Leave for barely a minute before turning and cooking for a couple of minutes on the shell side. Once the tails are cooked, the claws might need another minute, especially if they haven't been in contact with the grill. Serve shell-side-down and with the tails coated in the&#xa0;sauce.</p></li> </ol> <h2>Langoustine bisque</h2> <p>A recipe based on the premise that you are not so squeamish that you won't collect the shells off people's plates. Roasting, flaming and long stewing will destroy bacteria very effectively. The&#xa0;soup will freeze well, as long as you do the final touches after&#xa0;defrosting. </p> <p>To serve six</p> <ol>  <li><p>Rinse the shells briefly in cold water and then roast in a hot oven (220C) with a film of olive oil for a good 15 minutes, until they have coloured and are dry. Pour in half the brandy and give the pan a shake to ignite the alcohol. Pour in the wine and scrape up the juices in the&#xa0;tray.</p></li>  <li><p>While the langoustines are roasting, peel and chop the vegetables in small dice. Colour these in a heavy saucepan on a high heat with a little olive oil. Once nicely browned, add the tomatoes and herbs and pour in the shells and their juice. Add the rice and just enough water (or fish stock) to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook for 45&#xa0;minutes.</p></li>  <li><p>Strain the bisque in a colander placed over a bowl, pushing through as much of the juice, rice and pulp as possible. Place the soup in a blender until it's well blended. Now pass it through a fine strainer. Put the soup back on the heat and add the cream and the rest of the brandy. Taste for seasoning, using lemon juice and Tabasco as well as salt.</p></li> </ol> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
