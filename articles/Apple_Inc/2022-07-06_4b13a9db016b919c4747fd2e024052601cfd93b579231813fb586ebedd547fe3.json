Sunak, however, feared that cutting taxes could fuel inflation, which led to disagreements with the prime minister Boris Johnson. </p> <p>In his resignation letter the former chancellor said a low tax, high growth economy with world class public services “can only be responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions”.</p> <p>He went on to say that he firmly believed “the public are ready to hear” the truth about the need for tax rises and spending cuts to pay for the public borrowing during the pandemic.</p> <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg, minister for Brexit opportunities and a close ally of Johnson, insisted the cabinet changes were positive and that Zahawi's appointment would unite the government.</p> <p>The resignations of Sunak and Javid were followed by those of a series of junior ministers and aides, and increased pressure on the prime minister who will face Labour party opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer in the House of Commons today for the weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions, when he will once again be expected to answer uncomfortable inquiries over his conduct.</p> <h1>Read more</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Profile</strong> Britain's new chancellor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ea7c729-b095-4796-8f34-e8cd49ba5747\">was forced to flee Iraq</a> as a boy before founding the polling company YouGov.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Analysis</strong> Cabinet heavyweights deal Johnson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd0c01f3-787d-4f1c-abba-d592b7f3877c\">potentially fatal blow</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion</strong> This is the endgame for Boris Johnson — but it may not be quick, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9249a30-189f-4421-9b67-0ce7581928d3\">writes Robert Shrimsley</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas and here is the rest of today's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.
