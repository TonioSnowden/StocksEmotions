  "text": "<p>More on the BOJ to come.</p><p>Analysts at wealth manager Glenmede point out there's been a huge disparity between the performance of real estate investment trusts listed publicly, and those that are private.</p><p>The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Open End Diversified Core Equity Index — phew that's a mouthful — has gained 22% over the last 52 weeks, through the end of the third quarter. Compare that to the MSCI U.S. REIT BBRE, which fell 16% over the same time period. According to Glenmede, the 38% outperformance for private REITs is the strongest on record, with data going back to the late 1970s.</p><p>There's a pretty good reason for the disparity. Public REITs face nearly instantaneous pricing courtesy of the open market, whereas private REITs enjoy the luxury of a periodic appraisal process.</p><p>That sets up an opportunity, however. According to Glenmede, when public REITs underperform by at least 30%, they then outperform by an annual 13.5% over the next three years. The last time there was such an outperformance, in early 2009, public REITs more than doubled in value, whereas private REITs fell 18%.</p><p>The market</p><p>U.S. stock futures ES00 NQ00 eased after the surprise from the BOJ.
