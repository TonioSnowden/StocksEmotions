  "title": "Small  Investors  Win Big  Again  ----  By Gunjan Banerji and Alexander Osipovich",
  "text": "<p>   Many small investors are beating Wall Street pros at their own game. </p><p>   A basket of stocks favored by individuals has outperformed the broader market since March of last year, according to Vanda Research. This group, which includes behemoths like Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. alongside electric-vehicle maker NIO Inc. and digital-payments company Square Inc., has gained 68% since the beginning of March 2020 through Monday, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500's roughly 36% climb. </p><p>   And meme stocks popular with individual investors have been on a tear again. Shares of movie-theater operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. jumped 36% Thursday, continuing a string of double-digit gains that pushed them to $26.52, their highest close in four years. The recent rally in AMC shares has catapulted them above levels recorded during the initial retail-driven frenzy in GameStop Corp. and other stocks this January. On Thursday, AMC was the most actively traded stock in the U.S. market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p><p>   GameStop has advanced 46% this month, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.5%. Shares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. have nearly tripled in May. </p><p>   Short sellers who bet against GameStop, Hertz and AMC -- a group targeted by many smaller investors who have favored these stocks -- have lost almost $9 billion this year, according to data provider S3 Partners. </p><p>   \"It feels great,\" said Daniel Shin, a 35-year-old individual investor based in Edison, N.J., who bought shares of AMC in January and has added to his positions since. \"It feels like us against them. Like retail against Wall Street.\" </p><p>   This year's reversal has riveted the financial industry and fueled a surprising revival for some apparently moribund businesses, helping AMC narrowly avert bankruptcy and paving the way for GameStop to raise money by issuing shares. Those episodes were the ultimate victory for small Main Street investors who are often derided in markets as \"dumb money.\" </p><p>   Meanwhile, hedge funds -- the \"smart money\" of years past -- have continued to make a lackluster showing. From January through April, a weighted index tracking the performance after fees of about 1,300 hedge funds climbed 8.7%, according to data provider HFR. That lagged behind the S&amp;P 500, which rose 11% over the same period. </p><p>   The market's upside-down turn, featuring a sustained rally in smaller companies with shaky financials and easy fortunes made by some early buyers of these shares, doesn't make everyone happy. Analysts and portfolio managers recall that the market meltdowns of 2000 and 2008 were preceded by roaring bull markets in speculative areas such as dot-com startups and mortgage finance. When those manias ended, the broader economy paid the price. </p><p>   Millions of individual investors stampeded into the market last year, enticed by zero-commission brokerages and easy-to-use investing apps, and their interest helped fuel the post-pandemic rally. That, and the fervor with which many small investors have piled into market winners, have potentially set the stage for severe selloffs if spooked investors flee hot stocks en masse. </p><p>   That is in part because they are riding one of the most powerful forces in markets over the past year: momentum investing, or buying assets simply because the price is rising. The rising prices of assets from dogecoin, a cryptocurrency created as a joke, to Hertz shares have attracted buyers, whose demand has driven prices even higher. That, in turn, has drawn even more buyers, in part because of a behavior dubbed FOMO -- the fear of missing out. </p><p>   Data from Vanda Research show individual investors tend to pour far more money into stocks with high momentum than low momentum. </p><p>   Paktra Som, a 35-year-old pilot based in Los Angeles, said he jumped into the market for dogecoin in 2019 and has since kept buying, looking to ride its continued ascent. Dogecoin has skyrocketed more than 6500% this year despite a recent pullback. </p><p>   \"If there is a large increase in volume in something and there is a clear trend of direction that it is going . . . the result is typically rewarding as long as you know when to sell,\" Mr. Som said. \"Dogecoin had no solid fundamentals to [base] my investing strategy on. But the volume of buyers was always there.\" </p><p>   Other investors aren't tracking trading volumes or momentum. Rather, they are relying on their gut. </p><p>   \"God told me to put money into Hertz,\" said Damien Roscoe, a 42-year-old electronic technician in Glenwood, Ill. \"I know it sounds crazy.\" </p><p>   Mr. Roscoe said he made about $8,000 in profits from buying Hertz shares this spring. The car-rental company has become one of the most unlikely success stories. Hertz declared bankruptcy last year. </p><p>   Buyers had the last laugh after a bankruptcy court this month approved a winning auction bid in which Hertz stockholders would get more than $7 a share. The stock was trading at less than $1 in March. </p><p></p>",
