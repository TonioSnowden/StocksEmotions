  "title": "Two Sides  Spar Over  Theranos  Evidence  ----  By Sara Randazzo",
  "text": "<p>   Before blood-testing company Theranos Inc. collapsed, founder Elizabeth Holmes was the darling of Silicon Valley's startup world. She graced magazine covers, drew comparisons with Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, and, for a while, sat on a fortune valued at $4.5 billion. </p><p>   Now, federal prosecutors charging her with criminal fraud want jurors to hear about that wealth and adoration at a coming trial. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes and California prosecutors are sparring over what details a judge will allow into the trial in July, with fights over not only her wealth, but also testimony from Theranos patients who received inaccurate blood results and internal emails prosecutors say show the company trying to evade lab inspectors. </p><p>   In all, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila is set to weigh more than 20 dueling motions seeking clarity on what jurors can hear as both sides ready for what is expected to be a lengthy trial that has been repeatedly delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>   The U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of California in June 2018 accused Ms. Holmes and former Theranos president and chief operating officer Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani of misleading Theranos investors and patients about the company's technology, which purported to test for a variety of health conditions with a single finger prick and a few drops of blood. </p><p>   The charges followed a series of articles in The Wall Street Journal revealing that the company ran few tests on its own proprietary machines, which produced unreliable results, and instead performed most of the tests with commercial analyzers bought and sometimes altered from other companies. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani, who will face a separate trial after Ms. Holmes's concludes, have pleaded not guilty. </p><p>   The company dissolved in 2018. </p><p>   Prosecutors argued in a recent court filing that Ms. Holmes was motivated to commit the alleged crimes to keep up her wealth and fame. They mention a six-figure salary and company perks like travel on private jets, luxury hotel stays and access to multiple assistants to do her personal bidding. Her lifestyle, government lawyers say, included a luxury sport-utility vehicle and renting an expensive home. </p><p>   \"The evidence at trial will show that these benefits were meaningful to defendant, who closely monitored daily news to cultivate her image,\" prosecutors wrote. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes countered in court filings that she took a salary that was lower than those of other Theranos executives and modest in comparison with chief executives of multibillion-dollar companies. Letting in the details of her wealth and lifestyle, including her salary and stake in the company, her lawyers argued, \"invites the jury to convict Ms. Holmes based on improper emotional appeals.\" </p><p>   Prosecutors filed many other documents in court late last week, revealing details that they hope to use to build their case at trial. They include internal company communications sent before regulator inspections about limiting auditors' access to the lab. </p><p>   In one 2013 email, Ms. Holmes asks \"if the path for walking the auditors in and downstairs has been cemented so we avoid areas that cannot be accessed.\" Ms. Holmes said in a court filing that such emails have no bearing on the accuracy of Theranos's tests. </p><p>   In one email that prosecutors included in their filings, Theranos's lab director wrote in November 2014: \"I am feeling pressured to vouch for results that I cannot be confident in.\" Mr. Balwani said in an email to Ms. Holmes the next day that the lab director should be fired. He resigned a month later. </p><p>   In a text message around the same time, also included in the court filings by prosecutors, Ms. Holmes said to Mr. Balwani, \"Fundamentally we need to stop fighting fires by not creating them.\" She repeatedly said in exchanges with Mr. Balwani that she was praying for good results from the regulator inspections. </p><p>   Attorneys for Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani didn't respond to requests for comment on the emails and text messages. </p><p>   Theranos replaced its lab director with Mr. Balwani's dermatologist, who kept up his full-time practice and primarily stopped by during lab inspections, according to court filings. The dermatologist didn't have a degree or board certification in pathology or laboratory science but met federal and state requirements to be a lab director. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes is trying to keep out of court a spreadsheet of text messages the government says were sent between her and Mr. Balwani, whom she dated for a period while the two ran the company. </p><p>   She's also challenging a government motion that argues she shouldn't be able to defend herself by saying Silicon Valley startup founders frequently exaggerate or make dramatic promises to attract money, arguing the request is far too vague. </p><p>   Prosecutors also are asking the judge to allow them to introduce evidence of the real-life consequences of Theranos's alleged actions, including that the company received customer complaints that went ignored. </p><p></p>",
