  "text": "<p>Aside from the excellent efficiency and compact but smart sizing, the Niro offers seating for five passengers, dual-zone climate control, and wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay and Android Auto. It also includes an 8-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth, cruise control, roof rails, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, and more.</p><p>Learn more: What is EV, BEV, HEV, PHEV? Here's your guide to types of electric cars</p><p>So, what makes each variant different? How do you decide? Let's break each model down by price, efficiency, and unique features:</p><p>2022 Kia Niro Hybrid</p><p>Starting from $24,690, the standard 2022 Niro Hybrid model offers great value for its features. It comes with plenty of space, impressive technology, and a long warranty. Additionally, it boasts excellent gas mileage at 53 mpg city / 48 mpg highway / 50 mpg combined at the base LX trim. For the higher trims with additional features, this changes to a still-impressive 51/46/49 mpg (LXS, LXS Special Edition, and EX Premium) and 46/40/43 mpg (Touring Special Edition).</p><p>Read: 10 top hybrids for less than $30,000</p><p>If you're looking for the most affordable entry point to the Niro range — not to mention one of the most affordable ways to reach 50 mpg with a new vehicle — the standard Niro Hybrid might be the one for you.</p><p>2022 Kia Niro Plug-in Hybrid</p><p>The 2022 Kia Niro Plug-in Hybrid offers even better peak efficiency. It has a combined rating of 105 mpg-equivalent (MPGe) when the 32-kWh battery is fully charged, and 46 mpg combined when used as a standard hybrid. The plug-in hybrid can drive up to 26 miles on electricity alone.</p><p>Pricing starts from $29,590, making it an ideal fit for those with a more flexible budget. It is also eligible for up to a $4,543 federal tax credit. This plug-in hybrid gives drivers who want the ability to do some all-electric driving but who prefer the greater range and fueling flexibility when compared to an all-electric vehicle.</p><p>2022 Kia Niro EV</p><p>The 2022 Kia Niro EV ditches the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder from its hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions and uses a 201-horsepower, 291-lb-ft electric motor instead. It has a stated range of 239 miles in addition to its 112 mpg-equivalent rating. Combined with its 50-state availability and a host of high-tech cabin features, this makes the $39,990 starting price seem reasonable. This full EV is eligible for up to a $7,500 federal tax credit.</p><p>Also see: The pros and cons of electric cars</p><p>This 239-mile range puts the Kia Niro EV on par with its primary competitive set — the Hyundai Kona and Chevrolet Bolt EUV. It should be noted that in third-party testing, Kia pegs the range at 293 miles.</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com .</p><p>It's roomy, efficient, practical and comes as a hybrid, plug-in or EV: Which Kia Niro is best?</p>",
