  "text": "<p>Dissecting the stereotype of the American sitcom mom is the main objective of this strange but intriguing series. Not quite drama, not quite comedy, it's shot in two different styles — multi-camera comedy and single-camera realism — giving rise to a disconcerting tonal instability. Beyond the cultural specificity of apple pies and American football, there's a broader theme: the narrative sold to western women about fulfilment being linked to domestic harmony. As one character glumly observes: “Pretending things will change is how they sell washing machines.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Allison McRoberts (Annie Murphy) isn't even a mom, although husband Kevin, a shlumpy cable guy, is basically an outsized toddler, his blue overalls standing in for a romper suit. Their living room is a brightly lit studio set, with Kevin, his wisecracking father Pete and kidult neighbour Neil placed on sofa and chairs facing out towards an invisible audience. Tellingly, the women — Allison and Neil's long-suffering sister Patty — rarely get the chance to sit down. Life for pop-eyed, portly idiot Kevin (Eric Petersen) is a riot of beer pong and football banter, while Allison provides top ups, snacks and meals. But when the lads troop off on some hopeless wheeze or other, the lighting changes and the laughter track suddenly stops, leaving Allison consumed with fury and despair.&#xa0;</p> <p>The parody scenes are immaculate, with their splatter-gun gags, asinine stunts, and general assumption that a wife repeatedly put upon by her “loveable” spouse represents comedy gold. The two-dimensionality of the men is underlined by their imprisonment in the spoof scenario; for the moment, only Allison and Patty (Mary Hollis Inboden, impressive) appear in the real world, though they're not friends or even allies. Patty, even outside the comedy matrix, can't seem to shake off her just-one-of-the-guys persona.</p> <p>Beyond the studio lighting, the sky is overcast and the townscape dull, but even real life gets its good lines (“You look like ten miles of bad highway”). A sitcom challenge might involve providing enough meat for the chilli cook-off, while real life heads in a darker direction: resentment, alcoholism, money issues. Marcus (Justin Grace), a local garage mechanic, swiftly comes to regret his sexist overtures, and a development involving the US's tsunami of addiction to pain meds takes our downtrodden housewife to some risky places. Fish-out-of-water is another well-tested plotline. Murphy, fresh from <em>Schitt's Creek</em>, presents Allison as awkward and flawed, as she wakes from her dream of domestic perfection. As Kevin almost has the wit to point out, achieving a Pottery Barn lifestyle on a Goodwill budget still amounts to a big “so what?” </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Amazon Prime from August 27</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Suzi Feay 2021 'Kevin Can F**k Himself on Amazon Prime breaks sitcom stereotypes' FT.com 20 August.
