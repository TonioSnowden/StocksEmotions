  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>Monday marked the S&amp;P 500's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/952923b7-f421-407e-b14a-ad2ff190a134\">worst day of trading</a> since May as the liquidity crisis at the Chinese property developer <strong>Evergrande</strong> rocked global financial markets. Here's analysis from the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec1fe89c-e687-417a-bf8e-012f4825e6cc\">Instant Insight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb5aebc7-690c-47c1-8ab2-ecc92714cbe3\">Lex</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbd676b6-68e1-44f3-8e74-15c8e340e3a3\">Alphaville</a> articles on the debacle.</p> <h2>Wall Street readies for Universal's headlining act</h2> <p><strong>Vincent Bolloré</strong> isn't afraid to play the long game.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cases in point: the gruelling five-year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fdde7f3-1cdb-4ef6-ac3b-9a2eb1b7f314\">battle for control</a> of <strong>Lagardère</strong>, from which he emerged victorious <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70d96a78-819c-4f53-a1d1-6a49c983142e\">just last week</a>, or the 2005 boardroom coup at the PR group <strong>Havas</strong> that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afad0d44-4946-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb\">dragged on</a> for almost a decade.</p> <p>Now, as his sprawling media conglomerate<strong> Vivendi</strong> prepares to spin out 60 per cent of its <strong>Universal Music</strong> on Amsterdam's<strong> Euronext </strong>exchange, another one of Bolloré's long-running bets will be put to the test.</p> <p>Eight years after Vivendi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bec5c9a-efc1-11e2-a237-00144feabdc0\">rejected</a> an $8.5bn bid for Universal from Japan's <strong>SoftBank</strong> — an offer that priced the label up to $3bn higher than analysts' valuations — the plan to position the music group as its crown jewel <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/876eaa70-a6dd-4922-9457-310dd7b0d032\">appears to be paying off</a>.</p> <p>The prospectus gives Universal an indicative valuation of €33bn, but analysts believe it is worth as high as €54bn.</p> <p>Wall Street's theory is simple: the explosive growth of audio streaming has flushed Universal and its rival music labels with billions of dollars in royalties. That income will only continue to increase as platforms, including <strong>Spotify</strong> and <strong>Apple Music</strong>, grow their subscribers by the millions.</p> <p>New streaming frontiers, including the social video app <strong>TikTok</strong> and the online fitness group <strong>Peloton</strong>, which pay for the rights to use popular music, have added to the frenzy.</p> <p>And thanks to some clever dealmaking, Universal is especially poised to cash in.</p> <p>Taking after his ruthless dealmaker boss, Universal's <strong>Lucian Grainge</strong> orchestrated a bold takeover of the struggling record label <strong>EMI </strong>in 2012 that turned the industry's “Big Four” into the “Big Three”.</p> <p>Suddenly, Universal had gained a sizeable edge over its remaining rivals <strong>Sony</strong> and <strong>Warner</strong> for control of the world's most sought-after music.&#xa0;</p> <p>The group's “irreplaceable” catalogue, as described by UBS, boasts <strong>The Beatles</strong>, <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong>, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, <strong>Oliva Rodrigo</strong> and <strong>The Weeknd</strong>, whose hit “Blinding Lights” became the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2021/02/24/the-weeknds-blinding-lights-is-the-fastest-song-to-reach-2-billion-spotify-streams/?sh=7df8a006e7b3\">most streamed song on Spotify</a> last year.</p> <p>But even the best songs risk being overplayed. Almost half of Universal's music revenue comes from songs less than three years old, meaning it must stay vigilant in finding new talent. And despite Wall Street's all-in mentality, sceptics worry that valuations are at their peak. One of the key headwinds said to be facing the industry is artists striking out on their own rather than signing to a label.&#xa0;</p> <p>While the appetite for streaming may seem bottomless now, it's time to make “some magic in emerging markets”, as Grainge put it to <strong>Abel Tesfaye</strong>, aka The Weeknd, during an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae259b02-67a1-4eec-848c-7dc739efa910\">interview</a> with the FT.</p> <p>Established markets in Europe are already becoming saturated. Its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9721c936-3a24-11e7-ac89-b01cc67cfeec\">joint venture</a> with <strong>Tencent</strong> to stream its music in China is a start, but building its presence in Asia and other low to middle-income countries will be essential to Universal's longevity.</p> <h2>Greensill adds insult to injury</h2> <p>What's the only thing worse than facing billions of dollars in losses on investment products that were marketed as safe alternatives to money market funds?</p> <p>Being charged extra for the privilege of propping up the very company that caused all the pain.</p> <p>This is the perverse situation investors in <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>'s now-infamous supply-chain finance funds <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10982ce5-3c50-4e3d-8648-4a22ef92d182\">have found themselves in</a> after the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e79117f-cbf5-4765-82ca-7e8f1fb5915b\">collapse</a> of <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>.</p> <p>DD regulars will know that the Swiss bank shepherded some of its most valued clients into $10bn of investment funds linked to SoftBank-backed<strong> Greensill</strong>. While Credit Suisse marketed the funds as ultra-safe, the bank is now battling to recover billions of dollars on behalf of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/451aa60d-b35e-4a72-837d-acf8b57ece4c\">aggrieved clients</a> after the fund made high-risk loans to dubious and potentially fraudulent borrowers.</p> <p>Credit Suisse recently told investors that it expects to rack up a bill as high as $145m this year alone. And it's charging this eye-watering amount to the funds rather than eating the cost itself.</p> <p>Why the exorbitant sum? Well, partly because Credit Suisse is paying millions of dollars to keep the lights on at Greensill. While the group filed for administration and bankruptcy earlier this year, the Swiss bank fears that it won't be able to file crucial insurance claims on behalf of the funds if Greensill falls into liquidation.</p> <p>Needless to say, investors are less than thrilled.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>“It drives me nuts,” one said. “They created a flawed structure in the first place. Then had zero governance and monitoring. And now it has blown up, they are taking no responsibility and letting the investors pay for everything.”</p> <p>If that's not bad enough, Credit Suisse has privately warned investors that if the battle to recoup losses stretches into next year, substantial recovery costs would be payable again.&#xa0;</p> <p>Talk about adding insult to injury.</p> <h2>DD dines with the ‘king of Spacs'</h2> <p>It has been a while since DD readers heard from <strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f227b773-752a-4b43-b5e3-5c9777c3453a\">tech investor</a> who has a penchant for <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/13/government-should-let-airlines-fail-venture-capitalist-chamath-palihapitiya.html\">memorable</a> television appearances on the business news channel CNBC.</p> <p>Palihapitiya, a former <strong>Facebook</strong> executive, helped to turn the special purpose acquisition company into the hottest thing on Wall Street — until the controversial investment vehicles hit a wall with regulators and have struggled to maintain the same levels of investor enthusiasm.</p> <p>He hasn't announced a blank-cheque deal since January, when his <strong>Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp V </strong>announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a210a3ed-c3e3-4ed2-af50-b598dd99aaf8\">tie-up</a> with the digital lender <strong>SoFi</strong>.
