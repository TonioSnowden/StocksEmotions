  "title": "A DIY Project to Die For: Build Your Own Coffin --- Merchants offer ready-to-assemble kits for final resting place; 'so much fun'",
  "text": "<p>Guests \"tend to check it out,\" says Ms. Oceania, 52 years old, an administrator at a municipal public works department.</p><p>Visitors might not immediately grasp the versatility of the bookcase: It might look like it came from IKEA, but it will eventually be a coffin.</p><p>The shelves are designed to be removed easily, and one day the two sections of this bookcase are to be joined with hinges to serve as Ms. Oceania's final resting place.</p><p>To prepare for the inevitable, some people lay out instructions for their funerals or write their own obituaries. Then there are the other souls, including Ms. Oceania, who build their own coffins -- and use them as part of their household decor until needed.</p><p>Death \"has always intrigued me -- I don't think in a weird way,\" she says.</p><p>Advanced carpentry skills are optional. Various merchants offer coffin parts or ready-to-assemble kits to make the task easier. Northwoods Casket Co. of Beaver Dam, Wis., sells a \"Build-Your-Own-Casket Kit\" starting at $699. Jonas A. Zahn, owner of Northwoods Casket, says the company sells about five kits in a typical month. The company's website says assembly takes one to two hours, and it features a blog post: \"So You Wanna Build a Casket.\"</p><p>Buyers can add their own flourishes and creative designs. \"I've seen a lot of camouflage,\" Mr. Zahn says.</p><p>Those in the DIY-coffin camp give a range of reasons for taking matters into their own hands. Preparing for death may increase the chances of checking out in a pleasant manner. Having a burial box standing by perhaps means less trouble for the surviving family members. And it might be easier on the budget than buying a commercially made coffin.</p><p>The typical family spends $2,000 to $3,000 on a coffin, estimates Joshua Slocum, executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, which tries to protect grieving families from excessive costs.</p><p>He has advice for those who decide to build their own: \"Make sure it's sturdy enough to hold the person.\" A spill along the way to the cemetery would be awkward.</p><p>Chuck Lakin, a retired college librarian who lives in Waterville, Maine, says people often don't realize there are lower-cost alternatives to the coffins and services offered by funeral homes. As a hobby, he makes customized coffins to order. He also provides advice on how to arrange for alternatives to traditional rites.</p><p>He is a fixture at the fall Common Ground Country Fair, a large Unity, Maine, event set for September. The fair is known for lively offerings such as sheepdog demonstrations, homemade apple honey buns and fiddlers playing jigs. As he has in the past, Mr. Lakin will display one of his coffins. \"There are always people who want to have their picture taken in the coffin,\" he says. \"Thinner people have squeezed two of them in there.\"</p><p>Mr. Lakin helped Ms. Oceania build her bookcase coffin and offers coffin-making courses for others. A post for one says attendees would have a chance to build one or more coffin designs including \"the toe-pincher\" -- narrower at the feet -- and a bookcase. Also included would be talks about home funerals and green cemeteries. (\"Sounds like a fun-filled weekend to me,\" says the post.)</p><p>Mr. Lakin led one such coffin-building workshop at the All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church in Greenfield, Mass. The project required two to three hours of work and, by all accounts, was a jolly occasion.</p><p>\"We just had so much fun,\" says Joan Pillsbury, a retired nurse who lives in Gill, Mass. \"We were laughing.\"</p><p>She crawled inside her coffin to get a better angle for her power drill, and says the adventure was so absorbing that she and the other amateur carpenters forgot to eat the desserts and refreshments provided by the church.</p><p>Afterward, they helped one another load the coffins into cars and pickup trucks. Ms. Pillsbury barely wedged hers into her Subaru station wagon. She keeps her bookcase coffin in her exercise room and is satisfied when she looks at it: \"I think, that's one thing my kids won't have to do.\"</p><p>Another attendee, Donald Joralemon, 69, an emeritus professor of anthropology at Smith College, took his coffin home and added a coat of shellac to it. He put it on wood blocks in his basement.</p><p>Some might find the idea of a coffin in the basement creepy. Dr. Joralemon, who taught a course on dying and death, is at ease with it. His instructions to family members are clear: \"I want to be taken from my bed to the box and then directly to the burial site we have in our pasture.\"</p><p>Ms. Oceania, who has skulls tattooed on her calves and another tattoo reading \"memento mori\" on the back of her neck, says her decor also serves as a conversation starter and advertisement for her side vocations as a death doula, home funeral guide, hospice volunteer and public speaker on the art of dying well. She has an open mind about whether all of her remains should end up in the box she built. She has suggested to her two children that they might want to hang up her skeleton as a decoration. \"So far,\" she says, \"they aren't going for that.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
