  "text": "<p>\"We're looking forward to working together in person and to the collaboration and camaraderie that come with that,\" Mr. Cook said Friday during the company's annual shareholder meeting.</p><p>The plans come after the iPhone maker delayed return plans several times when Covid-19 infection rates spiked.</p><p>Apple's employees will be returning to the workplace more than two years after the company switched to primarily remote work early on in the pandemic. It was one of several tech companies that made the switch.</p><p>In December, Apple pushed off its return plans as the highly transmissible Omnicron variant drove newly reported Covid-19 cases in the U.S. to new heights. And in July, the company delayed plans when the Delta variant caused cases to soar.</p><p>Apple's return to the office comes as many major corporations are also once again preparing their own workplace reopenings as Covid-19 cases improve across the country and as more states and cities drop Covid restrictions.</p><p>Alphabet Inc.'s Google recently announced that its employees would return to the office starting the week of April 4. Google's U.S.-based employees will be required to work about three days in the office, the company said.</p><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and American Express Co. are also anticipating a return to the office later this month.</p><p>Apple's office reopening plans were earlier reported by Bloomberg.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com and Tim Higgins at tim.higgins@wsj.com</p><p>Apple Sets Return to Office Date for April 11</p>",
