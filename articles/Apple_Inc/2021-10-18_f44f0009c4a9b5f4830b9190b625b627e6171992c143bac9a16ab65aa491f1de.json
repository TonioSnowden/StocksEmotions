  "text": "<p>US investors shrugged off concerns about rising interest rates and a growth slowdown in China on Monday, sending Wall Street stocks higher even as markets in Europe and Asia slid.</p> <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index recovered from an early dip to close up 0.3 per cent. Technology stocks such as Facebook and Apple were the biggest drivers of the gains, gaining 3.3 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 has picked up almost 5 per cent from its recent lows hit at the start of the month, encouraged by strong corporate earnings and a Senate agreement to temporarily extend the debt ceiling.</p> <p>The bullishness in the US contrasted with stock markets elsewhere. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index, which had rallied more than 2 per cent last week, closed down 0.5 per cent.</p> <p>The UK's FTSE 100 slipped 0.4 per cent while stock markets in France, Italy and Spain fell further as investors trimmed their holdings of luxury goods businesses that benefit from Chinese demand. </p> <p>China's gross domestic product advanced just 0.2 per cent between the second and third quarters of this year, government data showed on Monday, as economic activity was curbed by the twin pressures of an energy supply shortage and a government crackdown on real estate speculation.</p> <p>Andrew Bailey, Bank of England governor, warned over the weekend that the bank would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/160e6e1a-2584-4013-8102-3ae5cfadb1d8\">“have to act”</a> to curb inflation sparked by rising energy prices and pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eab549c0-828e-44ab-8a22-b114bf2fe20f\">yield on the two-year gilt</a>, which tracks expectations of future interest rates in the UK, jumped to 0.73 per cent, its highest since May 2019. Government bond yields rise when prices fall. The two-year yield stood at 0.70 per cent later on Monday.</p> <p>The yield on the 10-year gilt rose 0.03 percentage points to 1.13 per cent. </p> <p>“Markets see high inflation, central banks with their finger on the trigger and growth slowing,” said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London. “I do think interest rates will have to go up quite quickly.” While current high levels of inflation could “ease off next year”, he added, “I am circumspect about whether we see a bull market after that”. </p> <p>Bond yields also ticked up slightly in the US, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury adding 0.02 percentage points to 1.59 per cent. </p> <p>On Wednesday the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book update on the state of the economy, which may cement expectations concerning the timing of the first US interest rate rise since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>Figures last week showed that headline consumer price increases in the US topped 5 per cent year on year for the fourth consecutive month, and minutes from the Fed's latest meeting suggested the central bank may <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c52493ff-cc51-4e69-b532-acbd0bdee8c4\">start reducing</a> its $120bn a month of pandemic-era bond purchases as soon as November. </p> <p>Joachim Klement, strategist at Liberum, said “the Fed is such a massive demand factor in bond markets” that the end of its purchases could add more than half a percentage point to the 10-year yield.</p> <p>The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six others, was flat at the end of the day in New York. </p> <p>In Asia, mainland China's CSI 300 share index closed down 1.2 per cent after the GDP data were released. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.3 per cent and the Topix in Tokyo drifted 0.2 per cent lower. </p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, touched $86 a barrel, about a three-year high, as energy traders shrugged off China's slowdown to focus on an ongoing gas shortage. It later retreated, falling 53 cents to $84.33 a barrel on the day.</p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick and Nicholas Megaw 2021 'Global stocks mixed as traders look ahead to rate rises' FT.com 18 October.
