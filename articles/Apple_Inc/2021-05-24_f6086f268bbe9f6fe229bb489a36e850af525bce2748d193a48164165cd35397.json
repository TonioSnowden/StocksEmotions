  "text": "<p>I spent much of my adult life trying to find the score. That is no longer the case, but just because we are now bombarded with every number, tally and update, from every big screen, small screen and mobile device, doesn't mean we have better outcomes.</p><p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, and my earliest memory is watching Lou Brock on television in the 1968 World Series. I spent my finest days listening to Jack Buck broadcast Cardinal games on KMOX radio, poring over every detail of the local sports page, and going to games at Busch Stadium with my brother. (The bus ride was a quarter, a bleacher ticket a buck.)</p><p>I haven't lived in St. Louis since I left for college, but my loyalty to the Cardinals and other teams from there has never waned. I've lived in a half-dozen cities and have traveled all over the country as well as abroad, so I was often left with that most vexing of questions:</p><p>What's the score?</p><p>It's easy to forget how slowly information once moved -- not in the preindustrial age but just 35 years ago. When I was graduate student at the University of Texas in the mid-1980s, I had to wait until the newspaper arrived in the morning to get the scores from the previous night. When I was a clerk at the New York Times in the late 1980s, the newsroom was computerized by then, and the Associated Press would send out its final baseball scores electronically. I'd sneak on to a computer and search the AP for the Cardinals' game. I had it timed pretty well, but extra innings were the worst -- I'd keep checking, and the score wouldn't pass until four hours or more after the first pitch.</p><p>ESPN, which launched in 1979, made my life a little bit easier. The cable channel began running, twice an hour, all scores at the bottom of the screen, and in 1995, ESPN2 introduced the 24-hour ticker. When I was walking through a restaurant or a pub and the television had on ESPN, I'd stop and wait. . .and wait. . .and wait until my score finally passed, while my party had gone on without me.</p><p>Another lifeline was KMOX, whose 50,000-watt signal can reach across America. Living in Pittsburgh and Houston in the first half of the 1990s, I would sit in my car at night (when the signal traveled farthest) and turn on KMOX. I tuned in wherever I was traveling, regardless of the crackly reception. Tom Pagnozzi, a Cardinals catcher, once struck out while I was driving a rental car in Miami.</p><p>There was also the time I was on assignment for this newspaper in the early 1990s, reporting from a cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea. My cabin had a radio, and desperate for any scores, I went to sleep one night listening to Jack Buck broadcasting a Monday night football game.</p><p>By the late 1990s, a St. Louis radio station established a toll-free number that updated baseball scores on a regular basis. Some guy just read the latest tally on a recorded line. I called so often that I could tell by the tone of his voice whether we were winning or losing.</p><p>Sometimes, you're better off not knowing the score. When I was on my honeymoon in Italy in 1997, I saw on ESPN how my college football team, the Missouri Tigers, fared against Nebraska. On the last play of the fourth quarter, a Cornhusker receiver kicked a deflected pass to a teammate for a miracle game-tying touchdown. Nebraska won in overtime.</p><p>Ruined my gelato.</p><p>The communications revolution, of course, changed everything, specifically with the iPhone in 2007 and with smartphones in general. Suddenly, the world was at your fingertips, but I was mainly interested in the scores.</p><p>In some ways, smartphones are similar to the old transistor radios that kids would sneak into school to catch the score of the World Series game (when those games were played in daylight hours). I'm told one story, perhaps apocryphal, of a rabbi who kept a transistor in a room adjacent to the pulpit, and when the High Holidays overlapped with the World Series, he told his congregants the score.</p><p>Now a smartphone means the score is in reach for everyone, everywhere. When I was reporting in Africa in 2012, the American I was with was a huge Michigan State fan. We didn't have electricity or internet in the villages, but when we were driving on the highway, my colleague could get the college basketball scores on his smartphone. March Madness in Malawi.</p><p>Our kids, ages 22 and 20, would never ask, \"What's the score?\" Because the score is right there, on their phones, scores from ESPN and Barstool Sports and Bleacher Report, flashing, beeping, buzzing, an alert with every run or goal, touchdown or 3-pointer, scores in surround sound, a tsunami of scores, all accompanied by video highlights and talking heads and statistical breakdowns and fantasy analysis.</p><p>I miss the old days.</p><p>I know, I know. I should be grateful that no one will ever again be left in the dark, but sports aren't just about the outcomes, and the outcomes should not come tumbling out of your device like loose change from a pocket. It used to be, sports were also about the loopy but passionate efforts that fans made to follow their teams. Sports were about commitment and suffering and the first thing you loved, and the search for scores in the static-filled radio broadcast, the meandering wire feeds, the lonely nights in the car, all gave meaning to our devotion.</p><p>Pity the children who were born with a supercomputer in their hand. They will never know the uncertainty, the void, the anticipation -- followed by heartbreak or jubilation -- that is the magic of fandom. Instant gratification, even in sports, or especially in sports, has its limits.</p><p>My friend tells me that I can turn on my satellite radio in the car and listen to any game in the country.</p><p>I'll wait until morning.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Hirsch is the author of 10 books, including \"Willie Mays: The Life, the Legend.\" He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</p>",
