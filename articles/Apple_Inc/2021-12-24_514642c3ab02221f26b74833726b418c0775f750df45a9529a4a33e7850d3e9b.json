  "text": "<p>And it looks so tranquil from outside. Lore has it that Led Zeppelin used to commandeer up to six floors of what is now LA's Andaz Hotel for their evening revels. Farther down Sunset Strip is Whiskey-a-Go-Go, where Oasis once worked their way through a Kilimanjaro of crystal meth that they mistook for cocaine. </p> <p>Over the road, at the storied and sometimes tragic Viper Room, Hollywood's <em>jeunesse dorée</em> would come down from the hills to feign musical talent well into the new millennium. One need not even walk as far as the Guns N' Roses-immortalised Roxy or Rainbow to grant the Strip its due as the Wall Street or Savile Row of rock.</p> <p>And, to that extent, as a kind of mausoleum. The statistics of rock's decline are aired well enough. According to the annual Nielsen report, hip-hop and R&amp;B surpassed it as the dominant genre in the US in 2017. (Later than I had guessed.) The most-streamed artists on Spotify in 2021 are solo and for the most part guitar-less. If Peter Jackson's recent Beatles film did well, it also exposed the dependence of rock on a kind of ancestor worship to remain at all talked-about.</p> <p>Explanations for the great rock 'n' roll dwindle abound, without ever wholly persuading. On the supply side, there is the supposed lack of innovation (as though Adele were Philip Glass) and, more plausibly, the financial barriers to entry. When every laptop is a viable studio, the cost of live instruments and amplifiers must baffle even a gilded teenager. </p> <p>As for the demand side of the problem, there are the vicissitudes of taste, which hold out the prospect of rock's resurgence one day, and the more structural matter of the genre's advanced age. It is hard to entice listeners in the most rebellious phase of their lives when not just their parents but their grandparents grew up with more or less the same sound. Expect an existential hip-hop crisis, then, in 2040.</p> <p>I nurse my own theory. One of Arsène Wenger's parting shots as he neared retirement was that younger football fans were taken with players, not teams. At 379m, Cristiano Ronaldo has more Instagram followers than Manchester United, Juventus and Real Madrid, his last three employers, combined. Tennis too has evolved a culture of weirdly personal identification (there are “Rafa people”) that I am not sure was so pronounced in the Sampras-Graf era. </p> <p>In civic life, as political parties weaken, there are movements of intense and sometimes disconcerting personal devotion to Donald Trump, Boris Johnson and — not even a public office holder — Greta Thunberg. Emmanuel Macron won the keys to the Elysée Palace with a personal vehicle of a party that even shared his initials. Steve Jobs and now Elon Musk have had followings independent of their corporations. At all turns, we see a public need to relate to an individual, not an institution. The trend towards boundless emotional disclosure is of a piece with it. Against solo artists, then, bands, which might even change members over time, must strike the young as jarringly impersonal.</p> <p>In the end, the cause of rock's slump matters less than the fact of it. It is bracing to witness the frailty of something that was so popular as to seem at times all but hard-wired into human nature. But then it happened to jazz too, and to poetry, which Britons of no special learning were once able to quote tracts of by heart. We might be three-quarters of the way through the serious novel's own passage into academic obscurity. All ascendant ideas, practices, businesses and even individuals should consider the plight of rock 'n' roll a <em>memento mori</em>. The difficulty of explaining it is precisely the horror. It implies that it is possible to make no glaring mistakes and still fall. </p> <p>The question is what, beyond the sound, has been lost. Rock was always a good inductor of the young into the ways of the outside world. I was on a trajectory to the meeker kind of immigrant adolescence when a raft of bands from the English north-west taught me the uses of swagger, even or especially when it is the opposite of what you feel. Perhaps Ed Sheeran or BTS serve the same pastoral role and I just can't see it. It is something to consider as night falls on what for most of the postwar era rivalled film as the central form of mass culture. Sunset, indeed.</p> <p><em>Email Janan at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&amp;tf=cm&amp;to=janan.ganesh@ft.com\"><em>janan.ganesh@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this column:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45e89d1c-24e0-419c-a020-86f410805c37\"><em>How dance music became a victim of rock 'n' roll / From Richard Farrow, London SE3, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Janan Ganesh 2021 'The great rock 'n' roll dwindle' FT.com 24 December.
