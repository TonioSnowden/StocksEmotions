  "title": "Wednesday's Markets:  Dow Drops, Stimulus View Shifts  ----  By Alexander Osipovich and Will Horner",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks held steady Wednesday after the Federal Reserve hinted that it was getting closer to curtailing its asset-purchasing program that has helped juice the U.S. economic recovery. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.82 point, or less than 0.1%, to 4400.64. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 127.59 points, or 0.4%, to 34930.93. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 102.01 points, or 0.7%, to 14762.58. </p><p>   Stocks are near highs, with all three indexes having closed at records Monday. </p><p>   Investors have bet on strong corporate earnings, the economic rebound and continued support from central banks' easy monetary policies. But their optimism has been tempered in recent days by concerns about the Delta variant of Covid-19, China's regulatory crackdown and the risk of inflation. </p><p>   As investors expected, Fed officials left their stance on monetary policy unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting. </p><p>   The Fed said in a statement that the economy has made progress toward its employment and inflation goals and that the central bank would continue to assess its stimulus programs in the coming months. </p><p>   Investors have been watching to see how soon the Fed might begin to pare back its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases. </p><p>   It has previously said the purchases would continue until there is \"substantial further progress\" on the recovery. Wednesday's statement suggested that the Fed was moving closer to winding down its bond buying, even though it continues for now. </p><p>   Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said further gains in employment would be needed before any tapering of asset purchases. </p><p>   \"We have some ground to cover on the labor market side,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Powell also stuck to the Fed's position that a recent uptick in inflation was due to transitory factors. </p><p>   \"I don't think he could have been more dovish,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, an investment-management firm. \"There's nothing that the Fed could do that would be more accommodative to the stock market.\" </p><p>   Among individual stocks, Boeing shares rallied $9.30, or 4.2%, to $231.57 after the aircraft maker reported its first quarterly profit in nearly two years. </p><p>   Pfizer shares advanced $1.35, or 3.2%, to $43.45. The drugmaker said it expects sales for its Covid-19 vaccine this year to reach about $33.5 billion, a nearly 30% increase from its forecast three months ago. </p><p>   Class A shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, climbed $83.88, or 3.2%, to a record of $2,721.88. </p><p>   The technology company said late Tuesday that its profit had surged to a record. Apple declined $1.79, or 1.2%, to $144.98 after the iPhone maker warned of a likely slowdown in growth. </p><p>   Spotify Technology tumbled $13.61, or 5.7%, to $223.32 after the music-streaming company added fewer users than expected. Starbucks shares fell $3.62, or 2.9%, to $122.41 after the coffee chain said inflation and supply-chain disruptions weakened its profit. </p><p>   Corporate earnings have generally been strong, easing concerns that the stock market is overvalued. </p><p>   Of the 195 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported results through Wednesday morning, 91% beat analysts' expectations, the highest level on record, according to Refinitiv. </p><p>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.259% from 1.235% on Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. </p><p>   In commodities, futures on Brent crude oil for September delivery ticked up 0.3% to settle at $74.74 a barrel. </p><p>   Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.7%. </p><p>   Shares of Barclays added 2% in London after the U.K. bank reported a rise in quarterly profit that surpassed analysts' expectations. </p><p>   In Hong Kong, markets clawed back part of the steep losses accumulated over the last three sessions in a selloff sparked by China's widening crackdowns on online platforms and other businesses. </p><p>   The city's benchmark Hang Seng Index added 1.5%, while its sister tech index advanced 2.8%. Some previously hard-hit technology stocks, such as Meituan and Kuaishou Technology, regained some of the ground they had lost in recent days. </p><p>   Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.4%, the Hang Seng was up 2.1% and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.9%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.2%. </p><p></p>",
