Gartner doesn't include Chromebooks in its tally, but the firm said Chromebook shipments more than tripled in the first quarter, driven by schools and other educational institutions in North America. </p><p>\n  International Data Corp., meanwhile, pegged world-wide shipments at 84 million. Similarly, Canalys said PC shipments reached 82.7 million, which it said were the highest first-quarter shipment figures since 2012 and were driven in part by backlogs on orders from 2020, particularly for notebooks. </p><p>\n  Much of the difference in the tallies from the data providers comes from how each company def </p><p>\n  Lenovo Group Ltd. was ranked as the No. 1 vendor, followed by HP Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc., which Gartner said had lost some market share. Apple Inc. and Acer Inc. rounded out the top five. </p><p>\n  -- Maria Armental </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  SIGNET JEWELERS </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Quarterly, Full-Year </p><p>\n  Guidance Is Raised </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Signet Jewelers Ltd. is raising its fiscal 2022 first quarter and full-year guidance as it said it benefited from consumer spending after receiving Covid-19 stimulus checks and tax refunds, as well as enthusiasm on the heels of vaccine rollouts. </p><p>\n  The jewelry retailer on Monday said it saw stronger-than-expected conversion and average ticket values during the first quarter. </p><p>\n  -- Dave Sebastian </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  INGERSOLL RAND </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Golf-Cart Business </p><p>\n  Sold for $1.68 Billion </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Ingersoll Rand Inc. agreed to sell its business that makes low-speed vehicles like golf carts to Platinum Equity, the latest effort by the manufacturer to shift its portfolio. </p><p>\n  Ingersoll said that the private-equity firm would acquire the unit in an all-cash transaction valued at $1.68 billion.
