  "title": "The Afghanistan Crisis:  Faster Evacuations Urged for Allies  ----  By Siobhan Hughes and Jessica Donati",
  "text": "<p>   Members of Congress ramped up pressure on the Biden administration to speed the evacuation of Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas for their service to the U.S. </p><p>   The military, foreign service and immigration systems need to cut processing restrictions that have hampered entry to the airport, expand security to enable travel to the airport, and commit to staying in the country until vulnerable Afghans -- and not just Americans -- are evacuated, said House and Senate lawmakers from both parties. </p><p>   \"I would like them to try harder,\" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa), who with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) on Thursday wrote a letter signed by 55 lawmakers calling on President Biden to implement provisions in a July law that allow Afghans to obtain Special Immigrant Visas, or SIVs, after only one year of working for the U.S. government, instead of two years. </p><p>   Such concerns got a new airing Friday, when lawmakers received unclassified briefings by telephone -- one for the House and one for the Senate -- with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. </p><p>   On the call, the officials didn't provide details on the number of people with special-immigrant-visa status who had been evacuated. Members complained that people they were trying to help had been turned away from the gates, and asked what the official Biden administration policy was on extending the withdrawal beyond Mr. Biden's Aug. 31 target date, according to people on the call. Mr. Biden has indicated he would be flexible on that deadline if more time were needed to rescue Americans, and on Friday suggested that he would treat Afghans the same way. </p><p>   But Mr. Milley told lawmakers that the U.S. was still operating with Aug. 31 as the deadline and that if military officials had more time, they would use it, and were still talking to the Taliban. </p><p>   Rep. Jason Crow (D., Colo.) said he was encouraged by Mr. Biden's remarks about Afghans, but that after listening to both the briefing and the president, he wasn't yet convinced that the U.S. was making the same level of commitment to Afghans as to Americans. </p><p>   American citizens are raising money for their own charter flights. A GoFundMe operation organized by veterans and human-rights advocates has raised over $6 million, far over the $500,000 target, to charter two evacuation flights. The group now plans to charter as many flights as possible with the extra funding and has widened its base of volunteers to assist with the effort. </p><p>   Some visa applicants have lost their passports and paperwork after they were destroyed at the U.S. Embassy by staff there to protect the applicants' identities from the Taliban. Even those with valid travel documents have been turned away at the airport, resulting in flights with some empty seats this week. </p><p>   \"The problem is still getting to the airport. It's impossible, it's so disorganized, it's such a mess,\" said one Afghan man who escaped to the U.S. on Saturday and is trying to rescue his brother who is on an evacuation list but can't reach the terminal. </p><p>   \"I am not hearing a lot of improvement in the last couple of days,\" said Rep. Crow, who served in Afghanistan as an Army ranger and who has flagged to the State Department the cases of at least 800 Afghans withSIV status. \"This is not happening at the speed at which it needs to be.\" </p><p>   On the call with senators, Mr. Blinken addressed the risks to those carrying American visas by saying that \"we're asking the Taliban to respect the visa,\" according to one person on the call. </p><p>   Behind lawmaker concerns are the mathematical calculations. With 11 days remaining until Aug. 31 and what they say is a capacity to evacuate from 5,000 to 7,000 people a day, that would still leave tens of thousands of at-risk people in Afghanistan. </p><p>   The State Department said Thursday that about 7,000 people have been evacuated since Saturday, when an increased U.S. troop presence at the airport allowed operations to ramp up. Another 6,000 have reached the terminal and have been cleared to fly. </p><p>   Reflecting the chaotic situation on the ground, State Department spokesman Ned Price was unable to say how many were Americans, embassy staff or visa applicants. The total is still just a fraction of the number of people that may need to be evacuated. </p><p>   Several lawmakers said that getting vulnerable Afghans dispersed across the country to Kabul for evacuation would require more troops to secure a broader area. That, in turn, would require changing the mission the military has been given, they said. </p><p>   Among the at-risk Afghans stuck in the processing logjam is the family of Zamzama Safi, a 25-year-old interpreter who left Afghanistan on Sunday on a commercial flight after she took the risk of carrying a physical copy of her passport, with her visa and airline ticket saved electronically on her iPhone. </p><p>   By late Friday, her sisters, brother and mother had to go home after spending almost 24 hours in line at the East gate. They made it past a second checkpoint, but their mother passed out, according to an aide to Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D., Mo.), who had helped Ms. Safi fly to Missouri. </p><p>   \"We need to fly people out, just get them out of Afghanistan, get them to a safe location, and then go through the vetting,\" said Mr. Cleaver. </p><p></p>",
