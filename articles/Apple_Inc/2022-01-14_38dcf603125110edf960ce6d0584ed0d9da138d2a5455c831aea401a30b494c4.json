  "text": "<p>Currys, the UK electricals retailer, has warned supply chain disruption is set to continue as it cut its profit forecast after product shortages and “bumpy” demand dragged down Christmas revenues.</p> <p>For the year to the end of April the company — known as Dixons Carphone until last year — expects adjusted pre-tax profit of £155m against an estimate of £160m made immediately before the peak trading period.</p> <p>Its shares fell 5 per cent in early trade on Friday, despite the launch of a planned share buyback programme.</p> <p>Group revenues in the 10 weeks ending on January 8 were down 5 per cent, worse than the 2 per cent decline reported at the half-year results just a month ago. </p> <p>In the UK and Ireland, its biggest market, sales were down 6 per cent year on year against a 4 per cent fall at the half-year stage, though that was still less than an estimated 10 per cent decline in the broader market.</p> <p>Chief executive Alex Baldock said that while sales of games consoles, virtual reality products, Apple computers and Dyson hairdryers had been strong, the company did not have as much inventory as it would have liked.</p> <p>In other areas, notably televisions, smart technology and vacuum cleaners, demand was weaker. </p> <p>Baldock struck a cautious note on the remainder of the year, saying the company was “getting ready for another year of disrupted supply”.</p> <p>He also said there were already some signs of consumers thinking twice about big ticket purchases. “What is going to happen with real wages, with discretionary income, with the housing market? What will all that do to consumer confidence?”</p> <p>Currys experienced a long period of buoyant trading during the Covid-19 pandemic as household savings piled up and consumers bought laptops and printers for homeworking and gaming equipment during lockdowns. </p> <p>It and other “pandemic winners” such as Kingfisher and Halfords are increasingly coming up against strong prior-year trading figures, however.</p> <p>Baldock said that while the company's forecasting was based around demand reverting to pre-pandemic levels, he did not expect that to be the case, citing the growth of gaming, the persistence of homeworking and more frequent product replacement as factors driving future demand.</p> <p>Sales were broadly ahead of the same period two years ago, before the pandemic began, he added. “The market was still 8 per cent bigger than two years ago.”</p> <p>Ben Hunt, an analyst at Investec, said that while the warning was “disappointing”, the downgrade was modest and that the company was still simpler and more cash generative than previously.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2022 'Supply chain problems dent Christmas trading at Currys' FT.com 14 January.
