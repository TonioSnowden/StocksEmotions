  "title": "Elon Musk sold Tesla stock worth nearly $4 billion following Twitter purchase; Musk sold nearly 20 million shares in the past three sessions, SEC filings show, as Tesla stock declined more than 11% and shares fell lower than $200 for the first time in more than a year",
  "text": "<p>Musk originally reached a deal to purchase Twitter for $44 billion in April, after buying into the company earlier in the year. Musk sought to terminate the deal in July, however, leading to a monthslong legal battle between the richest man in the world and the social network he uses regularly. barronsFacing a court-imposed deadline, Musk completed his purchase of Twitter on Oct. 28 at the agreed-upon $54.20-a-share price.</p><p>The biggest obstacle to closing the deal was seen as getting together the money that Musk had promised. That included cash from Musk as well as debt equity from banks and investments in the private entity Musk had set up to fold Twitter into, called X Holdings.</p><p>Even with all those inputs, Musk was believed to be short of the total needed, especially when considering that he would have to buy the equity of Twitter employees who had received stock as compensation. Estimates of the amount of stock Musk would have to sell ranged from $2 billion to $8 billion in recent weeks, according to reporting from Barron's, a sibling publication to MarketWatch.</p><p>Musk had already sold $31.81 billion in Tesla stock in the past year before the most recent sales, according to calculations performed by Dow Jones Market Data Group. Those sales occurred in two legs â€” one in November and December of 2021, which was thought to be for an expected large tax bill Musk would face, and another in April 2022 after the Twitter deal was announced.</p><p>After that later round of sales, Musk tweeted, \"No further TSLA sales planned after today.\"</p><p>Musk was precluded from selling Tesla stock due to a blackout from the beginning of the quarter until the EV company reported quarterly earnings. Tesla reported earnings Oct. 19, with Musk proclaiming in a subsequent conference call that Tesla could one day be worth as much as the combined market capitalizations of the two most valuable companies in the world, Apple Inc. AAPL and Saudi Arabian Oil Co. SA:2222, commonly known as Saudi Aramco.</p><p>For the year, Tesla stock has declined 45.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPXhas dropped 19.7%.</p><p>Elon Musk sold Tesla stock worth nearly $4 billion following Twitter purchase</p>",
