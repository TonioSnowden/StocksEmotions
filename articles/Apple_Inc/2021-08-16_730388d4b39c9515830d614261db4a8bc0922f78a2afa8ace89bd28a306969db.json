  "title": "Inside View:  A Chinese Warning for U.S. Tech  ----  By Andy Kessler",
  "text": "<p>   Big U.S. tech companies must be watching with glee as China cracks down on its homegrown technology companies. They are thrilled not only because they are seeing potential global competitors in e-commerce, music licensing, ride sharing, food delivery and more weakened, but because they now have a powerful card to play at home. </p><p>   It started last October when Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Financial, complained at the Shanghai Bund Summit that regulators were too cautious: \"There is no innovation in this world without risk.\" He also said Chinese banks have a pawnshop mentality, requiring collateral before they lend, unlike Ant, which was about to go public, which uses algorithms to assess creditworthiness. Mr. Ma's criticisms were correct, but he angered the powers that be. Even though shares for Ant Financial's initial public offering were 870 times oversubscribed, the Shanghai Stock Exchange effectively canceled the IPO in early November. Alibaba stock is down more than a third since then. Ouch. </p><p>   Never bite the hand that feeds you. Back when Alibaba was private, Mr. Ma benefited when Chinese regulators and the Chinese Central bank forced a spinout of their payment system, Alipay, basically taking away value from existing Alibaba shareholders, like Yahoo and SoftBank, and giving it to Chinese investors. That was a money heist. </p><p>   Killing the Ant IPO likely damaged the company's ability to raise capital. It was a dumb move given how fickle global markets are about government control. Ever wonder if capitalism and communism/authoritarianism are compatible long term? We are finding out. </p><p>   The purge continues. Food-delivery company Meituan was fined $1 billion for abusing its market position. Ride-sharing leader Didi Global was warned to delay its U.S. IPO listing over cybersecurity concerns. It went public anyway, at $14, and then the China State Council announced new rules and a probe of overseas listings. Didi stock is now under $9. </p><p>    Tencent shares plummeted after a state-owned newspaper said online gaming was \"opium for the mind.\" So maybe children should be tutored instead? Well, new restrictions on after-school tutoring hammered New Oriental Education &amp; Tech Group's stock, down 89% from its peak. </p><p>   Overall, more than $1 trillion in value has disappeared since Mr. Ma's pawnshop comment. That is almost 10% of the entire Chinese stock market capitalization. This seriously damages access to capital for Chinese companies as foreign investors turn cautious. These are self-inflicted wounds to the Chinese economy to grab power. Why now? I suspect the Chinese Communist Party wants to control the data of its citizens before it is too late. </p><p>   American Big Tech companies are grinning because now they have the perfect card to play as their own antitrust noose tightens: They can claim U.S. regulators are acting like the Chinese Communist Party. And they'd be right. </p><p>   President Biden appointed three tech-hating progressive pillars of piety to prominent government positions: Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission, who wants to break up Amazon; Tim Wu at the National Economic Council, who has a book denouncing bigness; and Justice Department antitrust nominee Jonathan Kanter, who has represented Yelp and Microsoft accusing Google of anticompetitive behavior. I don't think even the Communist Party could stack the deck so well. </p><p>   As in China, bigness is bad only if it threatens government control, though the feds conveniently ignore the big sectors they already control like education, healthcare, the post office and others. The appointment of these three government-knows-better types is a blatant power grab. Government seems to be saying to Big Tech: \"Do our bidding.\" \"Censor our critics.\" \"Track our citizens.\" </p><p>   A crackdown is coming -- Big Tech needs to act pre-emptively to cut regulators off at the pass. The only real way to do this is through transparency of their inner workings. This will slow the regulatory rush, and, in the end, be good for business. </p><p>    Apple should quickly restructure its app store, stop charging bloated fees in the name of privacy and security, and allow outside payment systems. If it doesn't, it is inviting regulators' wrath. Legislation was recently introduced in the Senate to force Apple's hand. Amazon and Google should stop favoring their own products and services in search results. Or if they do, have some transparent system and scoring to explain why and always offer easy links to alternate, nonfavored results. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube need to create clear policies on takedowns. If a post or video is censored or an account suspended, explain exactly why. </p><p>   The opaque days are over. American tech companies need to shred the Communist Party playbook, showing that being open and transparent is democratic compared with authoritarian, big-is-bad Chinese-style antitrust. That is a powerful argument. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Write to kessler@wsj.com </p><p></p>",
