  "title": "The 7 Companies That Do It All Well in the Rankings of Best-Managed Companies; Only seven companies this year were All-Stars in the Management Top 250 ranking. And only one company has been an All-Star since we started the rankings in 2017.",
  "text": "<p>explore the management top 250</p><p>* Microsoft Tops the Best-Managed Companies of 2022</p><p>* How Did Your Company Do?</p><p>Of the 902 companies that we analyzed this year, a mere seven of them scored 60 or higher, on our 0-100 scale, in every category of performance that we examined: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength.</p><p>The seven firms—Accenture PLC, Apple Inc., HP Inc., Mastercard Inc., Pfizer Inc., Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Visa Inc. —have been designated as All-Stars in recognition of their excellence in all five phases of their business.</p><p>Our statistical model, which relies on 34 different metrics, is anchored in the core teachings of Mr. Drucker, the late management scholar. It forms the basis for the Management Top 250, a ranking produced annually with The Wall Street Journal. We define effectiveness as Mr. Drucker did: \"doing the right things well.\"</p><p>At the mean</p><p>A company that scores a 50 is right at the mean, or the average, of all the corporations we evaluate. A 60 is one standard deviation above the mean, landing a company in the top 15% to 20% of our total universe of firms.</p><p>It is not unusual for companies to earn a 60 in one or more areas. Even Ubiquiti Inc., a technology company that tied for last place overall on our list for 2022, rang up a 63.5 in financial strength. Seventy-one companies scored a 60 or higher in three or more categories.</p><p>But this year, as in years past, those scoring at least a 60 in every area were few and far between. The company ranked No. 1 on our list overall for 2022, Microsoft Corp., falls short of being an All-Star because of a 48.6 in customer satisfaction.</p><p>\"It's a very difficult thing to pull all of these elements together into a truly effective business system,\" says Darrell Rigby, a partner at Bain &amp; Co. Although it has become increasingly common for companies to talk about serving all of their stakeholders, he adds, \"very few have actually developed a strategy for how to do it.\"</p><p>Judging by our All-Stars, there are a few good places to start.</p><p>A North Star</p><p>One is to find a single area to home in on while never losing sight of the rest. At Mastercard, for example, \"if there's an overwhelming dynamic, it's putting the customer at the center,\" says Michael Froman, the financial-services company's vice chairman and president of strategic growth. \"It's a good North Star for us.\"</p><p>One group that Mastercard has been trying to reach are those who have been excluded from the financial system. In 2020, the company extended an earlier pledge and said it would help to bring one billion people, as well as 50 million micro and small businesses, into the world of the digital economy through a network of private and nonprofit partners.</p><p>Mr. Froman says this kind of commitment not only provides Mastercard with new moneymaking opportunities but also promises to have a large social impact. In turn, that helps to spur innovation from employees who feel highly motivated. \"They don't have to separate their work life from their purpose-driven life,\" Mr. Froman says.</p><p>In the end, he says, all of these dimensions \"are interrelated.\"</p><p>Focusing on patients</p><p>Likewise, Pfizer's primary aim \"is to be patient-centric,\" says Chief Executive Albert Bourla. This focal point, he says, helped the company realize \"two scientific wins amid the biggest health scare in a century\"—a vaccine to protect against severe disease and hospitalization from Covid-19 (developed with BioNTech SE) and the antiviral pill Paxlovid to treat it.</p><p>That accomplishment \"raises the bar for innovation\" going forward, Mr. Bourla says. At the same time, it has inspired employees to be even more engaged and productive and has helped to enhance Pfizer's reputation with the general public. \"Many felt we conducted ourselves in a very socially responsible way,\" he says.</p><p>Both Mastercard and Pfizer stress that firing on all cylinders isn't easy. It requires constant monitoring and measuring—and holding people accountable.</p><p>At Mastercard, an annual bonus available to all 28,000 employees rises or falls depending on whether the company meets numerical targets related to its financial-inclusion efforts, environmental sustainability and gender equity on pay. \"It's very quantitative and very transparent to everybody,\" Mr. Froman says.</p><p>At Pfizer, there is a similar emphasis on making data-driven decisions. In 2019, when Mr. Bourla became CEO, he laid out a clear purpose—\"breakthroughs that change patients' lives\"—and an accompanying blueprint with five strategic imperatives. Among these was doubling the company's innovation success rate, which it has achieved. \"It is very specific and very measurable,\" Mr. Bourla says.</p><p>Six-time winner</p><p>The only thing rarer than doing well in every category is doing it over and over again. Just one company—P&amp;G—has been an All-Star six times, scoring a 60 or higher in every component of our model every year since 2017, when our rankings were first published. Apple has been an All-Star five times. No other company has pulled off this feat more than three times.</p><p>\"In the ever more complex world we live in, we must balance the needs of an increasing number of constituents—including consumers, employees and shareowners—to continue to drive balanced growth and value creation,\" says Jon Moeller, P&amp;G's CEO.</p><p>Much of what propels P&amp;G runs deep in the company's culture. A.G. Lafley, who served twice as CEO—from 2000 to 2010 and from 2013 to 2015—says that, as he sees it, the consumer-products giant's \"big advantage\" is that \"we think very long term.\"</p><p>The times that P&amp;G has stumbled, in his view, are when it has become preoccupied with immediate financial returns and has tried to \"hit it out of the park in the short term.\"</p><p>As with Mastercard and Pfizer, P&amp;G's main focus is the customer. That orientation, Mr. Lafley says, has fostered over the years a tremendous amount of innovation, including seeking to satisfy consumer demands for more environmentally friendly products such as concentrated laundry detergent and recyclable and reusable packaging.</p><p>It's a mind-set that also carries over into the way that P&amp;G treats its employees. \"When we're really doing it right,\" Mr. Lafley says, the company is routinely digging into and meeting the needs of its employees \"just like with our customers.\" P&amp;G has long valued diversity, equity and inclusion because a workforce made up of people from a variety of backgrounds can provide crucial insights into what different customers are likely to want out of P&amp;G's brands. \"It's very pragmatic,\" Mr. Lafley says.</p><p>Although it begins with the customer, in the end it's the \"balance of efforts,\" as Mr. Drucker described it, that has helped P&amp;G to be so consistent across the board. \"Achieving that balance is no small task,\" says Mr. Moeller, P&amp;G's current CEO, \"but it's necessary—and a challenge we continue to embrace.\"</p><p>Mr. Wartzman is head of the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society, part of the Drucker Institute, and Ms. Tang is the institute's senior director of research.
