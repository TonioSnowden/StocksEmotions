  "text": "<p>I was starring on TV's \"One Day at a Time,\" so I had money to buy the car. I couldn't wait to drive. The car meant freedom. But I was 15½, so it mostly sat in the garage until I turned 16. During that period, freedom came with my dad in the passenger seat.</p><p>My family first lived in Claymont, Del., until I was 8. Then we moved to Clarkston, Mich. When I was 11, we settled in Los Angeles. My father, Andrew, was an executive at General Motors, where he oversaw construction of their new production facilities.</p><p>In L.A., we lived in a white two-story house in Porter Ranch in the San Fernando Valley. I played football with my three older brothers—Drew, David and Patrick—and tag in the front yard and on the street. It was a typical suburban upbringing, with great weather.</p><p>My mom, Nancy, was a homemaker. She worked hard. I don't know how she did it all with three boys and a girl. This was before the microwave oven. The kitchen was her office.</p><p>My mother and I weren't as close as we could have been. I would see my girlfriends and their mothers and wish we were that close. They would tell their mothers everything. I told my mom nothing. I wasn't secretive. I just didn't want to risk making waves. I was trying to hold on to what I could control and ensure I didn't disappoint her.</p><p>I think this dynamic started when my mom was pregnant with me and lost my brother, Mark. He had wandered into a friend's barn and accidentally drank poison out of a soda bottle. She was grieving when she gave birth to me.</p><p>My parents always told me I was the best little girl. I never cried and never did anything to set anyone off. I knew intuitively that I needed to be the good one. I didn't want to upset my parents and make them cry.</p><p>I also wanted everybody to be happy. As I grew older, my dad instilled in me that everybody must like you. He was the happy guy, and everybody liked Andy. But he also had a nasty side.</p><p>Because I was the only girl, I had a room to myself where I was in my own world. I loved to read and listen to music. I didn't go to a lot of movies, but I did love TV, especially those '70s sitcoms and Christmas specials. But I didn't know how to make people like me. I only had a few friends, and I wasn't good at small talk.</p><p>At school, I was super-duper shy. Then, in sixth grade, I met a girl who was in TV commercials. I wanted to do that, too. She was so popular. I thought being in ads would help me be more outgoing.</p><p>My mom saw an ad for the Tami Lynn School of Artists. She thought it would be fun and asked if I wanted to try it out. I did.</p><p>But because you had to say tongue twisters and do all these acting exercises, it embarrassed me. I was so uncomfortable at first—even when I landed a TV ad for JC Penney at age 12.</p><p>Soon after, I appeared in an episode of \"Apple's Way,\" a mid-'70s TV drama series. Next, I auditioned for dozens of commercials but would be passed over by many before landing one. I foolishly took the rejection personally.</p><p>See More House Call Columns</p><p>* 'Don't Look Up' Actor Ron Perlman's Childhood Superhero Was Quasimodo</p><p>* 'Stay Close' Actor Richard Armitage Was Named for a Monarch, Later Praised by a Royal</p><p>* How Hayley Mills Avoided Her Own 'Parent Trap'</p><p>* 'And Just Like That…' Actress Kristin Davis Went From Wallflower to Hippie Theater Kid</p><p>For \"One Day at a Time,\" thousands of girls auditioned. I had three or four callbacks before reading for the show's creator, Norman Lear. Landing the Barbara Cooper role erased a lot of years of rejection.</p><p>About several episodes in, Norman said he wanted to set me up with a really good acting coach. Of course, I took it as \"I'm terrible, he wants to fire me.\" But the coaching was a great experience.</p><p>Today, I live in a comfortable, rambling ranch house in Studio City in L.A. We have a beautiful live oak in the backyard, and I love my library and my burgundy armchair and ottoman.</p><p>One of my favorite dishes is my paternal grandmother's cappelletti in brodo—a soup with small meat-filled pasta bonnets. My Nonnie lived near us in Delaware when I was little.</p><p>Aunt Adeline inherited the recipe and taught me to make it from scratch. The soup is a complete meal and has always been my comfort food. I hear my entire family whenever I eat it.</p><p>Not Nonnie's, but Fast</p><p>How fast? About 10 minutes. I usually make cappelletti in brodo from scratch, but this is a quick version if you don't have time:</p><p>1 large carrot, diced</p><p>3-4 cups of chicken or beef broth (depending on how brothy you like it)</p><p>1 9-oz. package of refrigerated meat or cheese tortellini (such as Buitoni)</p><p>Pour broth and diced carrots into a soup pot and bring to a gentle boil. Add tortellini and reduce heat. When pasta is cooked through, ladle into bowl and sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Makes 3-4 servings.</p><p>Actress Valerie Bertinelli Grew Up 'Super-Duper Shy'</p>",
