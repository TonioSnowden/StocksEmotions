  "title": "Apple and Amazon's Physical Footprints Become Weakness in Shortage Economy; Component and labor shortages add to shipping delays to weigh down outlook for tech giants",
  "text": "<p>Big tech peers Microsoft, Google and Facebook get most of their business through software, cloud services and online advertising. But Apple and Amazon—which now generate a combined $833 billion in annual revenue—still depend primarily on getting physical goods into the hands of customers. About 81% of Apple's revenue for its fiscal year that ended in September came from devices made mostly in China and shipped around the world. Amazon, meanwhile, gets about three-quarters of its total revenue through online and physical stores, plus the commissions it gets from third-party sales.</p><p>This leaves both highly exposed to the pressures of labor and component shortages, plus the growing backlog in global shipping. Amazon's chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said the company is absorbing most of the added costs itself; operating income fell 22% from a year earlier to $4.9 billion in the third quarter. Apple's operating earnings jumped 61% to about $23.8 billion, but the company benefited from an easy comparison given the delayed launch of last year's new iPhone models. Apple's operating margin has ticked down from nearly 31% two quarters ago to 28.5% in the most recent period. The company says supply constraints cost it about $6 billion in the September quarter, and Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on Thursday's call that the number will likely be higher in the December period.</p><p>The pain is likely to be temporary for both. Apple's products command a high degree of loyalty from its customers, and Mr. Cook says demand is \"robust\" for the latest devices that include the iPhone 13 lineup. Meanwhile Amazon's commanding position in retail and e-commerce makes it hard to skip over, particularly with its Prime membership program. Prime members now make up about 65% of all of Amazon's customers in the U.S., estimates Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Still, while the two managed well early in the pandemic, their scale and business exposure means they can't avoid the world's problems forever.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Apple and Amazon's Physical Footprints Become Weakness in Shortage Economy</p>",
