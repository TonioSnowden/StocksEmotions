  "title": "Stocks Rise, Buoyed by Apple Earnings; Major indexes post gains at end of wild trading week",
  "text": "<p>Major stock indexes have had a roller coaster week. Despite Friday's gains, the broad S&amp;P 500 remains on track to fall for a fourth consecutive week as the Federal Reserve has rattled markets by moving toward raising interest rates.</p><p>Some upbeat big-name corporate earnings reports cheered investors. Shares of Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalization, rallied 5.8% a day after the iPhone maker posted record revenue and profits. Other big tech stocks also rose, with Alphabet advancing about 2% and Microsoft up 1.3%.</p><p>\"Apple was the savior yesterday for the whole market,\" said Louis Ricci, head trader of Emles Advisors, an investment-management firm.</p><p>Visa jumped 8.3% on Friday after beating analysts' forecasts for profits and sales, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Among the day's underperformers, Chevron slid 4.5% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that were lower than expected, even as surging commodity prices lifted the oil producer to its most profitable year since 2014. Caterpillar tumbled 5.3% after the equipment maker reported a surge in costs that offset a jump in revenue.</p><p>Shares of Robinhood Markets rebounded from a loss of more than 10% after the opening bell and were recently up about 7%. The brokerage popular with small investors reported a larger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Stocks have slumped since the beginning of January as the Fed has moved to raise interest rates to combat surging inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments Wednesday added to expectations that the central bank will start a series of rate increases in March. Low rates during the pandemic helped fuel a huge rally in stocks and other risky assets.</p><p>\"Cheap money is like a comfort blanket for investors and for markets,\" said Jane Foley, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank. \"Almost inevitably, you start to withdraw some of that cheap money and you're going to have more volatility in the markets.\"</p><p>Government data released Friday showed the upward pressure on prices that has worried policy makers. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal-consumption expenditures price index, rose at 4.9% in December over the prior year.</p><p>A separate measure showed employers spent 4% more on wages and benefits last year—an increase not seen since 2001—as a tight labor market encouraged workers to demand higher pay. Still, employment costs didn't rise as much in the fourth quarter as economists anticipated, easing concerns that the U.S. economy is heading for a \"wage-price spiral.\" In such a scenario, salary hike and price increases become mutually reinforcing, fueling inflation.</p><p>Meanwhile, new Commerce Department data showed consumer spending fell last month amid rising prices and the fallout from the Omicron wave of Covid-19. Some data suggests that the highly contagious variant has peaked in densely populated parts of the U.S., while continuing to surge elsewhere.</p><p>Inflation concerns have filtered into this week's corporate earnings reports. Mondelez International said late Thursday that it would likely raise prices further this year. Its shares fell 2.6% on Friday after the global food giant said its profitability was being squeezed by rising ingredient and transportation costs.</p><p>Corporate earnings have generally been solid. Almost a third of the companies on the S&amp;P 500 have reported fourth-quarter results, and 78% of them have beaten analysts' estimates for earnings per share, according to FactSet.</p><p>In commodities, U.S. natural-gas futures shot up 12% to $4.81 per million British thermal units as a snowstorm threatened to hit the East Coast this weekend and forecasters said February would be colder than anticipated, driving up expected demand for the heating fuel.</p><p>Investors bought government bonds on Friday, pushing down yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 1.787% from 1.807% on Thursday. Bond yields move in the opposite direction from prices.</p><p>European markets dropped, with the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 falling 1%.</p><p>Asian markets were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.1%, while the Shanghai Composite Index was down about 1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 2.1%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise, Buoyed by Apple Earnings</p>",
