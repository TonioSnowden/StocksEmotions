  "title": "Is Will Smith's Apology Tour Working? The star aims for a comeback with the film 'Emancipation,' which arrives in theaters this weekend. Crisis P.R. executives weigh in.",
  "text": "<p>\"The P.R. campaign surrounding 'Emancipation' is obviously fully conceived and constructed for Smith to be brought back into the good graces of audiences, more so than advertising the film itself,\" said Jeff Bock, senior media analyst at the entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations.</p><p>This week, Mr. Smith told Trevor Noah on \"The Daily Show\" that at the time of the slap, he was dealing with an undisclosed personal issue. \"I lost it,\" he said. \"Hurt people hurt people.\" The actor also told Fox 5 DC that he understands if some people don't want to see the film. \"If someone is not ready, I would absolutely respect that and allow them their space to not be ready,\" he said.</p><p>Howard Bragman, who heads the crisis management P.R. firm La Brea Media and has worked with movie stars as well as public figures like Anthony Scaramucci and Monica Lewinsky, said Mr. Smith has apologized enough and any more discussion takes away from \"Emancipation.\"</p><p>\"I just wish Will would quit going on his apology tour,\" he said. \"It's just like, 'Shut up already, we're tired of this thing.' Let's talk about the film—it's an important story that needs to be told.\"</p><p>Mr. Smith and his publicist declined to comment.</p><p>At the Academy Awards,Mr. Smith bounded to the stage and slapped Mr. Rock after the comedian joked about Mr. Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Less than an hour later, Mr. Smith won the best actor Oscar for his performance as Richard Williams, the father of Venus and Serena Williams, in \"King Richard.\" In his acceptance speech, he did not apologize to Mr. Rock.</p><p>Controversy erupted as Mr. Smith partied that night with Oscar in hand. His Instagram apology to Mr. Rock the next day did little to stop the firestorm. Days later, he resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which oversees the Oscars. The Academy banned Mr. Smith from the ceremony for 10 years, though he can still be nominated for awards. Over the summer, Mr. Smith returned with a deeper video apology to Mr. Rock.</p><p>Mr. Smith's contrite interviews accompanying the \"Emancipation\" debut could help the film this awards season, said LaToya Evans, a crisis communications expert who heads the LEPR Agency and has worked with the family of George Floyd as well as several Democratic presidential campaigns. \"I think it will generate good buzz for the Oscars,\" she said. \"People want that human connection.\"</p><p>The movie star has called \"Emancipation\" a film about freedom. The film from director Antoine Fuqua, unsparing in its depiction of slavery's violence, is inspired by the true story of a Black man's grueling escape through the swamps of Louisiana after President Lincoln declared slaves free. When the man known as Gordon or Peter joined the Union Army, he posed for a photograph that exposed his deeply scarred back disfigured by slave masters' whipping—an image that is referred to as \"Whipped Peter\" or \"The Scourged Back.\" It was the first viral picture to show the world the inhumanity of slavery, and it drew white northerners to the abolitionist cause.</p><p>So far, the full trailer for \"Emancipation\" is polling nearly as well with entertainment consumers as the prerelease trailer for last year's Mr. Smith vehicle \"King Richard,\" according to entertainment researcher Enact Insight. Audience-anticipation scores among entertainment consumers are higher for \"Emancipation\" than for several other high-profile upcoming films, outpacing the full trailer for the Tom Hanks film \"A Man Called Otto\" and the teaser trailer for the Brad Pitt-Margot Robbie vehicle \"Babylon,\" according to the company.</p><p>\"We're seeing a lot of signals that the creative materials are effective, the concept is compelling and the involvement of Will Smith is not a major deterrent, which bodes well for its ability to cross over with broader audiences,\" said Chris Liberge, president of Enact Insight.</p><p>Apple Original Films, which earlier this year picked up the streaming world's first best picture Oscar with the family drama \"CODA,\" faces heightened expectations as awards season approaches. So far, film reviews for \"Emancipation\" have been mixed. But there is also outspoken support for the movie. A recent opinion column in Variety read: \"Slap or No Slap—'Emancipation' Is an Oscar Contender for Will Smith and Antoine Fuqua.\" After seeing the film, NAACP president Derrick Johnson wrote on Twitter: \"[I] ​​can't begin to tell how powerful this is for OUR community and OUR history.\"</p><p>Apple chose not to delay the release of \"Emancipation\" after the Oscars controversy and instead is making it Oscars-eligible with this year's late theatrical release. The concerted publicity effort for \"Emancipation,\" which was one of the most popular titles at a virtual market held by the Cannes Film Festival in 2020 thanks to Mr. Smith's star power, aims to make good on Apple's investment in the film. The Journal has reported that figure at $100 million.</p><p>Crisis P.R. consultant Matthew Hiltzik, whose clients have included Johnny Depp and Jason Sudeikis, applauded Mr. Smith and his P.R. advisers for a well coordinated plan to ingratiate the actor after his fall from grace, though he said it's still too early to determine how audiences will react. \"He and his team have done a masterful job with the rollout, the messaging has been consistent, they've found ways to focus on the important subject matter of the film, and they've made it about the broader community interests and not about him,\" said Mr. Hiltzik, chief executive of Hiltzik Strategies. \"But this is about more than a film, so only time will tell.\"</p><p>Evan Nierman, who heads the crisis communications firm Red Banyan and represents celebrities, politicians and other national figures, also offered praise for aspects of the campaign. \"Will Smith out there now having his face on camera is all a wise decision,\" he said.</p><p>Still, he wishes Mr. Smith had directly addressed Mr. Rock in the \"Daily Show\" interview. \"Saying 'I just lost it' is not an adequate mea culpa for what he did,\" he said. \"I think that a succinct, powerful and memorable apology directly to Chris Rock would put this controversy to bed.\"</p><p>Many fans say they're eager to support the film.</p><p>\"I for one am never going to judge someone who has an outstanding career and probably made the biggest mistake of his life,\" said Britt Howell, a Minneapolis community activist who has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Smith on Twitter. \"That's not going to deter me from seeing a movie almost a year later.\"</p><p>Write to Ellen Gamerman at ellen.gamerman@wsj.com</p><p>MORE IN FILM</p><p>* In 'Glass Onion,' an Art Collection That Says 'Rich Jerk'</p><p>* How Will Ferrell Became the King of Christmas</p><p>* Now in a Theater Near You: Cannibalism, Vomit and Severed Fingers</p><p>* Candace Cameron Bure Wants to Put Christianity Back in Christmas Movies</p><p>* How 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' Fans Plan to Mourn Chadwick Boseman at the Movies</p><p>Is Will Smith's Apology Tour Working?</p>",
