  "text": "<p>Elizabeth Holmes, the 37-year-old founder of failed blood testing start-up Theranos, is facing decades in prison after being found guilty by a jury in California of conspiring to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bde19f6-e8a5-4800-8882-fd799f0caac0\">defraud her investors</a>. </p> <p>In one of Silicon Valley's most high-profile criminal fraud cases, the jury convicted Holmes of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. </p> <p>It found her not guilty on four further counts relating to defrauding patients. The jurors failed to reach a verdict on three remaining charges relating to investors. Holmes can appeal her conviction in the federal appeals court. </p> <p>The end of the 15-week trial was a landmark moment for Silicon Valley, where Holmes' chutzpah had been widely celebrated after she raised nearly a billion dollars to chase the dream of diagnosing health conditions from a few drops of blood.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
