  "title": "Arts in Review -- Theater Review: Basquiat and Warhol Face Off --- The icons debate their differing artistic visions",
  "text": "<p>New York -- For many stretches of its length, \"The Collaboration,\" a play by Anthony McCarten about the gestation of a 1985 gallery show of paintings created together by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, feels like a dissertation in dialogue. Mr. McCarten has closely studied his subjects, and brings them to sometimes stiff and speechy but mostly convincing life, with admirable help from the two excellent actors who portray the artists, Paul Bettany as Warhol and Jeremy Pope as Basquiat, who played the roles at its premiere at the Young Vic in London and will be seen in the movie version of the play.</p><p>Yet only in its later stages does the play, presented on Broadway at Manhattan Theatre Club's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, achieve much dramatic momentum. Even then it is fairly modest. I wouldn't say the play has the static quality of a painting of a Campbell's soup can, but for wearying passages it is often close.</p><p>Warhol is obviously a more celebrated figure than Basquiat, and anyone familiar with Warhol will learn nothing new from \"The Collaboration,\" in which the characters offer extended spurts of exposition, about their lives, their work, their aesthetics and ideologies, smoothly if not wholly convincingly disguised as natural conversation. (A small portion of Warhol's dialogue is actual quotations.)</p><p>Mr. McCarten, who wrote the book for the Neil Diamond musical \"A Beautiful Noise,\" views art through the lens of personal history and psychology. \"The Collaboration\" includes long passages, often repetitive, wherein Warhol and Basquiat discuss their vigorously different views of art, and the wellsprings of the psyche from which they derive. When Basquiat demands to know why Warhol doesn't paint anymore, Warhol counters that his other pursuits are better at distracting him from \"a lifelong loathing of himself.\"</p><p>The give and take between the two is sometimes amusingly contentious but rarely surprising; too often they sound like skilled debate students taking up contrarian positions. Warhol was by this point and by his own cranky admission a somewhat derided figure as an artist but a worldwide celebrity -- he can't resist a florid bit of name-dropping, including a reference to (go figure) a young Steve Jobs. Basquiat, by contrast, was an up-and-coming former graffiti artist. Their exchanges circle repeatedly around their different opinions of art's purpose and value.</p><p>Basquiat: Art has to have \"some kind of function, a purpose.\" Warhol blandly retorts: \"I disagree with that. Why can't it just be about nothing . . . for nobodies?\" Warhol hasn't picked up a brush in 25 years, and by now his medium is film, if not just fame; Basquiat is exuberant in his use of paint and repeatedly scolds Warhol not to view paintbrushes as if they were cockroaches.</p><p>Mr. Bettany has the tougher role, since Warhol created a familiar public persona apart from his work, a deliberate attempt to insulate himself from slings and arrows. (He insists repeatedly upon his ugliness.) As Basquiat puts it at one point: \"You're so afraid to live you put a camera and a tape recorder between you and everything else.\" But Mr. Bettany, while sometimes saddled with self-explanatory monologues (I got shot! Did I mention I'm ugly?) or pronouncements about his belief that art will and should be entwined in the coils of business, brings a subtlety to the role that often surprises. Even in Warhol's garish white floppy wig and a black turtleneck, he manages to transcend the torrent of cliches we have been fed about the artist and make him a human figure.</p><p>Due to most viewers' lesser knowledge of Basquiat, Mr. Pope has a better chance to create a fully realized and unfamiliar character. Volatile, smart, wounded and fiercely suspicious of the enterprise that the artists' mutual Swiss dealer (Erik Jensen, exuding I'd-kill-myself-except-for-millions-on-the-line patience) has suggested, Mr. Pope is mesmerizingly good as Basquiat, flooding the stage with the intensity of a man who feels himself assailed by the vampiric tendencies of the art world, and who has been battling other demons all his life.</p><p>Directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah, \"The Collaboration\" moves through a fairly sluggish first act toward a more compelling conclusion, centering on the stark and striking revelation about one of Basquiat's former graffiti allies being brutally abused by the police. (Yes, it does strike an unhappily current note.) Our knowledge of the deaths of both Warhol and Basquiat is impossible to ignore -- and not always subtly foreshadowed. Basquiat, for instance, suggests that Warhol should get that gall bladder checked out.</p><p>Still, in the less didactic second act the play brings us into a believable intimacy with the growing friendship and grudging respect between the two artists. Cliches hail down less frequently, and there is a touching moment when Warhol tells Basquiat, who is on the verge of shooting up heroin, \"When people are ready to, they change. They never do it before then, and sometimes they die before they get around to it. I hope you don't die, Jean, before you get around to it.\" (I wish it hadn't been followed shortly after by Basquiat's defiant retort: \"I'm gonna be immortal, man,\" and his subsequent tearful plea, \"Andy, I'm hurting.\")</p><p>That observation about change is an actual quote from Warhol (without the reference to Jean). This speech, and some others, humanizes Warhol, and obliquely Basquiat, in a way that brings us closer to the puzzle of artists' lives, work and, all too often, as with these two brilliant but troubled figures, unhappy fates.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Isherwood is the Journal's theater critic.</p>",
