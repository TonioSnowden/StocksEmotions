  "title": "Stocks Fall, on Track for Fourth Weekly Loss; Chevron and Caterpillar sink after reporting results at end of market's roller-coaster week",
  "text": "<p>Chevron slid 4.1% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that were lower than expected, even as surging commodity prices lifted the oil producer to its most profitable year since 2014. Caterpillar tumbled 4.8% after the equipment maker reported a surge in costs that offset a jump in revenue.</p><p>Shares of Robinhood Markets sank nearly 8% after the brokerage popular with small investors reported a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.</p><p>Among the day's winners, Apple rose 3.6% after the tech giant posted record revenue and profits. Visa rallied 6.1% after beating analysts' forecasts for profits and sales.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments Wednesday added to expectations that the central bank will start a series of interest-rate increases in March. His words pushed up yields on short-term government bonds, boosted the dollar and renewed the stock-market turbulence.</p><p>\"Cheap money is like a comfort blanket for investors and for markets,\" said Jane Foley, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank. \"Almost inevitably, you start to withdraw some of that cheap money and you're going to have more volatility in the markets.\"</p><p>Government-bond prices fell, pushing up yields. The yield on interest-rate sensitive two-year Treasury notes ticked up to 1.216% from 1.190% Thursday and 0.993% at the end of last week. Yields on 10-year notes haven't risen as fast, which some analysts interpret as a sign investors think interest-rate rises by the Fed will squelch economic growth. They stood at 1.842% Friday, up from 1.747% a week ago.</p><p>Stocks have been choppy despite another solid round of earnings. Almost a third of the companies on the S&amp;P 500 have reported fourth-quarter results, and 78% of them have beaten analysts' estimates for earnings per share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Mondelez International slipped 4.7%. The food company said higher prices for its snacks weren't enough to make up for increased ingredient and transportation costs.</p><p>â€”Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Fall, on Track for Fourth Weekly Loss</p>",
