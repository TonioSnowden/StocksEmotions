  "title": "Tuesday's Markets:  Tech Stocks Drag Down S&P 500  ---  Dow industrials again  jump to record level,  paced by economically  sensitive companies  ----  By Karen Langley and Anna Hirtenstein",
  "text": "<p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to its second record of 2022, while declines in technology stocks weighed on the broad market. </p><p>   Stocks in economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials and industrials advanced as investors parsed manufacturing and labor data and focused on rising long-term bond yields. </p><p>   The retreat by tech stocks, meanwhile, helped pull the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lower. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 slipped 3.02 points, or 0.1%, to 4793.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 214.59 points, or 0.6%, to 36799.65. The Nasdaq Composite fell 210.08 points, or 1.3%, to 15622.72. </p><p>   The different corners of the stock market diverged as investors scrutinized data showing expanding U.S. factory activity and a tight labor market. </p><p>   A manufacturing sector survey showed signs that supply-chain problems could be improving. Separate data showed the number of times workers quit their jobs rose to a high in November, while job openings remained near record levels. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.666% from 1.628% on Monday. Yields rise as bond prices fall. </p><p>   The rise in yields \"probably is a sign that the bond market has more confidence in growth and is more likely for the Fed to continue down a path of higher rates next year,\" said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. </p><p>   Those developments are better for stocks tied to economic recovery and worse for growth stocks that trade at high valuations on expectations of very low rates, he said. </p><p>   Within the S&amp;P 500, the energy sector advanced 3.5%, the financial sector rose 2.6% and the industrial sector gained 2%. The technology segment declined 1.1%. </p><p>   Traders tend to pile into tech stocks when economic concerns mount, betting those shares can deliver growth. When the outlook brightens, they often rotate into companies that can harness themselves to a strong economy. </p><p>   Money managers are looking ahead to the next earnings season, which kicks off in earnest next week with reports from financial companies. </p><p>   Analysts estimate that profits from companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Among individual stocks, Apple shares fell $2.31, or 1.3%, to $179.70 after the company on Monday briefly touched $3 trillion in market value before closing below that threshold. Tesla shares dropped $50.19, or 4.2%, to $1149.59 after jumping 14% on Monday. </p><p>   Royal Caribbean shares rose $1.55, or 1.9%, to $82.38. United Airlines shares gained 76 cents, or 1.7%, to $46.25. Marriott International shares added $4.10, or 2.5%, to $168.01. </p><p>   Shares of Ford Motor jumped $2.54, or 12%, to $24.31, its highest close since August 2001, after the auto maker doubled its goal for manufacturing its new electric version of the F-150 pickup truck. </p><p>   Oil prices rose after OPEC and a Russia-led group of oil producers agreed to keep pumping more crude in a bet that the global surge in Covid-19 cases won't depress demand like earlier waves of the virus. Global benchmark Brent crude climbed 1.3% to $80 a barrel. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.8% to a record. </p><p>   Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up less than 0.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2%. </p><p></p>",
