  "text": "<p>   At a seemingly random point every 24 hours, Kevin Lee gets a notification to post a selfie. </p><p>   \"Time to BeReal,\" says the alert on his phone, and a two-minute countdown clock begins. </p><p>   Some mornings, the 27-year-old software engineer from Los Angeles receives the notification before he's gotten out of bed. \"I look terrible. But I just do it,\" Mr. Lee said. </p><p>   He's one of nearly 6.8 million people who've downloaded BeReal over the past two years, according to data from mobile-market intelligence company Sensor Tower. The app -- pitched by its makers as an authentic, unfiltered alternative to the curated posts on Instagram and TikTok -- has gained currency among younger people, particularly college students. Most of BeReal's users, such as Mr. Lee, joined this year, according to researcher Apptopia. </p><p>   The French app, which is available for iPhones and Android phones, pings users once in 24 hours to snap a photo using their smartphone's front- and rear-facing cameras. The prompt's timing is unpredictable for users and changes every day, and no photo filters are allowed. Unlike the most dominant social-media platforms, there are also no ads, and there are no visible follower tallies. </p><p>   BeReal's limited approach to posting and perusing is an alternate to apps such as TikTok and Instagram, which count more than a billion active monthly users apiece and plow money and engineers into making products more engrossing for users. BeReal has a different pitch: Post quickly, scroll and go live your life. For some Gen Z users, that's a magnetic idea. </p><p>   Nathan Carey, a 22-year-old student in Ireland, joined the app three weeks ago after hearing about it from his college friends. The rather mundane posts -- people watching TV or cooking dinner -- let him see his friends' lives as they are, rather than through highly curated images, he said. </p><p>   \"You can be more vulnerable,\" Mr. Carey said. </p><p>   After receiving an alert to \"BeReal,\" users have two minutes to snap a photo. If they're busy or in a place they shouldn't be taking selfies -- such as the bathroom -- BeReal allows users to post outside of that time frame, with a catch: The app tells their friends the photo is late and shows precisely how late they are. That has caused people to snap photos while in class and on the road, but many times, BeReal ends up with images of the photographer looking down at their feet. </p><p>   BeReal prevents users from lurking: To see anyone's images, users have to first share their own. If a user posts late, they don't have as much time to view others' photos; all posts reset when the next notification goes out. The aim is to share real life, when it's happening. </p><p>   What BeReal has going for it, say users and social-media experts, is its embrace of spontaneity and authenticity. It's a mix of Wordle (the popular word game that can be played only once a day) and Meta Platforms' Instagram (minus those filters). And the fleeting lifespan of the posts draws Snapchat comparisons. The combination is resonating with people who have started to shun the highly curated photos and videos that dominate feeds on many social networks. </p><p>   The biggest social-media apps started as ways for people to share updates with friends. But as those apps evolved to feature more idealistic versions of people's lives, big creator economies have flourished on the platforms, with influencers posting highly curated content to attract followers and sponsors. </p><p>   The change means users often see more commercial posts, creating a hole that an app such as BeReal could try to fill, said Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center in Newport Beach, Calif. Yet, she says, BeReal and other new social-media networks will have staying power only if they can keep people and their friends using the app. </p><p>   \"Lots of apps are fun to try, but the point of a social-media app is to connect with others,\" Dr. Rutledge said. </p><p>   BeReal wants users to portray their lives rather than share images to amass influence, a spokesperson said. \"We want to make people feel good about themselves and their lives,\" the spokesperson said. </p><p></p>",
