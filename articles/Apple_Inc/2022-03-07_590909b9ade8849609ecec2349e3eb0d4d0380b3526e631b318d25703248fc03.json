The all-new Turbo GT model is at the top of the model range, starting at $180,800.</p><p>The Porsche Cayenne was a pioneer in the world of performance luxury SUVs when it first came out. Now in its third generation, the Cayenne continues to truly be the Porsche POAHY of midsize crossovers. This SUV delivers the distinct aesthetic, thrilling performance, and posh interior associated with the&#xa0;Porsche&#xa0;brand with the versatility of a&#xa0;midsize luxury SUV, all with little compromise.</p><p>The Cayenne gets a couple of nice updates for 2022. Good news for Android users: The standard infotainment system in the Cayenne finally supports Android Auto. Also new for 2022 is an all-new 631-horsepower Turbo GT model, which is only available with the coupe body.</p><p>PorscheA new-for-2022 Porsche Platinum Edition may not have any performance upgrades, but it sure looks great. It has a brushed-platinum finish on its air intakes, 21-inch wheels, badges, and the rear lettering. Additionally, the tailpipes and window trim are gloss black.</p><p>Inside, the new Cayenne Platinum Edition is distinguished by unique sill plates, textured-aluminum trim, and chalk-colored seat belts that are in contrast to the perforated black leather on the 8-way power-adjustable seats.</p><p>The Porsche Cayenne is an SUV with few direct rivals. It's priced higher than almost every other player in this segment, like the BMW X5 XE:BMW, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, and Audi Q7. However, it's also a higher-performance SUV — even in the base trim — than most of this class. The closest competitor to the Cayenne in high-end midsize SUVs is the Maserati Levante, which is similar in size, price, and performance.</p><p>2022 Porsche Cayenne pricing</p><p>Pricing for the base Cayenne starts at $69,000 for the standard SUV and $77,500 for the coupe. The Cayenne Platinum Edition starts at $79,000 (or $83,300 for the Cayenne coupe version). The pricing of the higher-performance S model starts at $86,800 for the SUV and $91,100 for the coupe. A Cayenne S Platinum Edition starts at $93,400 (or $95,600 for the coupe).</p><p>The GTS trim pushes pricing into the 6-figure territory, starting at $109,000 for the SUV and $111,700 for the coupe. The Turbo model starts at $129,900 for the SUV and $133,500 for the coupe.</p><p>The 2022 Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid model starts at $83,300 for the SUV and $88,600 for the coupe. The Cayenne E-Hybrid Platinum Edition starts at $92,700 (or $93,800 for the coupe).</p><p>A sportier hybrid variant, the Turbo S E-Hybrid model, starts at $165,300 for the SUV and $167,800 for the coupe. Finally, the coupe-only Turbo GT model starts at $180,800.</p><p>Pricing for the Cayenne is higher than most of this segment. If you're shopping for a high-performance SUV in this class, rivals like the&#xa0;BMW X5 M,&#xa0;Audi SQ7, and the AMG variants of the&#xa0;Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class&#xa0;have lower prices than a Cayenne with similar performance numbers. The most similar rival to the Cayenne in terms of pricing is the&#xa0;Maserati Levante, which is another performance-oriented midsize luxury SUV.</p><p>A destination fee of $1,350 applies to all Cayenne models.</p><p>Also see: Porsche Taycan EV outsold the revered 911 last year</p><p>Driving the 2022 Porsche Cayenne</p><p>The dream of the SUV that drives like a sports car is alive in the Porsche Cayenne. It doesn't quite have the agility of its stablemates like the&#xa0;911&#xa0;and the&#xa0;718 Boxster/Cayman, but it's arguably the best-handling SUV in its class. That said, it's comfortable and compliant in long-distance cruising. Like every Porsche model, it's a performance car that doesn't forget it's also a luxury car.</p><p>See: Review: The 2022 Porsche 911 is still a leader in luxury sports cars</p><p>More powerful engines and high-performance engineering are introduced as you work your way up the Cayenne model range. The variety from the base model all the way up to the new-for-2022 Turbo GT model allows you to pick the Cayenne model that best fits your budget and your appetite for performance.</p><p>There are two different hybrid models available — the E-Hybrid and the higher-performance Turbo S E-Hybrid. As you may have inferred from the names, the Turbo S E-Hybrid prioritizes performance over efficiency, while the E-Hybrid is the more efficient option. Both hybrid models offer exciting electric torque that enables quick acceleration.</p><p>The driving character of the Cayenne becomes more customizable when you add the excellent Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) system with Normal and Sport modes. This is a worthwhile upgrade if your budget allows it. It adds dual-mode shocks that automatically adjust based on the road conditions, improving comfort and performance. There's also an air suspension available with five different ride heights, which is good if you plan to do some off-roading.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>The interior of the Porsche Cayenne is every bit as premium as you'd expect from a German luxury SUV. Like all Porsche models, this interior does a fabulous job striking a balance between Porsche tradition and modern luxury. The seats are supportive and comfortable, and the interior materials are top-notch. There's lots of piano black in the interior, like on the haptic feedback controls. It looks beautiful when clean but can quickly attract dust and fingerprints.</p><p>There's no shortage of seating space in both rows. There's generous headroom and legroom in the first and second rows, so the Cayenne can comfortably carry up to four adults for long distances without complaints. Like every SUV in this class, it gets a bit cramped if you put three people in the back. Unlike some rivals, there's no 3-row option for the Cayenne.</p><p>The Porsche Cayenne has more cargo space than its previous generation, but its cargo hold is still a little tight compared with most rivals. It has by far the most cargo space of any Porsche model, but if utility is your priority, consider one of the Cayenne's roomier rivals.</p><p>You might like:The 2023 BMW iX M60 is a faster, high performance version of the electric SUV</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The exterior of the Porsche Cayenne displays pure Porsche style in an SUV package. It's unmistakably a Porsche from any angle but has the utilitarian shape and size of a midsize crossover. Thanks to its low stance and staggered tire widths, it creates a sportier look than the average SUV.</p><p>The look of the Cayenne changes depending on the trim. Working your way up the model range brings bigger wheels, sporty ground effects, and more unique touches. For example, the GTS trim has a Sport Design package with dark accents and distinct black wheels. Something that makes the hybrid models stand out is the use of neon green brake calipers.</p><p>There's a sleek coupe variant available for the Cayenne. This creates a sloping roofline that gives the Cayenne a more coupe-like appearance reminiscent of a more traditional Porsche. While it looks sportier, the coupe adds quite a bit to the price tag and cuts down on cargo space.</p><p>Check out: Use an SUV or pickup truck for your small business?

Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration come standard.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>The 2022 Porsche Cayenne comes well-appointed at the base level. Standard features include all-wheel drive, rain-sensing wipers, power liftgate, 19-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and taillights, front/rear parking sensors, universal garage door opener, partial leather seats, power-adjustable front seats, paddle shifters, 10-speaker audio, and four USB ports.</p><p>The standard infotainment system in the Cayenne is a 12.3-inch screen with navigation, wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay, and — new for 2022 — wired Android Auto. This screen is big, easy to use, and highly customizable.</p><p>Factory options</p><p>The various trims in the Cayenne model range mostly bring with them mechanical upgrades. If you want more luxury or tech features, those usually come in packages. When choosing which Cayenne is right for you, you select the trim based on the level of performance you're looking for, and you can add more features on top of that.</p><p>A few of our favorite performance options include Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), which is standard on GTS and up, but optional on the lower trims; Porsche Surface Coated Brakes (PSCB); and the Sport Chrono Package, which adds launch control, a Sport Plus mode, rear-wheel steering, and a stopwatch.</p><p>An available Off-Road Package adds extra underbody protection, an additional towing camera, and more off-road-oriented displays like a compass and steering angle display.</p><p>Some luxury features available on the Cayenne include heated and cooled front seats, multiple premium audio systems, a panoramic roof, 4-zone climate control, and a range of upscale leather seating and interior trims with materials like carbon fiber and natural wood.</p><p>A few driver assistance tech features available to add to the Cayenne include adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, head-up display, surround-view camera, night vision assist, and remote parking assist.</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>The base engine in the Porsche Cayenne is a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 producing 335 horsepower. That makes it one of the more powerful base engines in this segment, which is part of the reason it has a higher starting price than most rivals.</p><p>The base engine is the basis for the Cayenne E-Hybrid, which adds an electric motor and makes a net output of 455 horsepower. It has a combined 46 MPGe rating and can go up to 17 miles on electricity alone.</p><p>The Cayenne S is powered by a 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6 pumping out 434 horsepower. If you want a high-performance luxury SUV while keeping the price under $100,000, this is the Cayenne to get.</p><p>There's a stellar 4.0-liter twin-turbo that's available in four distinct variants. The entry-level V8 model is the GTS trim, which delivers 453 horsepower. This engine in the Turbo model makes 541 hp, and that number shoots up to 631 hp in the coupe-only Turbo GT trim.</p><p>Don't miss: ‘Beer' for dogs?</p><p>The V8 is also the basis for the Turbo S E-Hybrid model, with a combined output of 670 hp. It's rated at 42 MPGe combined in city and highway driving, and it can go up to 15 miles on electricity.</p><p>Every 2022 Porsche Cayenne has all-wheel drive and a quick-shifting 8-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission.</p><p>3.0-liter turbocharged V6 (Cayenne)335 horsepower @ 5,300-6,400 rpm322 lb-ft of torque @ 1,340-5,300 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/22 mpg</p><p>3.0-liter turbocharged V6 + electric motor (Cayenne E-Hybrid)455 horsepower @ 5,300-6,400 rpm (net system horsepower)516 lb-ft of torque @ 1,340-5,300 rpm (net system torque)EPA combined fuel economy: 46 MPGe (gas &amp; electric), 21 mpg (gas)</p><p>2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (Cayenne S)434 horsepower @ 5,700-6,600 rpm406 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-5,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/22 mpg</p><p>4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (Cayenne GTS)453 horsepower @ 6,000-6,500 rpm457 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-4,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/19 mpg</p><p>4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (Cayenne Turbo)541 horsepower @ 5,750-6,000 rpm568 lb-ft of torque @ 1,960-4,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/19 mpg</p><p>4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 + electric motor (Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid)670 horsepower @ 5,750-6,000 rpm (net system horsepower)663 lb-ft of torque @ 2,100-4,500 rpm (net system torque)EPA combined fuel economy: 42 MPGe (gas &amp; electric), 18 mpg (gas)</p><p>4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (Cayenne Turbo GT)631 horsepower @ 5,750-6,000 rpm626 lb-ft of torque @ 1,960-4,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/19 mpg</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
