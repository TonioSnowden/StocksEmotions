  "text": "<p>   Sonos Inc. netted a legal victory in a patent dispute with Google, as a U.S. trade judge ruled Friday that some Pixel smartphones and Nest audio speakers infringe on Sonos's technology and could be barred from import. </p><p>   Judge Charles Bullock of the U.S. International Trade Commission found that Google has infringed on five patents related to synchronizing audio, adjusting volume and connecting to Wi-Fi. The judge's full ruling is expected in coming days. </p><p>   The initial decision should help Sonos as it presses Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google to strike a royalty agreement for a portfolio of patents. Amid rising competition from Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and others, the speaker maker has looked to supplement hardware sales by licensing its portfolio of patents to other tech companies. Analysts estimate such an agreement could be worth as much as $50 million annually. Sonos reported $1.34 billion in its latest fiscal year ended Oct. 3. </p><p>   The patent dispute is playing out as regulatory pressure rises for tech giants, including Google, Apple and Amazon, which lawmakers and regulators alike have accused of using their platforms to curtail competition. Sonos has helped lead an attack against those larger players, testifying before the Senate that they subsidize products to gain market share and collect data to further their dominance. </p><p>   \"This decision re-affirms the strength and breadth of our portfolio, marking a promising milestone in our long-term pursuit to defend our innovation against misappropriation by Big Tech monopolies,\" said Eddie Lazarus, Sonos' chief legal officer. </p><p>   Google has denied Sonos's patent-infringement claims, saying that the technologies that its products use were independently developed by Google. \"We disagree with this preliminary ruling and will continue to make our case in the upcoming review process,\" said Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman. </p><p>   Shares of Sonos rose more than 11% to $42.40 after the market closed. </p><p>   The ITC case is part of a full-court press Sonos has advanced against Google for more than a year, filing a complementary patent-infringement lawsuit in U.S. District Court in California and later in Texas. It won a patent case in Germany, which has prohibited the sale of some Pixel smartphones and Nest speakers. </p><p>   Google has fought back, countersuing Sonos in June for patent infringement in California federal court. Its lawsuit claims Sonos infringed on five Google patents, including ones related to echo cancellation and search. It has appealed the decision in the Germany case. </p><p>   The ITC judge's decision Friday will be reviewed by the full commission, which will have the option to accept or modify his determination. Afterward, the Biden administration can accept the ruling and allow a potential import ban or forgo it out of public interest. </p><p>   The ultimate decision on a ban will be made by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. In 2013, the Obama administration vetoed an ITC ruling that would ban the import and sale of some iPhones after Apple Inc. lost a case to Samsung Electronics Co. </p><p>   The commission's final decision is expected in December. If Ms. Tai approves an import ban, it wouldn't be introduced until early next year -- after the Christmas shopping season. Most of Google's hardware products are imported from Asia. </p><p></p>",
