  "text": "<p>   BRUSSELS -- The U.S. and European Union reached a preliminary deal to allow data about Europeans to be stored on U.S. soil, heading off a growing threat to thousands of companies' trans-Atlantic operations. </p><p>   The deal, announced Friday by President Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, could resolve one of the thorniest outstanding issues between the economic giants. It also assuages concerns of companies including Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google that were facing mounting legal challenges to data transfers that underpin some operations in Europe. </p><p>   Hanging in the balance has been the ability of businesses to use U.S.-based data centers to do things like sell online ads, measure their website traffic or manage company payroll in Europe. </p><p>   An earlier deal authorizing trans-Atlantic data flows was deemed illegal by the EU's top court in 2020. That ruling was the second time since 2015 that the EU's Court of Justice had deemed U.S. safeguards on Europeans' data to be insufficient. The court said the U.S. didn't provide EU citizens effective means to challenge U.S. government surveillance of their data when it is in the U.S. </p><p>   The new deal, dubbed the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, attempts to address the EU top court's concerns by establishing an appeals process for EU individuals that includes what the U.S. calls an independent Data Protection Review Court with binding authority to adjudicate claims and impose remedies. </p><p>   The new U.S. data-protection court, along with a commitment to limit disproportionate signals intelligence collection, will be created via a U.S. executive order, both EU and U.S. officials said. </p><p>   One issue in the talks in recent months, according to people briefed on their content, has been whether a mechanism that is implemented without a change to U.S. law would satisfy the EU's top court. </p><p>   Officials and observers on both sides of the Atlantic expect the new agreement to be challenged in court again, raising some uncertainty about how long Friday's deal will last. </p><p>   Mr. Biden said the \"framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, to data protection and to the rule of law\" and would allow EU authorities \"to once again authorize trans-Atlantic data flows that help facilitate $7.1 trillion in economic relations with the EU.\" </p><p>   Ms. von der Leyen said the agreement \"will enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S., safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.\" </p><p>   If successful, the data agreement would resolve one of the last big points of contention in U.S.-EU relations of recent years. Over the past year, the two sides have agreed a truce in their long-running fight over subsidies to Airbus SE and Boeing Co., struck a deal to unwind U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and have increasingly aligned their positions regarding China's economic practices. </p><p>   \"Just like we did when we resolved the Boeing-Airbus dispute and lifted the steel aluminum tariffs, the United States and the EU are finding creative new approaches to bring our economies and our people closer together on shared values,\" Mr. Biden said. </p><p>   The deal, if it stands, would mark a major victory for thousands of companies in an array of sectors that transfer data from the EU to the U.S., many of which have warned in securities filings of potential disruption should they be forced to cut off trans-Atlantic data flows. </p><p>   Friday's deal is particularly important for big U.S. technology companies that have called on diplomats to strike a deal to head off more cases in which European privacy regulators are ordering them or their clients to cut off their transfer of data to the U.S. </p><p>   In France and Austria, regulators citing the 2020 EU court decision have recently ordered certain websites to stop using Alphabet's Google Analytics service because it sends information about users' internet addresses to the U.S., where the regulators say it could be requested by government agencies. Similar cases are pending in other EU countries. </p><p>   Ireland's Data Protection Commission has also been completing a draft order under the EU court precedent that could have forced Meta Platforms' Facebook to stop sending certain data about its users to servers in the U.S., because it could be caught in surveillance requests. Meta has warned that such an order, if implemented, could force it to stop offering some of its services in Europe. </p><p>   But privacy lawyers and experts say such orders would likely be pre-empted or delayed by the new EU-U.S. agreement -- at least until a new court battle is fought -- because the new framework addresses the same concerns that the EU court raised in 2020. </p><p>   On Friday, tech companies including Google and Meta commended the deal. The Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, which represents companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., said the deal should \"restore legal certainty for thousands of businesses that routinely transfer commercial data between the EU and U.S.\" </p><p></p>",
