  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Eating & Drinking -- Slow Food Fast: Boneless Pork Chops With Warm Radicchio and Apple Slaw",
  "text": "<p>Her Restaurant: Myriel in St. Paul, Minn.</p><p>What She's Known For: Cooking rustic French dishes with timeless appeal. Celebrating the bounty of the American Midwest and her family's farming heritage with fastidiously sourced ingredients.</p><p>\"I really love pork,\" said Karyn Tomlinson. At her Minnesota restaurant, the chef usually serves chops bone-in. But here, for her final Slow Food Fast contribution, she takes a more home-cook-friendly route, pairing boneless pork chops with a warm radicchio and apple slaw that turns the dish into a complete autumnal celebration.</p><p>The radicchio is first dry-seared in a hot pan, then sliced while still warm and tossed in a punchy mixture of maple syrup, coarse mustard and red wine vinegar. Tart apple slivers and sauteed shallot lend textural contrast and a hit of freshness.</p><p>While boneless chops are easy to work with, they can turn tough if not handled deftly. To keep them tender, sear gently and make sure their internal temperature doesn't creep above 145 degrees. \"Otherwise,\" Ms. Tomlinson cautioned, \"the outside will dry as the inside cooks.\" That precision pays big dividends: blushing and juicy pork that plays perfectly off the piquant seasonal salad.</p><p>---</p><p>Serves: 4</p><p>Total Time: 25 minutes</p><p>4 (1-inch thick) boneless pork chops</p><p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p>1 tablespoon maple syrup</p><p>1 tablespoon coarse mustard</p><p>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</p><p>1 head of radicchio, quartered</p><p>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</p><p>1 shallot, thinly sliced</p><p>1 tart apple, cut into thin batons</p><p>2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley, chopped</p><p>1. Season chops generously with salt and pepper on both sides. In a medium bowl, combine maple syrup, mustard and vinegar.</p><p>2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and place a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add radicchio wedges, cut-sides down. Sear, turning until charred all around, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer radicchio to a cutting board and, while still warm, slice into thin strips on the bias. Add sliced radicchio to bowl with maple syrup mixture and toss. Season with salt, cover and keep warm.</p><p>3. Set the large cast iron skillet back over medium heat and swirl in 3 tablespoons butter. Add chops and sear until both sides are golden and glistening, about 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer pan to oven and roast until each chop's internal temperature reaches 145 degrees, about 3-5 minutes more. Transfer chops to a plate and set aside.</p><p>4. Meanwhile, add shallot to the same pan used for roasting chops. Add 1 tablespoon of butter and cook shallot until translucent and soft, about 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour drippings and shallot onto radicchio mixture. Toss in apple slices and parsley. Season with salt.</p><p>5. Divide slaw among 4 plates. Slice chops across the grain, then lay them atop the vegetables. Serve immediately.</p>",
