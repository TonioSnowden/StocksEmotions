  "text": "<p>\"We think this is a cleaner, more coherent proposition,\" said PlayStation boss Jim Ryan.</p><p>Sony's main videogame rival, Microsoft Corp., has a single subscription service with multiplayer and cloud-games support for its Xbox users called Game Pass. It was launched in 2017, and Microsoft said in January that it had 25 million subscribers.</p><p>Sony and Microsoft consider cloud gaming, also called game streaming, to be the future of game distribution. The nascent technology eliminates the need for people to download games to their devices, which takes up memory, or invest in dedicated games hardware such as a console or a high-end computer.</p><p>Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have also launched subscription-based cloud-games services in recent years. Meta Platforms Inc. began adding free cloud games to its Facebook Gaming platform in 2020.</p><p>Though Microsoft's Game Pass commonly features first-party games the same day they go on sale, subscribers to the new version of Sony's PlayStation Plus shouldn't expect the same. In most cases those titles will come later, according to Mr. Ryan.</p><p>Featuring all new releases at launch \"would not allow us to sustain the level of investment we're making into our studios,\" he said. \"And it would not allow us to price the service at the level that we are pricing it at.\"</p><p>Sony has been expanding its game-development teams, most recently by reaching deals to acquire Bungie Inc. for $3.6 billion and Haven Studios for an undisclosed sum. Microsoft has been doing the same. In January it announced plans to purchase Activision Blizzard Inc. in a deal valued at roughly $75 billion, its largest ever by far.</p><p>Subscription services have been gaining prominence throughout the game industry. Last week, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.'s Rockstar Games Studio said it was introducing one for \"Grand Theft Auto Online.\" Netflix Inc. recently added mobile games as a free perk for subscribers to its streaming app. A few years ago, Apple Inc. and Google created subscription mobile-game services for their app stores.</p><p>Sony's new move in the subscription space is essentially a way to streamline its past offerings and potentially boost its recurring revenue stream, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies Inc., a market-intelligence and strategy consulting firm. \"From a branding perspective, it was somewhat confusing,\" Ms. Milanesi said of the company's previous two subscription models.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
