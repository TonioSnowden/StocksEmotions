  "title": "How Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir Became the Most Unconventional Marathon Champion; After winning the Olympic, New York City and Boston Marathons in the past year, Jepchirchir is back in the Big Apple for a 10k",
  "text": "<p>It's the distance running equivalent of a \"Serena Slam,\"—if the major tennis tournaments Serena Williams won in a single 12-month period had extracted an even more brutal toll on the legs. And it's something that no runner—man or woman—had done before the 28-year-old Kenyan shifted her focus from the half marathon, where she has thrice broken the world record, to the grueling 26-mile race in 2019.</p><p>\"When you see that you are winning and you see the tape in front of you, you get energy that you had no way of knowing and find yourself kicking,\" Jepchirchir said in an interview this week. \"I like competition.\"</p><p>It isn't just on international podiums that Jepchirchir is redefining success in long-distance running. She does all of her training alone, albeit with male pacesetters while her husband follows behind in his truck. She follows every marathon with about three weeks off from exercise. And she took two years away from competition in the prime of her career to have a child. Jepchirchir says she gained and lost nearly 50 pounds on her tiny 5-foot-3 frame in the process.</p><p>It's an unusual approach rooted in patience and rest that was designed by her husband-turned-coach Davis Ng'eno and has turned Jepchirchir into perhaps the greatest female marathoner in the world.</p><p>One of Jepchirchir's strengths is her closing speed. It was evident during her victory in Boston,when she traded leads with Ethiopian Ababel Yeshaneh throughout and didn't pull away until the final 100 meters to finish in 2:21:01.</p><p>It's also something that will be on display this weekend, as Jepchirchir returns to New York City to race on Saturday in the Mastercard New York Mini 10k, a distance she hasn't raced professionally since 2015.</p><p>According to Ng'eno, it is a skill she honed during years of training for shorter races. Jepchirchir started running professionally in 2013 and aimed to make the Kenyan Olympic team for the 2016 Rio Games in the 10,000 meters, which consists of 25 laps around a track. She ran a 10k road race as fast as 30:55 in 2015, but her time was then behind seven other Kenyan women and Jepchirchir was left off the team.</p><p>Around then, Jepchirchir started moving toward half marathons, an event that is not contested in the Olympics. In 2015, she started training with Ng'eno, who she had met in 2012 through their church near Kapsabet, Kenya. He encouraged her to do her training sessions solo, albeit with pacers, rather than with the group of elite women with whom she had been running for years. Jepchirchir said the switch allowed her to adjust her workouts to how her body felt on a given day. It paid off: by early 2016, Jepchirchir lowered her personal best to 1:06:39—a blistering 5:05 per mile pace.</p><p>Then, in February 2017 at a race in the United Arab Emirates, she broke the world record with a time of 1:05:06, averaging 4:58 per mile. It was a remarkable achievement made even more so by a later revelation: she had been a few weeks pregnant at the time.</p><p>It isn't unusual for women runners to delay motherhood until retirement. Jepchirchir, on the other hand, followed up her record-setting performance by not racing for two years.</p><p>\"If you ask Peres what her priorities were then, I think it was family and church…. She would probably put her running third,\" said Creigh Kelley, a longtime race director from Colorado who became close to the family a decade ago.</p><p>Jepchirchir said that she added 23 kilograms-—nearly 50 pounds—before giving birth to her daughter, Natalia, in October 2017. She spent the better part of 2018 working back to her racing weight of 42 kilograms, about 93 pounds.</p><p>\"It wasn't easy,\" Jepchirchir said. \"My worry a little bit was to leave my daughter, when she was still young, for training.\" At the same time, she added, having Natalia gave her an extra dose of motivation. \"I work extra hard knowing that someone is depending on me.\"</p><p>Prior to having her daughter, Jepchirchir had raced only one marathon, in 2013. Ng'eno geared her comeback toward longer distances. Once she regained her fitness, she averaged about 18 miles of running per day, sometimes running as far as 25 miles on her longest run of the week.</p><p>Her comeback race was a small marathon in her hometown in November 2018, finishing the hilly course in 2:46:15. She broke the tape at her next marathon in December 2019 in 2:23:50. It vaulted Jepchirchir into the mix of Kenya's elite women marathoners, but not high enough to be considered to represent the country at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics when Athletics Kenya first announced the three-woman squad.</p><p>Then came a global pandemic that scuttled the international racing calendar. When the Olympics were postponed until 2021, it opened the door for Jepchirchir to take another stab at an Olympic berth.</p><p>Jepchirchir set a half marathon world record for a women's only race at a tuneup event in September 2020 only to break it again in October at the Half Marathon World Championships with a winning time of 1:05:16. Then, on the flat streets of Valencia, Spain, in December, she blasted a 2:17:16 marathon, an average pace of 5:14 minutes per mile.</p><p>\"When she starts in a race it's like a switch has been flipped,\" Kelley said. \"She becomes a lioness.\"</p><p>Jepchirchir was too fast to ignore and made the Kenyan marathon team in January 2021, setting her up for the busiest and most successful year of her short marathoning career.</p><p>Ng'eno said that Jepchirchir will likely return to New York City to defend her title this November. She also has her eye on taking down countrywoman Brigid Kosgei's marathon world record time of 2:14:04.</p><p>\"Maybe next year,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Laine Higgins at laine.higgins@wsj.com</p><p>How Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir Became the Most Unconventional Marathon Champion</p>",
