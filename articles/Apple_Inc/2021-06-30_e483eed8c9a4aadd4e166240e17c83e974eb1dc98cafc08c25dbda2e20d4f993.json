  "text": "<p>   I don't know if I'll ever visit home again. If I do, I might be arrested. </p><p>   The Chinese Communist Party is taking over Hong Kong, and last week authorities succeeded in shutting down the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. Authorities have suggested that telling the world about what's happening to Hong Kongers endangers national security, a crime punishable by up to life in prison. </p><p>   I'm afraid because I've been an accomplice. Since May 2020, I have led a small team that translated Apple Daily's editorials and opinions from Chinese to English so that the publication can reach a global audience. Last August 200 police raided Apple Daily's newsroom and led the paper's founder, Jimmy Lai, off in handcuffs. He's currently jailed for his role in the pro-democracy protests of 2019, and he also faces charges under the National Security Law, which Beijing is using to silence its critics. On June 18 the police arrested five top executive and journalists, including the editor in chief, under the National Security Law. And on June 23 police arrested Yeung Ching-Kei, Apple Daily's China Beat editorial writer, who uses the pen name Li Ping. </p><p>   Superintendent Steve Li-Kwai-wah of the Hong Kong National Security Department said the recent arrests were based on 30 to 40 articles in Chinese and English that called on foreign powers to impose sanctions on China and Hong Kong, thus \"endangering national security.\" </p><p>   These arrests hit close to home, even though I live in the U.S. As a translator, I came to know Apple Daily's journalists so intimately that I could identify the author of an editorial piece solely from the cadence and rhythm of the writing. </p><p>   Mr. Yeung was the last one to make it on Apple Daily's English-language website before it went dark. Of the five editorial writers, he wrote in the style that would be most accessible to a mainland audience, and was often dead-on with his criticisms of mainland politics. When I translated his final contribution -- a satirical piece on the Chinese Communist Party's use of history to reinforce its ideologies -- I noticed how he used the idiom \"don't wet the bed right before dawn.\" That was a comment from Chinese philosopher Feng Youlan's wife about her elderly husband's attempts to curry favor with the Gang of Four during the Cultural Revolution. </p><p>   Mr. Yeung was arrested on \"suspicion of conspiring to collude with foreign countries or foreign forces to endanger national security.\" Is the translator also considered part of the conspiracy? </p><p>   I could have come up with a list of reasons why he was the only editorial and opinion writer arrested so far. Or I could have been overanalyzing things. I didn't know -- and that's the point, because the real trick to the Chinese Communists' red line is that it is invisible. You can't know if you're violating the law or if you'll be next. </p><p>   On June 26 Fung Wai-kong, executive editor of Apple Daily English, who used the pen name Lo Fung, was led off at the Hong Kong Airport close to midnight before his scheduled flight for the U.K. </p><p>   Apple Daily isn't the only outlet Beijing seeks to silence. Bao Choy, a program producer with Hong Kong's public broadcaster, RTHK, was found guilty in April of \"knowingly making a false statement\" to access a public license-plate database for the documentary \"Who Owns the Truth,\" which uncovers details about the allegedly organized attack on citizens and the police's inaction in the Yuen Long district on July 21, 2019. Cable News' China team resigned en masse; Now News replaced its leadership; and RTHK's editor in chief, Leung Ka-wing, resigned. He was replaced by an administrative officer with no experience in journalism who has since been axing programs and firing hosts. </p><p>   Apple Daily's death comes when it's more important than ever for journalists to tell the world what's happening in Hong Kong. In the past year China imposed the National Security Law by fiat, postponed Hong Kong's Legislative Council elections and further rigged the political system. It arrested most of the political opposition, including pro-democracy icons like Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Lee Cheuk-yan, Claudia Mo and our own Mr. Lai. It intercepted and imprisoned 12 young Hong Kong residents who were fleeing for freedom in Taiwan by boat. </p><p>   As the rest of the world recovers from Covid-19 pandemic, Hong Kong falls deeper into the abyss. Every day seems like it could be the last, for anything could happen in the next minute. We are all witnesses to history. It is more critical than ever for those of us who are able to speak out to do so, because the death of Apple Daily is proof of how much the regime fears words. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Leung was a freelance translator for Apple Daily English. </p><p></p>",
