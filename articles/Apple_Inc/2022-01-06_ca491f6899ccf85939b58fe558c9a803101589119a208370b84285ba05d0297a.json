  "text": "<p>Technology shares skidded at the end of a wild trading day on Thursday, in which a mixed bag of economic data coupled with a hawkish tilt from the Federal Reserve clouded the investment outlook for US stocks. </p> <p>Wall Street's technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite share index, which dropped 3.3 per cent on Wednesday in its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bcd6762-6bcc-4b95-a149-45d1bd077e05\">worst session</a> since February, slid 0.1 per cent. </p> <p>But the small decline conceals what had been a volatile trading session, with the index falling as much as 1.2 per cent at one point before rallying as much as 0.7 per cent.</p> <p>The whipsaw moves followed weak services data, which signalled continued supply-chain disruption, and higher-than-expected initial jobless claims. The data initially prompted a pause in the shift away from high-valuation tech stocks that are seen as the near-term casualty of a resurgent economy and higher Treasury yields. </p> <p>However the weaker data on Thursday contrasted with numbers on Wednesday showing an increase in private payrolls and higher than forecast manufacturing data. Also on Wednesday, minutes from the latest Fed meeting showed that it may move to raise interest rates and tighten financial conditions more quickly than expected, contributing to the move away from shares in interest-rate sensitive technology companies. </p> <p>Markets have entered an “unstable equilibrium”, according to Alex Veroude, chief investment officer for North America at Insight Investment. </p> <p>“I think everybody is having a think today on how hawkish the Fed really is going to be,” he said. “I think it will take some time for people to formulate a view.”</p> <p>The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index also bounced around before closing 0.1 per cent lower, with shares of large technology groups driving both ends of the benchmark's performance. </p> <p>Companies including Apple and Tesla pulled the index down with losses of 1.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively. Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Nvidia pushed it higher with gains of 2.6 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively. </p> <p>The closely watched Ark Innovation exchange traded fund also recovered from some of its earlier losses on Thursday, finishing the day down 0.5 per cent. The down day took its losses for the year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/208f8669-de4b-444a-89d0-a6ba6af076e9\">to more than 9 per cent</a>, extending a sharp decline in 2021.</p> <p>Overall, the energy sector was the best performing industry within the S&amp;P 500 as Brent crude oil rose 1.5 per cent to $81.99 a barrel.</p> <p>In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 equity gauge closed 1.3 per cent lower and in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed about 2.9 per cent lower. Mainland China's CSI 300 fell 1 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.7 per cent, however, as heavy declines for Chinese technology stocks went into reverse. </p> <p>“Markets are awakening to the end of easy money,” said Olivier Marciot, cross-asset investment manager at Unigestion.</p> <p>“We have had a lot of quantitative easing and monetary support, which creates an environment where all assets tend to thrive, and when you remove that it is the reverse,” he added. </p> <p>Government bond yields rose as investors continued to price in a quickening pace of central bank policy tightening. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury, which rises as prices of the government debt instrument fall, added about 0.02 percentage points to 1.72 per cent. This marked a slowing in the sell-off that saw the debt yield — which influences borrowing costs and asset valuations worldwide — climb from about 1.51 per cent at the start of this week. </p> <p>European government bonds were also swept up in the post-Fed minutes sell-off. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to minus 0.07 per cent, its highest level since May 2019.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Tommy Stubbington</em></p><p>Source: Joe Rennison in New York, Naomi Rovnick in London and William Langley in Hong Kong 2022 'US tech shares swing as investors assess Fed minutes and mixed data' FT.com 6 January.
