  "title": "Chinese Consumers Embrace iPhone 13",
  "text": "<p>In China, consumers latched onto the comparatively low price of the latest iPhones, which cost about as much as iPhone 12s did a year ago. By Wednesday morning, the topic \"iPhone 13 price\" had garnered more than a billion views on the Twitter-like social-media platform Weibo. Some internet users drew on a similarly named Chinese spice brand to make a punning comment that \"thirteen is delicious.\"</p><p>China accounts for about one-fifth of iPhone sales, according to analyst estimates, making it a critical part of Apple's success.</p><p>Apple kept prices in place despite rising costs for raw materials and electronic components that have driven up the prices of other consumer goods. The least-expensive model in the new lineup, the $699 iPhone 13 mini with a 5.4-inch screen, has 128 gigabytes of memory and costs the same as the 64-gigabyte iPhone 12 mini did when it was introduced a year ago.</p><p>\"What attracts me here is getting more capacity for the same price or even lower,\" said Deng Yu, a 32-year-old media worker in the central Chinese city of Changsha. Mr. Deng is buying a new iPhone for his wife, whose current iPhone XR has lasted for about three years.</p><p>Lu Yiyang, a 40-year-old pharmaceutical researcher in Shanghai who has decided to buy a new iPhone 13 mini, said he liked the new colors such as pink but didn't see anything special in the other new features.</p><p>The iPhone 12 had a banner year in China, in part because it was the first to offer ultrafast fifth-generation, or 5G, cellular-data service.</p><p>Apple is also benefiting from the troubles of its most important local rival in China for the premium smartphone market, Huawei Technologies Co. Huawei was hit by U.S. sanctions last year that restricted the company's access to the most advanced semiconductors and squeezed its smartphone production. Since then, sales have plummeted.</p><p>\"You cannot find Huawei phones out in the market,\" said Mengmeng Zhang, a Beijing-based analyst with Counterpoint Research. \"There will be a lot of users who if they want to buy a premium phone, their only option is to buy from Apple.\"</p><p>In a June report, Morgan Stanley analysts said they expected China's smartphone market to grow by 6% this year. A survey by the brokerage found that more than 30% of potential Huawei smartphone owners said they would opt for an iPhone if Huawei was unavailable.</p><p>Other Chinese brands still pose a challenge, especially with the Beijing government promoting nationalist sentiments. Brands such as Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi -- which make up the top three in China, followed by Apple -- typically cost less than an iPhone and offer features aimed at local consumers.</p><p>Xiaomi Corp., in particular, is also a threat to Apple globally. In this year's April-June quarter, Xiaomi overtook Apple as the second-largest smartphone maker in global shipments behind Samsung Electronics Co., thanks to strength in regions such as Latin America, Africa and Western Europe, according to research firm Canalys.</p><p>Apple is vulnerable to shortages of semiconductors and other parts. The new high-end iPhone 13 models with memory of up to one terabyte are heavy users of semiconductors.</p>",
