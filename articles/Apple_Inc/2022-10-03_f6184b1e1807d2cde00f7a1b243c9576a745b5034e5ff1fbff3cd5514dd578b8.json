  "title": "Will Smith's 'Emancipation' Will Be in Theaters Dec. 2, Apple Says; Actor's first film since slap at Oscars will also be streamed on Apple TV+ starting Dec. 9",
  "text": "<p>The rollout would be similar to what the company did for \"CODA,\" which Apple TV+ releasedlast year. The film won the best picture Oscar, the first such win for a streaming service or for Apple.</p><p>The timing could put Mr. Smith back on the awards circuit. Movies need to be released in theaters before the end of the year to be considered for that year's Oscars awards, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which runs the show.</p><p>Mr. Smith was banned from Oscars award ceremonies for the next 10 years after he slapped Mr. Rock in the face on stage in March for making a joke about his wife. The incident, which came shortly before Mr. Smith won a best actor Oscar for his role in \"King Richard,\" dominated the evening.</p><p>The academy didn't say that Mr. Smith was disqualified from future Oscar nominations or wins, and it didn't revoke his trophy.</p><p>Mr. Smith apologized in an Instagram post a day after the awards ceremony. In July, he also posted a 5-minute YouTube video where he again apologized to Mr. Rock. \"My behavior was unacceptable,\" he said in the video, which has been viewed more than 3.8 million times.</p><p>Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A representative for Mr. Smith also didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>\"Emancipation,\" which is inspired by a true story, is about a slave who embarks on a journey to reunite with his family. When Mr. Smith agreed to star in the film in 2020, it became one of the buzziest titles at a virtual market held by the Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>Mr. Smith on Monday posted the trailer for \"Emancipation\" on his social-media accounts.</p><p>\"This was the hardest movie I've ever made. Blood, Sweat &amp; Tearsâ€¦LITERALLY!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Shoutout to Apple who doubled (and tripled) down on their commitment to deliver this epic story to the world.\"</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>Will Smith's 'Emancipation' Will Be in Theaters Dec. 2, Apple Says</p>",
