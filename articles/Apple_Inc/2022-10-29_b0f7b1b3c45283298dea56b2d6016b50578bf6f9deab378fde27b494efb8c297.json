  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Adventure & Travel:  Salem's  Magic  Formula  ---  Even for travelers who  shun kitsch, the town's  strange brew of  quirkiness and history  is tough to resist. But  beware October.  ----  By Hillary Richard",
  "text": "<p>   Lorelei Stathopoulos, the owner of the Crow Haven Corner shop in Salem, Mass., is a psychic reader, as well as a \"love witch.\" She offers phone consultations but prefers to cast her spells in her kitchen, just above the store. In early October, when I arrived for my \"Apple Love Spell\" -- a 60-minute, $225 session that also includes Champagne and a cheese board -- Ms. Stathopoulos greeted me wearing a gold dress with a white-chiffon cape, trailed by her two chihuahuas. By the time I left, a line of a dozen or so people had formed outside Crow Haven Corner, which sits on Essex Street next to a museum dedicated to Ouija boards. </p><p>   Long entry lines outside the city's dozens of witch-themed shops and museums are common this time of year, when the streets swell with visitors in search of otherworldly diversions. This former seaport with a population of roughly 45,000 welcomed more than 285,000 visitors in the first half of October, the busiest month of the year. Hotels charge a premium in this period and sell out quickly. Rooms at the new Hampton Inn were going for $1,000 over Halloween weekend. On a recent October Saturday, the Salem Witch Museum released same-day tickets online at midnight. By 12:08 a.m., they had sold out. </p><p>   Salem was founded in 1626 as a Puritan fishing community -- six years after the Mayflower pilgrims settled in Plymouth, some 60 miles south -- making it one of the oldest cities in the U.S. In the late 1700s, it was also one of America's wealthiest places. \"The Salem witch trials was one small event in the long history of the city,\" said Donna Seger, a history professor at Salem State University, noting that much of the city's wealth came from international trade, especially with East Asia. </p><p>   Salem is also home to the nationally respected Peabody Essex Museum, well known for its trove of maritime and Asian art. Yet, according to a recent survey conducted by Destination Salem, the local tourism bureau, more than 80% of tourists cited the 1692 witch trials as one of the main reasons for visiting; over 30% were interested in \"modern witches\" and 20% sought \"paranormal exploration.\" The public interest in witches and the occult has grown over the years, according to Kate Fox at Destination Salem. </p><p>   And sure enough, on the weekend I spent wandering around the compact downtown, it was tough to tell the street performers from the tourists. People posed for photos with a Jack Skellington (Tim Burton's Pumpkin King from \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\") on stilts and a Frankenstein stretched out on the operating table. Tourists walked around with witch-themed T-shirts and $30 witch hats. I met one group of friends who had flown in from Texas with their own costumes. Outside the International Monster Museum in Witch City Mall, I stumbled upon a psychic fair that I nearly mistook for a speed dating event. </p><p>   In 1692, some of the men and women accused of practicing the \"wicked arts\" of witchcraft were marched along what is now Essex Street on the way to Proctor's Ledge to be hanged. Today, the street is lined with museums, restaurants, souvenir shops and establishments like Crow Haven Corner, which Google Maps refers to as a metaphysical supply store. </p><p>   In the witch shops, I overheard customers ask which gemstones they should carry for career success or what spells might lead them to a soul mate, or which incense to burn to clear negativity. At the Witchery, on the waterfront, you can take a class in making brooms. You can participate in a seance at Omen, take a photo of your aura at Ascend Get Lifted or book a \"magical guided walking tour\" with one of the staff witches at Crow Haven Corner. At many of the shops, you can buy enough crystals, gemstones and candles to fill a pumpkin patch. </p><p>   Salem's witch-focused entrepreneurship is said to have started with Laurie Cabot, who opened Crow Haven Corner in 1971 (Ms. Stathopoulos bought the business in 1999). A year earlier, episodes of the TV series \"Bewitched\" were filmed in Salem, raising its national profile. In 1972, the Salem Witch Museum opened, dedicated to the subject's history. A few years later, then-governor Michael Dukakis named Ms. Cabot the Official Witch of Salem, further fueling the town's tourism trade. </p><p>   In the decades that followed, the witch business has become increasingly varied and profitable. Christian Day, who calls himself the world's most famous warlock (\"Do you know any others?\" he quipped), left his job in advertising in 2005. He now owns two shops on Essex Street, Hex and Omen (and two others in New Orleans). Hex sells haunted honey (gathered from graveyard beehives) and Clean House candles and incense, which Mr. Day said are especially popular with home sellers and realtors trying to banish negativity from homes on the market. </p><p>   \"The core of witchcraft is intent,\" he said. \"[Customers] buy these products because we want to make something happen in our lives.\" But there are limits. \"We don't curse people,\" said Lori Bruno, owner of the Magika shop and a self-described hereditary high priestess. Formerly, Ms. Bruno worked for NASA as an illustrator of technical drawings. </p><p>   Artemisia Botanicals, across the street from a statue of Salem author Nathaniel Hawthorne, specializes in \"green\" witchery, stocking more than 400 herbs, 100 teas, 75 essential oils, soaps, \"spell candles\" and a jar of \"graveyard dirt\" in the 800-square-foot retail space. </p><p>   Perhaps the most modern and chicest of the witch shops is HausWitch Home &amp; Healing, a light-filled space across from the stylish Merchant hotel. Owner Erica Feldmann, who sees witchcraft as an empowering feminist statement, started HausWitch in 2012 as an interiors blog. In 2015, the bricks-and-mortar store opened, selling a mix of Salem-themed decor like pillows adorned with black cats, and magic-themed items, including \"Salem moon drops\" (water reportedly charged by the full moon). The brand has a robust following on Instagram and, of course, #WitchTok. </p><p></p>",
