  "text": "<p>All three major U.S. indexes started Friday lower, but the buoyancy that has lifted them each by about 17% or more this year eventually resurfaced. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.1% in recent trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 65 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite edged up less than 0.1%.</p><p>Apple shares fell 2.5%, and Amazon.com shares retreated 2.7%. Together, the companies account for nearly 10% of the S&amp;P 500's market capitalization.</p><p>\"I think investors are taking [Apple and Amazon's earnings results] in stride because they've seen broader strength across the market\" during earnings season, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. \"You're seeing this quarter that corporate America is showing how adaptable it is.\"</p><p>Major indexes are on pace to close October with big gains. The S&amp;P 500 is up 6.8% this month, on pace for its largest monthly increase since November of last year. The Nasdaq Composite has climbed 6.9% month-to-date, while the Dow is up 5.7%.</p><p>Their performance marks a sharp turnaround from September, when stocks tumbled as fears about issues ranging from inflation to China's property market flared. But a strong earnings season and low volatility helped turn the U.S. stock market around in October. About 82% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far this season have beaten expectations for earnings, according to FactSet data from early Friday afternoon.</p><p>Throughout earnings season, companies across many sectors have warned about supply-chain and labor constraints. But many are also betting customers will keep paying higher prices.</p><p>Supply-chain problems are \"not a terrible thing for corporate profits,\" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse.</p><p>On Friday, the two largest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, reported their most profitable quarterly earnings since before the pandemic. Shares gained 0.4% and 1%, respectively.</p><p>Starbucks shares slid 7.2% after the coffee chain said its U.S. sales were strong, but the pandemic's resurgence in China had dragged on revenue.</p><p>Fresh data Friday showed that U.S. consumer spending grew more slowly in September, as the Covid-19 Delta variant and supply-chain disruptions weighed on households.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.1% for the day and 4.6% for the month. Shares of Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto maker controlled by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding, rose more than 20% from its initial public offering price when it started trading Friday in Stockholm.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.565% from 1.568% Thursday. Yields fall when prices rise.</p><p>Investors sold off eurozone government bonds after fresh data showed that inflation in the eurozone accelerated in October at the fastest pace since July 2008.</p><p>This came after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Thursday that investors were wrong to expect the ECB to increase interest rates next year in response to rising inflation. The selloff in bond markets this week suggests investors doubt the central bank's ability to hold that line.</p><p>\"The market was betting on the full credibility of the ECB, and is now having doubts,\" said Sebastien Galy, macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.</p><p>In Asia, stock indexes closed with mixed performance. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.8% for the day, but posted a 0.6% loss for the month. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.7% on a daily basis but rose 3.3% for the month. South Korea's Kospi declined 1.3% for the day and 3.2% for the month.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise, Shrugging Off Disappointing Earnings From Apple, Amazon</p>",
