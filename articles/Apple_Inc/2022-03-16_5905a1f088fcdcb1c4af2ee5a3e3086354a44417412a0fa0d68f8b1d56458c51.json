  "text": "<p>Mahatma Gandhi got three, Mark Zuckerberg had to make do with two. But a new Apple TV Plus series implies that Adam Neumann — the mercurial Israeli entrepreneur who built an empire of co-working spaces once valued at $47bn, only to come close to razing it himself — merits no fewer than eight hours of our attention. It's a tale of excess told in kind.</p> <p>There's only so much posturing, partying and profligacy one can take before it gets wearisome. That view was shared by the board at WeWork, who voted to oust Neumann from his own company in 2019, when the founder and chief executive was deemed too damaging to the business. At that time, WeWork was reportedly leaking <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e426c90-8c45-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972\">$219,000 an hour</a>.</p> <p>Each hour of <em>WeCrashed</em> is marked by a similar sense of waste. It's not that the show — which depicts how Neumann harnessed his outsized ego to turn a stuttering career into a global community with him at its centre — is poorly executed. There are slick montages, amusing exchanges and something to be said about seeing Jared Leto, one of the hammiest actors around, given the freedom to go whole-hog here as a man whose charlatanism many mistook for magnetism. But all this doesn't diminish the feeling that the series is an exercise in superfluity.</p> <p><em>WeCrashed</em> capitalises on a story that is having its moment, but it is ultimately too slight to be a source of fascination in years to come. This immediacy also means that the dramatisation has to compete with the real thing in real time. Why settle for Leto's imitation when you can have direct access to Neumann in revealing interviews, including one in this very newspaper?</p> <p>In fairness, <em>WeCrashed</em> does recognise the need to transcend the details recounted comprehensively elsewhere. It does so by devoting time to Neumann's stalkerish courtship of, and relationship with, his wife Rebekah Neumann (cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow). She's played by Anne Hathaway, who balances and tempers Leto's heavily-accented mania with a more restrained but no less defining form of vanity and aspiration. Often the couple appear to be talking directly in quotes lifted from motivational posters, but one crucial mantra missing from their repertoire of banalities is that “there's no I in team”. And for Neumann it's clear that there's no we in WeWork. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>Episodes 1-3 on Apple TV Plus from March 18</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'WeCrashed — Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway take on WeWork's excess' FT.com 16 March.
