  "text": "<p>And tech companies themselves, after years of resisting privacy legislation in many instances, have begun to push hard for a federal privacy standard -- which to many is preferable to a jumble of state laws, and might ease demands for antitrust legislation that could hit the companies even harder.</p><p>Kent Walker, president of global affairs for Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit, said Monday that there was an emerging consensus on the need for a comprehensive federal privacy policy.</p><p>Important policy hurdles still loom, and if agreement isn't reached within weeks, the effort could fall apart as partisan differences harden in the run-up to midterm elections.</p><p>Even so, Google is \"optimistic that Congress will find a compromise that adopts the nationwide privacy protections Americans want,\" Mr. Walker said in an address at R Street Institute, a think tank that says it promotes free markets and limited government.</p><p>Democratic and Republican leaders on both the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce are seeking to put guardrails on tech giants' collection, storage and use of consumers' personal information, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Under versions being considered, for example, consumers would be able to access their personal information with the option to make changes or deletions, or move the data to a different online platform, the people said.</p><p>Enabling consumers to opt out of sharing many types of data with third parties is also part of these deliberations, the people said. Protections against online discrimination -- for example, in targeted advertising related to housing or employment -- are also likely to be included, they said.</p><p>One selling point for the tech industry is that federal legislation is expected to supersede state laws, at least to some extent.</p><p>For example, four states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws -- California, Colorado, Utah and Virginia. But the states use different standards to set out what kinds of entities and data are exempt, said Jessica Rich, a former head of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, who is now at law firm Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP.</p><p>The trade group Technet, which includes Apple Inc., Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., which owns Facebook and Instagram, is lobbying for a federal privacy law and recently tweeted images of its members meeting with leading lawmakers, including Senate Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).</p><p>The group also met with Republicans including Sens. Steve Daines and Dan Sullivan, as well as Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>Mrs. McMorris Rodgers and Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, are also involved in crafting the privacy legislation.Their Democratic counterparts include Rep. Frank Pallone, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Senate Commerce Committee chairwoman.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
