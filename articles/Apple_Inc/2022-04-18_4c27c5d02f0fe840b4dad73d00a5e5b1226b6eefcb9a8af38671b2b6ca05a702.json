  "title": "Family & Tech: How to Use Social-Media Parental Controls --- Rule #1: No lying about the age of the child when setting up an account",
  "text": "<p>As you'll see, I wanted to draw up a guide for using the parental controls in the big four social media apps for teens: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat. First, two big takeaways:</p><p>DON'T: lie about your kids' ages when signing up for apps, or let them do it. All four apps contain default settings that provide protections based on the declared age of the user. If your child already has a fake-age account, you'll have to go in and turn on these protections yourself, where available. (And your kid can often deactivate them as soon as you walk away.)</p><p>DO: have ongoing conversations with your children about keeping safe online. Parental controls aren't perfect -- and kids can find ways around them.</p><p>With that in mind, here's what to know about social-media parental controls and how to use them:</p><p>YouTube</p><p>The YouTube Kids app has a high bar for content, but children outgrow it quickly, so YouTube developed supervised accounts for kids under 13 in the U.S.</p><p>Where to start: Search for an Oct. 25, 2021, post by James Beser on blog.youtube.</p><p>Default settings: YouTube makes video uploads private by default for accounts created by minors, so their videos can be seen only via direct link. Take-a-break and bedtime reminders are also on by default for these users, and autoplay is off.</p><p>Opt-in settings: Parents on either iOS or Android can give their kid a supervised account for YouTube viewing. A \"Supervised Experience\" video and help page explain how. You can also download Google's Family Link app, which lets you set screen-time limits on YouTube and other apps on your child's Android and Chrome devices, and to manage other online activities. (For YouTube alone, Family Link isn't required.) You can't create a supervised YouTube account for children over 13 unless you previously gave them a supervised Google account and you still manage it.</p><p>Supervised YouTube accounts offer three different content settings: One allows kids to watch channels approved for viewers 9 and older, with no live streams. The second grants access to channels deemed OK for youths 13 and up, including live streams. And the third option lets them watch anything that isn't labeled 18+. Parents can also block specific channels on supervised accounts.</p><p>For those 13 or older, parents can use restricted mode, which helps filter undesirable content, directly in the YouTube app or browser. You will have to do it wherever the child is logged in -- and your kids can undo it.</p><p>What's missing: A way for parents to block categories of content such as videos of kids playing videogames, or an easy way to make a list of approved channels or content categories.</p><p>What's next: YouTube said the company has nothing new to share yet.</p><p>TikTok</p><p>Amid concerns around TikTok's impact on teens, the video-sharing app offers some of the most comprehensive safety features, according to my own review and several safety experts I spoke with.</p><p>Where to start: Read TikTok's comprehensive Guardian's Guide.</p><p>Default settings: For teens ages 13 to 15, accounts are automatically set to private, which means no one can see their videos. Younger teens can change their account to public but their videos would be shown only to friends (people they follow who follow them back). TikTok says it won't suggest to other users the accounts of 13- to 17-year-olds unless they choose to enable that.</p><p>Direct messaging is unavailable for teens ages 13 to 15; it's also unavailable by default for 16- and 17-year-olds but they can change the setting to allow messaging with friends. Teens 13 to 15 don't receive push notifications from the app after 9 p.m., and those 16 to 17 don't receive push notifications after 10 p.m.</p><p>Additional default settings let parents determine who can interact with and comment on teens' videos.</p><p>TikTok also allows kids under 13 to be on the app, but in a more controlled environment, with videos curated for a young audience. These children can't upload videos, comment on others' videos, message other users or have followers.</p><p>Opt-in settings: With a TikTok account, parents can use TikTok's Family Pairing feature to limit the time their teens spend on TikTok, restrict age-inappropriate content and set messaging restrictions.</p><p>Parents can also determine whether their teen's account is private or public, if the teen's account can be recommended to others and who can comment on a teen's videos. The settings are passcode secured, so teens can't change them.</p><p>Even without Family Pairing enabled, parents can help teens set screen-time limits and restrict content through the app's digital well-being setting, though users can reverse those settings.</p><p>What's missing: A way for parents to block specific types of content that could be detrimental to their child. However. . .</p><p>What's next: A TikTok spokeswoman said the company is working on ways parents and other users can choose categories of content they don't want children to see, such as videos containing violence or profanity.</p><p>Instagram</p><p>Instagram added parental controls to the photo- and video-sharing app for the first time last month.</p><p>Where to start: Check out the new Family Center from parent company Meta Platforms Inc.</p><p>Default settings: For teens under 16, accounts are automatically private. When minors initially join, their account doesn't allow people they don't follow to tag or mention them in posts. Users over 21 can't send messages to minors who don't follow them. Instagram provides safety notices for teens to be cautious in conversations with adults who exhibit suspicious behavior, such as attempting to send a large number of friend requests or messages to people under 18.</p><p>Opt-in settings: Instagram now lets parents see how much time their teens spend on Instagram and to set time limits. (This could already be done with Apple or Google device screen-time controls.) Parents can also see who their teens follow and who follows their teens (which they could see anyway if they follow their teen or that account is set to public). In order for the tools to take effect, teens have to grant their parents access through the app.</p><p>What's missing: A way for parents to restrict the kinds of content their kids view, monitor what their kids like or comment on, or permanently disable direct messaging.</p><p>What's next: Starting in June, parents can request to supervise their teen's account through Instagram's app or website, but teens will still have to approve the request. Instagram will eventually let parents set specific hours during which children can use the app.</p><p>Snapchat</p><p>Snapchat is the only one of the big social-media apps that doesn't yet have parental controls. Yet its age-specific default settings can help protect kids -- so long as the kids use them.</p><p>Where to start: Read Snapchat's Parent's Guide.</p><p>Default settings: Most of the in-app safety protections for users 17 and younger are on by default. In order for two people to begin communicating, they have to be friends on the app. The app doesn't allow minors to show up as a friend suggestion to others, or to appear in a search unless they have friends in common.</p><p>Many parents are concerned about the Snap Map that shows peoples' location, but users have to opt in to share their location. If they do, teens can share their location only with friends. The stories minors share are set to be shared only with friends. No one under the age of 18 can create a public profile. You also can't see peoples' friend lists.</p><p>Opt-in settings: Snapchat's Friend Check Up feature annually prompts people to review their friend lists to make sure it's all people they know and still want to be connected with.</p><p>What's missing: For now, the app has no way for parents to see their kids' Snapchat friends.</p><p>What's next: This summer, Snapchat plans to roll out a Family Safety Center so parents can see who kids are connecting with on the app. Parents will need their own Snapchat accounts, and kids will have to grant parents permission. Parents still won't be able to see the messages their child sends or receives, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
