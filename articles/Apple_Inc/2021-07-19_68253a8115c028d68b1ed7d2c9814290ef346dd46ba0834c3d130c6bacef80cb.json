  "title": "The Navy's Troubles Are Long in the Making",
  "text": "<p>The fleet is half the size it was in the Reagan years, yet demands by regional commanders for naval forces are greater. Deployment time away from family is beyond tolerable. Long deployments leave insufficient time for maintenance and few ships are combat ready. Training has been slashed. Paperwork is pervasive. The most recent audit found that each ship and squadron is required to provide 750 reports annually, most of which are of no value.</p><p>Naval service has until recently been seen as an elite calling. Now many see it as just another trade. The bureaucracy has done away with officers' and chiefs' clubs, as well as bachelor officers' quarters. Except for senior officers, no one wants to live on base. Sailors commute to work like any civilian and socialize as far as possible from senior officers. Naval service when not deployed is today little different from working in the Postal Service.</p><p>Most pernicious is the zero-tolerance policy -- one mistake and you're out. One DUI, one anonymous accusation, and a fine, professional leader, mid-career, can be ruined. As the report notes, not one of the five-star naval leaders of World War II could have made admiral in today's woke Navy.</p><p>For all these frightening ills, the Navy will respond to leadership. But Carlos del Toro, the promising new Navy secretary, will need strong support. President Biden must be educated rapidly in the need to restore U.S. naval supremacy.</p><p>John Lehman</p><p>Washington Crossing, Pa.</p><p>Mr. Lehman was secretary of the Navy (1981-87).</p><p>---</p><p>The prime culprit here is the Navy's \"up or out\" system of promotion, implemented after World War II. The system is dominated by senior officers who pick favorites and give them excessively high ratings -- \"best in class\" has become routine -- knowing how the game is played at promotion boards. Officers rated merely \"very good\" are placed in the bottom half, are not promoted and are forced out of the service. If an officer makes a mistake, he is often weeded out and dismissed. Consequently, officers are motivated to take a cautious approach and play up to their supervisors.</p><p>The up-or-out system has produced several generations of lackluster naval leaders. A similar personnel system was instituted in the State Department for foreign-service officers, resulting in spineless bureaucrats permeating the higher ranks. Place the blame for the lack of courageous and competent officers where it belongs: on personnel systems in which polishing the apple of a supervisor is the only way to get promoted.</p><p>William Taylor</p><p>San Diego</p>",
