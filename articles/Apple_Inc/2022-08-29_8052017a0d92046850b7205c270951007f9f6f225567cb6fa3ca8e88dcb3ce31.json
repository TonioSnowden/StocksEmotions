The yuan recently dropped to its weakest level against the U.S. dollar in two years.</p><p>A downturn in the country's real-estate market, weak demand and cost pressures reduced profit in the iron-and-steel industry by 80.8% in the first seven months of 2022 from the year-earlier period, the statistics bureau said.</p><p>China's auto makers reported the steepest profit increase among all the surveyed industries because of factors including supply-chain recovery and a tax cut on vehicle purchases, the bureau said.
