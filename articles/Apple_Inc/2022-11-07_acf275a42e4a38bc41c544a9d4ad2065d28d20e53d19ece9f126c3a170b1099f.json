  "text": "<p>   Ensuring one's vote counts in a ranked-choice-voting (RCV) election requires ranking as many candidates as is conscionable (\"The 'Ranked Choice' Scam\" by Kimberley Strassel, Potomac Watch, Oct. 28). The voters whose ballots were discarded after the first round for only selecting Alaska's Nick Begich Jr. might as well not have voted. </p><p>   Pretending that RCV is an \"instant runoff\" misunderstands the strategy involved. Voters not only have to determine who they like best among the candidates, but also which \"backup\" candidates, if any, are acceptable to them and in what order. Repeat for five or six races, four candidates each. At some point, many voters lose patience. </p><p>   Participating in the \"instant runoff\" requires predicting in advance which candidates will make it to the final round of tabulation. By contrast, in a traditional runoff election voters can compare the final two head to head. </p><p>   The strategy of RCV is far more complicated and consequential than deciding among moose burgers, halibut and salmon for dinner. </p><p>   Sarah Montalbano </p><p>    Bozeman, Mont. </p><p>   Ms. Montalbano was a Robert L. Bartley Fellow at the Journal. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Ms. Strassel writes that before RCV Alaska had a \"perfectly good election system.\" I beg to differ. In Alaska's old system, like the current one in Pennsylvania, the general-election candidates are decided in partisan primaries by a small number of extreme voters. That is why in the current Pennsylvania Senate race we get to choose between a MAGA candidate and a socialist, neither of which appeals to me. </p><p>   In a ranked-choice system, Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat, and David McCormick, a moderate Republican would be on the ballot, and they would be my first two choices. There is a learning curve when changing systems, but we will get better choices. </p><p>   Richard Abraham </p><p>    Havertown, Pa. </p><p></p>",
