  "text": "<p>\n  Q: I love my car, but I hate its dated stereo. How hard is it to replace? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A: Easier than you might think! It should take you less than an afternoon to install a new receiver that will not only let you connect your phone through Bluetooth, but also support both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto software so you can easily use communication and navigation apps safely while driving. </p><p>\n  The Pioneer AVH-W4500NEX ($900, Crutchfield.com) is expensive, but worth it. It's got a huge, responsive touch screen, almost 7 inches diagonally, that makes interacting with the CarPlay and Android Auto menus simple and snappy. What's more, thanks to its Wi-Fi feature, you can use these without plugging your phone into your car via USB. Sounds like a minor perk, but you'll appreciate it on marathon errand days when you're constantly getting in and out of your auto. </p><p></p>",
