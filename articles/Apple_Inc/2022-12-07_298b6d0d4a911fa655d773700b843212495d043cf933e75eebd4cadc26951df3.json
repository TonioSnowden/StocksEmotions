  "text": "<p>Let's take a closer look at these small SUVs and find the right one for you.</p><p>2023 Honda HR-V</p><p>The Honda HMC HR-V was completely redesigned for the 2023 model year. The all-new HR-V is bigger than the one it replaced, with a more refined interior and upgraded cabin tech. Pricing starts at $23,800.</p><p>Honda HR-V highlights</p><p>Classy interior: Both of these models have handsome interiors. But the HR-V's feels a cut above its competition. A honeycomb line cuts the dash horizontally, adding a modern aesthetic where other subcompacts feel basic. Available leather seats include interesting stitching patterns. It's a more polished look than we're used to seeing in this class.</p><p>Rear seat room: Some small SUV buyers rarely use the rear seats. If you'll be carrying passengers in yours regularly, though, they'll appreciate that the HR-V has significantly more leg and shoulder room in the second row than the Corolla Cross. It's among the largest vehicles in its class now, and Honda used much of that space to be kind to rear-seat passengers.</p><p>Be sure to read: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds</p><p>Active noise cancellation: We expect to find active noise cancellation systems on higher-end cars. But they're arguably not needed there. In a class of cars this affordable, road and wind noise are more common. Honda uses a high-tech system to quiet them, and it shows.</p><p>2023 Toyota Corolla Cross</p><p>Everyone knows the Toyota Corolla name â€“it's history's best-selling nameplate. Last year, Toyota TM took advantage of that fact to introduce an all-new compact SUV smaller than its popular RAV4 wearing the Corolla Cross name. The 2023 Toyota Corolla Cross offers legendary Toyota reliability in a compact package with available all-wheel-drive. Pricing starts at $23,060.</p><p>Toyota Corolla Cross highlights</p><p>Better fuel economy: The Corolla Cross won't cost you much to own. Its 32 mpg combined beats the 28 of the HR-V. It doesn't get there by skimping on horsepower, either. The Toyota has 11 more than the Honda option. This year, a hybrid Corolla Cross becomes available with an estimated 37 mpg combined and 194 horsepower.</p><p>Wireless Apple CarPlay/Andriod Auto: Every trim level of Corolla Cross comes with standard wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay and Android Auto. The HR-V has them, too, but only on more expensive trim levels.</p><p>Rear seat vents: The HR-V may offer more rear seat room, but the Corolla Cross gives its second-row passengers A/C vents. Many automakers skimp on heating and cooling for the rear seats at this price point. Toyota includes a button to switch the rear-seat vents off if you're not carrying anyone back there.</p><p>Don't miss: This is now the cheapest new car in America, and one of a vanishing species</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Americans have debated whether Toyota or Honda offers better reliability and resale value for decades because both brands are fantastic at both. These are the smallest SUVs from the two most bulletproof brands on the market, and they have more in common than different.</p><p>Also see: When winter driving gets serious, should you get snow tires? Here's a guide.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The Honda HR-V and Toyota Corolla Cross both make outstanding choices. We're discussing small differences like a few inches of shoulder room and an extra vent to try to differentiate them because they're both solid, similar choices. We slightly prefer the interior styling of the HR-V, but you're not going to go wrong with either.</p><p>Specs </p><p>2023 Honda HR-V                     2023 Toyota Corolla Cross  Starting Price        $23,650                             $23,060  Popular Powertrains  Engine                2.0-liter I4                        2.0-liter I4  Horsepower            158 hp @ 6,500 rpm                  169 hp @ 6,600 rpm  Torque                138 lb-ft @ 4,200 rpm               150 lb-ft @ 4,400-4,800 rpm  Transmission          CVT                                 CVT  Fuel Economy          26 city/32 highway/28 combined mpg  31 city/33 highway/32 combined mpg  Also Available        AWD                                 AWD; hybrid  Specs  Basic Warranty        3 years/36,000 miles                3 years/36,000 miles  Powertrain Warranty   5 years/60,000 miles                5 years/60,000 miles  NHTSA Overall Safety  TBD                                 TBD  Max Seating Capacity  5                                   5  Wheelbase             104.5 inches                        103.9 inches  Overall Length        179.8 inches                        175.6 inches  Width                 72.4 inches                         71.9 inches  Height                63.4 inches                         64.8 inches  Turning Diameter      35.1 feet                           35.4 feet  Headroom, Front       39.4 inches                         39.5 inches  Headroom, Rear        38.0 inches                         39.1 inches  Legroom, Front        41.9 inches                         42.9 inches  Legroom, Rear         37.7 inches                         32.0 inches  Shoulder Room, Front  56.6 inches                         52.7 inches  Shoulder Room, Rear   55.2 inches                         52.4 inches  Cargo Volume          24.4/55.1 cubic feet                26.5 FWD/25.2 AWD</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com .</p><p>The 2023 Toyota Corolla Cross vs. the Honda HR-V: How do they compare?</p>",
