  "text": "<p>Tommy Lowther had an inside source when it came to buying a barn. The 38-year-old former soldier was looking for a house to suit his young family, but his wife wanted a place with land to keep horses. Then, last year, he received a tip-off from his mother-in-law.</p> <p>She told them about an old barn for sale in Butterknowle, seven miles north of Barnard Castle in north-east England. “We saw the place and 24 hours later put in an offer of £250,000 for some stones and some grass,” Lowther says.</p> <p>The 19th-century unconverted stone and brick agricultural building comes with a 17-acre site. Once they have developed the property — which Lowther expects to cost a further £150,000 — they also plan to use the land for a turkey farm, a livery business and a glamping site.</p> <p>For other people looking to buy a barn, particularly older barns, the search is much harder. Across the UK, be that the Cotswolds, Devon, the commuter belt of Buckinghamshire and Berkshire, or parts of the north, developers and estate agents are reporting that old unconverted barns are increasingly difficult to find.</p> <p>In Herefordshire, Tom Grant of estate agent Grant &amp; Co says, “Most barn conversions [now] are part of a complex; individual barns on their own are as rare as hen's teeth. They're not making any more of these barns and over the last 10 or 15 years, they've been converted.” In his area, he estimates that the availability of unconverted barns with planning permission — both individual and complex — has halved in the past 10 years.</p> <p>In Devon, there is a similar pattern. Ian Dennis of Dart Developments has converted about 100 traditional barns. He says: “Nearly all the nice barns in nice locations are converted now; they can only be done once.”</p> <p>He says that in 2000, an unconverted barn could be bought for about £60,000. Now the same barn would fetch about £300,000, something he attributes to scarcity.</p> <p>“If you went back 20 years ago, there were any amount of barns on the market that could remain unsold for long periods of time. You might have a few farmers who waited in excess of 10 years [to sell their barn]. Over time, they've become rarer as they have been sold and businesses have been buying them.”</p> <p>Rupert Sturgis, a partner in Knight Frank's Cirencester office, says that 10-15 years ago “I would probably get about four or five a year, but it's definitely slowing down; it's now near two or three a year.”</p> <p>Barns come up for conversion be­cause, as farm machinery has increased in size, they have become unsuitable as agricultural buildings. At the same time, conversions have grown popular as a style of modern living in the countryside. For farmers, unused barns present an opportunity to release capital.</p> <p>Some of these barns can be hundreds of years old, made of local stone, brick or timber, or elements of each. In the Cotswolds, for example, they tend to be made of Cotswold stone. Some were built by affluent wool-producing families centuries ago, with as much thought put into their design as into the family manor house.</p> <p>A barn conversion often involves rescuing a semi-derelict building, which might have timber supports exposed to the weather.</p> <p>Dennis says: “They are difficult to turn into a house. The roof will nearly always need replacing, as well as the timber, so all you're left with is the external walls, and often they will need underpinning because they won't have proper foundations.” He has spent “many millions” on the development of 14 units at Hareston Farm Barns near Yealmpton, Devon.</p> <p>However Colin Thomas, a builder who has done several barn projects in Herefordshire, says the main challenge is restoring the original structure.</p> <p>“The biggest job is getting it back to a state that can be converted; once you've achieved that it's very easy. The cost mainly is the labour, but it can vary tremendously.” The cost of materials can be less than one might imagine, he adds, because much is in place already.</p> <p>“It's probably got roof tiles, and 80 per cent of the tiles are there, but you've got to replace 20 per cent, whereas with a new build, you've got to buy them all.”</p> <p>He cites building costs of £1,400- £1,800 a sq metre, working on a typical barn space of 150-200 sq metres.</p> <p>Then there is obtaining planning permission to change the use of a building from agricultural to residential. Michael Bamford, a chartered town planner who works with Planning Design, says: “Many local planning policies support the change of use of barns to residential because they are historic buildings.</p> <p>“If [as a visitor] you're experiencing the history of an area, old barns contribute to that experience; by allowing change of use to a dwelling, that can protect the building more effectively than leaving it in vacant agricultural use.”</p> <p>The owner will need to prove that the barn is of sound structure and that any conversion contributes positively to the character of the area, he adds. If it is listed, then it is important to check which features are listed, whether internal or external, as these will need to be retained.</p> <p>Some councils are more sympathetic than others, however, as Dana Ford found. The 33-year-old IT project manager bought a timber 18th-century barn without planning permission in Braintree, Essex, in 2015.</p> <p>To get through planning, she had to prove that the barn was not wanted by the local business community by putting it back on the market for six months, for a fraction of the price she paid for it. She had paid £225,000, but was advised to market it at £120,000.</p> <p>“We weren't under any obligation to sell it but if somebody had offered £120,000, the council wouldn't have given us planning permission, and we would have been stuck with a hugely overpriced barn that we couldn't use.”</p> <p>When it comes to more modern barns, changes made to the planning laws in 2014 have released more potential conversions to the market. These are known as Class Q permitted development rights, and a building has to meet specific criteria: it must not be listed, nor in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, conservation area or national park. No external extensions are permitted and agriculture must have been its most recent use. A barn built after 2013 cannot be converted under Class Q rights for at least 10 years.</p> <p>According to figures published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, there were 1,060 conversions from agricultural to residential properties under permitted development rights in 2018/19, up from 740 the previous year.</p> <p>Nick Mills, managing director of David Burr Estate Agents, based in East Anglia, says: “Class Q permitted development rights has been a real game changer — there's been a real upturn in interest in these.” He used to see 15 to 20 old barns a year coming up for sale in his part of Suffolk. Thanks to Class Q, he says, the number of barns available there has doubled.</p> <p>However, it is not always a sure bet. Louise Newton, senior rural surveyor at Bidwells property consultants, says: “Permitted development rights are much harder to gain consent for than people realise. Between 40 or 50 per cent of all Class Qs nationally are refused. People often make the error of thinking it's an easy way to get a barn conversion but it's becoming increasingly difficult to go through a Class Q route.”</p> <p>So where are buyers likely to find unconverted barns?</p> <p>Many farmers will sell their barns through estate agents, and rural estate agents' websites are the obvious first place you should look. Another option is to recruit a buying agent who has local contacts and knowledge of the sector; he may be able to knock on farmers' doors and act as a go-between. And local architects might know of barns coming up for sale, having worked with owners on presale planning applications.</p> <p>One developer, Paul Bentley of Green Oak Developers, has taken to driving over the North York Moors looking for unused barns. He says: “They're mostly derelict. You have to find out who owns them, which often means posting through letterboxes, hoping someone will get in touch.” He also gets to hear about barns through word of mouth or through his company's website.</p> <p>Ultimately, location is likely to determine the cost and availability of a property. Architect David Nossiter says: “The barns in the south sell more quickly and are a lot more expensive.</p> <p>“There are fewer lovely unconverted barns left and the asking price is sometimes quite expensive for what is on offer. You do have to look around. The days of finding a beautiful old tithe barn to convert don't happen so much — you have to consider barns that were overlooked.”</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
