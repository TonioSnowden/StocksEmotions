  "text": "<p>Gene Johnson</p><p>Bethesda, Md.</p><p>Mr. Seminara is a Never Trumper who doesn't know it yet. He anticipates that the Republican Party may need a revolution. Sir, that has already happened. The party establishment has been replaced and the media unmasked. That bell cannot be unrung. Mr. Seminara is living in a fantasy land.</p><p>Peter McCarthy</p><p>Scarsdale, N.Y.</p><p>Mr. Seminara suggests he is part of a third segment of the Republican Party, somewhere in between Never Trumpers and Trump supporters. All I can say is good luck winning the White House with that microsegment.</p><p>The Seminaras of the world must have had selective hearing when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. In his final debate with Hillary Clinton, when pressed multiple times by moderator Chris Wallace on whether he would accept the election results, Mr. Trump made clear what he thought of elections: \"What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?\" Sadly, too few Republicans took Mr. Trump at his word.</p><p>Jim Triggs</p><p>Minneapolis</p><p>Mr. Seminara crystallized the thinking of so many in his article, including me. Sadly, I share his pessimism but still hold out hope that we're at a tipping point. We simply can't abide the violence in our streets, the failure in our schools and the utter disregard for civility. Time for some radical changes, first and foremost at the top.</p><p>Teri Bialosky</p><p>Studio City, Calif.</p><p>The Space Between Never Trump and MAGA</p>",
