  "title": "REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial):  Drunk on Theft in Oregon",
  "text": "<p>   Oregon has binged on lawlessness in recent years, and now the hangover is setting in. New data from the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission show a huge surge in the shoplifting of alcohol. </p><p>   In 2021 Oregon's liquor stores reported more than 459 incidents of shoplifting, up from some 266 in 2019, according to our analysis of state data. The trend continues this year as alcohol vendors had reported some 450 shoplifting incidents by the end of July. </p><p>   Portland accounts for more than half of the alcohol heists. Already this year its liquor stores have reported more than 275 shoplifting incidents by the end of July -- more than the entire statewide total in 2019. The state data show that Portland's thieves have pilfered more than $31,000 in alcohol so far this year. </p><p>    Dan Miner, the owner of two Portland liquor stores, says he often sees shoplifters shove liquor bottles down pant legs, tuck them inside coats, or stuff them in large purses. And \"I've had baby carriers used, with a blanket over it to hide [alcohol] -- no baby in it, of course,\" he says. But \"this year in particular, there's much more brazen activity where people don't even try to hide. They just grab the bottle and march out of the store.\" </p><p>   Oregon's lawbreakers have reason to feel emboldened. In the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, vandals and looters broke into Portland's Pioneer Place Mall, the Apple store, and other businesses. The state's elected officials responded to the riots with legislation that strictly limits when police can use tear gas and other force. </p><p>   Meanwhile, Portland slashed its 2021 police budget by some $27 million. The city also reduced its authorized sworn police force from 1,001 in 2019 to 882 in 2021. Frustrated with the lack of political support, officers resigned and retired in masse, and the police bureau currently has some 108 vacancies that it's struggling to fill. </p><p>   The Portland Police Bureau has had to triage its response to crime and encourages theft victims to report the crime online instead of calling 911. \"I have never received a follow-up call or a visit for shoplifting,\" Mr. Miner says. In Oregon, theft of goods worth less than $1,000 is a mere misdemeanor. Thieves are clearly drunk on their impunity. </p><p></p>",
