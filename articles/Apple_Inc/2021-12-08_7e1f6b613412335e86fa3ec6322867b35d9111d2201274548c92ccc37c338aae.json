  "text": "<p>Good evening from London,</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94636129-58f1-4972-ac1c-6283ff8ff447\">exclusive FT poll</a> today underlines how rapidly expectations for the US economy have shifted in the past few months, as leading economists forecast the Federal Reserve will end its pandemic bond-buying programme by the end of March and raise interest rates soon after.</p> <p>The survey reflects the tougher stance against inflation taken by Fed chair Jay Powell and his colleagues in recent weeks. “The combination of the high inflation rate and the tight labour market suggests that there is no need for strongly expansionary Fed policies like [bond] purchases,” said Jonathan Parker, a professor of financial economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “To send the signal that [they] are normalising policy is important.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The impact of the pandemic on jobs was also noted by many respondents who believe it will be some time — if at all — before the economy returns to pre-crisis levels of employment. However, Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, speaking at the <a href=\"https://globalboardroom.ft.com/\">FT Global Boardroom</a> event yesterday, said she saw no reason why the combination of a tight labour market and rising prices would lead to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91cab445-90fa-4f08-bbaa-ea68ef9487c7#post-99d1391e-763e-4c34-b366-efd401d71fa9\">wage-price spiral</a>.</p> <p>The role of central bank stimulus is also under the spotlight in Europe, where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c68f6d8-520a-4219-a31c-dc054087ff65\">ECB policymakers</a> are reassessing their commitments as the emergence of the Omicron variant threatens to fuel inflationary pressures that they had insisted for months were temporary.</p> <p>EU member states are also currently discussing how to amend the bloc's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fefcfaa6-4ceb-4fd3-b3ce-ccabe8b5470a\">fiscal rules</a> in the Stability and Growth Pact, which was suspended during the crisis. Christian Linder, Germany's new finance minister, appears to be open to reform, stressing the need for&#xa0;stability but combined with “growth and investment”, while Mario Draghi, Italy's prime minister, has said reform of the rules was “inevitable”.</p> <p>Economics editor Chris Giles praises the swift action of policymakers during the pandemic, in his new analysis of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e965173e-ec0f-4fae-a221-72eb696fc313\">lessons learned from Covid</a>.</p> <p>Strict lockdowns, robust vaccination campaigns and generous fiscal support for individuals and businesses mean advanced economies will have recovered all of the lost ground by the end of 2022, according to the OECD, compared with its November 2019 forecasts, making “build back better” not a hollow slogan but the most likely outcome.</p> <p>The key lesson, Giles concludes, is this: You can't separate economics from epidemiology.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The head of the Port of Los Angeles, the biggest in the US, said supply-chain disruptions were likely to take until at least the end of next year to subside (Bloomberg)</p></li>  <li><p>UK energy supplier EDF called for the government's tax windfall from higher electricity and gas bills to be given to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29862b50-ccef-454f-9a1e-b498d66e2124\">struggling households</a></p></li>  <li><p>Austria's government ordered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14f57e05-78ef-4c6a-aeaa-da1bf99670e1#post-0b213730-c454-4daa-b355-58207e382ac5\">hospitality venues</a> at ski resorts to stay closed indefinitely, even as it moves to reopen public life following a three-week emergency lockdown</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14f57e05-78ef-4c6a-aeaa-da1bf99670e1\"><em>live blog</em></a><em> and to listen to the latest news in less than three minutes, </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/top-stories-today\"><em>click here</em></a><em> for our Top Stories Today audio digest.</em></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The FT revealed that the <strong>UK government</strong> was set to introduce <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd0a637e-3e2b-4637-9548-d9eac1e20838\">new restrictions</a> to curb the spread of the <strong>Omicron variant</strong>, sending the pound down to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2c6706f-a7ca-4a3d-81a2-bba84e11127f\">2021 low</a>, while business groups warned of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14f57e05-78ef-4c6a-aeaa-da1bf99670e1#post-f949ea1e-3320-4aac-8e93-0f85f8f10118\">“body blow”</a> to the hospitality industry.</p> <p>Germany's parliament today formally elected <strong>Olaf Scholz</strong> as chancellor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9780b4c6-2b9e-49d7-afce-20fc6e8cef81\">to replace Angela Merkel</a> in a new three-party ruling coalition. Here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a32b2f0d-5085-4088-b11d-1def2b615413\">five challenges</a> for his new government. </p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>The<strong> Black Friday</strong> shopping frenzy has now become a month-long affair in the UK, according to the British Retail Consortium. Britons this year splashed out on clothing, toys and jewellery as well as spending in bars and restaurants, lifting sales for the month by an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0b144b0-260e-4e69-920f-bd71ba587d81\">annual rate of 5 per cent</a>, up from 1.3 per cent the previous month.</p> <p>Legal rows could mean delays in <strong>EU recovery funds</strong> for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9137780a-3b6b-4b92-a6d5-da29941183c2\">Poland and Hungary</a>. Brussels wants both countries to sign up to a set of reforms before the money is disbursed. The bloc's <strong>health ministers</strong> are meeting today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d08a1d8e-878b-4ff8-b1e4-d7b56c9ec0ac\">pandemic measures</a>.</p> <p>Official data on <strong>alcohol-related deaths</strong> in the UK during the pandemic make for some grim reading and raise wider concerns about people's wellbeing and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91cab445-90fa-4f08-bbaa-ea68ef9487c7#post-758afcc3-a7e7-4fc3-8f3f-ed4567287dfd\">effect of lockdown restrictions</a>. Alcohol-specific causes killed nearly 9,000 people in 2020, an 18.6 per cent increase compared with 2019 and the highest annual increase since records began in 2001. The figures are also in sharp contrast with contractions in 2019 and 2018.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p><strong>Japan's economy</strong> shrank by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4605ad4e-e21e-475c-a415-582692795e0f\">faster than expected 3.6 per cent</a> in the third quarter due to a drop in consumer spending amid a summer surge in Covid-19 cases. The steep fall in consumption raises fears that the situation could repeat itself if there is a surge in infections from the Omicron variant.</p> <p><strong>Coffee prices</strong> have hit a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41251b3f-4ef8-4000-9299-df19fffd1c9c\">10-year high</a> due to shipping bottlenecks and weather issues such as drought in Brazil and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c745f2b9-1cbc-4f59-9f21-b4f7c75d9e60\">La&#xa0;Niña phenomenon</a>. The jump in bean prices has also led to hoarding by farmers, constraining exports and adding to the upward pressure on prices.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong>'s economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91cab445-90fa-4f08-bbaa-ea68ef9487c7#post-5679736b-f81b-48a0-a03b-7e174c2b4d9d\">shrank 1.5 per cent</a> in the third quarter — the first time in a year — as the country was gripped by political violence. Manufacturing, trade and farming activity in Africa's most industrialised economy all fell and exports dropped 6 per cent.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p><strong>Apple</strong> is facing a nightmare before Christmas, reveal our colleagues at <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/Apple-s-nightmare-before-Christmas-Supply-chain-crisis-delays-gift-deliveries\">Nikkei Asia</a>, as for the first time in more than a decade iPhone and iPad assembly was halted for several days due to supply chain problems and power restrictions. The company is millions of units short of its production targets and in many countries it is now too late for consumers to buy products in time to give as holiday gifts.</p> <p>There was, however, some positive news for manufacturing in Asia as <strong>Lego</strong>, the world's biggest toymaker, announced an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fc91e52-c377-40f9-beae-9e6ad267590e\">investment of $1bn in Vietnam</a> to cater for growing local demand and make its supply chain more resilient.</p> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> said it would carry out on-site inspections of banks with high exposures to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91cab445-90fa-4f08-bbaa-ea68ef9487c7#post-fb01b271-64f3-461f-bc50-e35a7925a758\">riskier activities</a> to check how they would be hit by a rise in interest rates. The announcement was part of a three-year plan for its banking supervisory unit, which oversees the biggest 113 eurozone lenders.</p> <p><strong>Tui</strong>, Europe's largest tour operator, said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47523072-c6fc-4887-9d5d-d4897f1fb70f\">winter bookings had been dented</a> by the spread of the Omicron variant. ABTA, the travel trade body, said the reintroduction of pre-departure testing for people entering the UK, Tui's second-largest market after Germany, was “a huge blow to travellers and an already devastated travel industry”.</p> <p><strong>Lloyd's List</strong>, the shipping publication launched almost three centuries ago, is being sold by Informa as part of a reorganisation that leaves the media and events group betting on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f664aef-ffd4-450b-9cb4-4cabd27d44b9\">recovery in corporate conferences</a> after the collapse in physical gatherings during the pandemic.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>Is the golden era of the <strong>gig economy</strong> over?
