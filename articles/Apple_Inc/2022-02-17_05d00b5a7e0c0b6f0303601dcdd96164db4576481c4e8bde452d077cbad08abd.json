  "text": "<p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>\"Severance,\" Apple TV+'s new thriller, opens with the sight of a woman lying on a conference room table. She doesn't know her name or where she is. It occurs to her that she might be in hell. She is actually an employee of a secretive, sprawling corporation called Lumon Industries.</p><p>To accept certain positions at Lumon, employees must agree to undergo a procedure called \"severance\" that separates all memory and knowledge of their personal life when they are at work, and vice versa. The procedure creates not just a kind of disjointed work-life balance, but the creation of two lives: one at home, and one at work. At home, for example, Mark Scout (Adam Scott), the show's central character, is still grieving the death of his wife. At the office, he doesn't know that he is a widower. If he is fired from his job, that life—and his memory of co-workers such as John Turturro's Irving—basically ends.</p><p>\"It was really important to us that it be the same guy. But one of them has 40-odd years of life experience and is grieving his wife and has all of this baggage,\" Mr. Scott said in an interview over Zoom. \"The other is clean and is, for all intents and purposes, just a couple of years old. He carries a lot of these feelings and emotions with him but doesn't recognize what they are.\"</p><p>The series is executive produced by Ben Stiller, who also directed most of the episodes. Mr. Stiller notes \"Severance\" isn't a \"comedy, comedy.\" But it has elements of the classic workplace comedy in its DNA. For example, the more intense things get for Mr. Turturro's character, he says, the funnier he gets.</p><p>\"That's the kind of humor that I like,\" says Mr. Stiller. \"And I think there's a lot of work out there now that is crossing genres and not worrying about identifying one way or another.\"</p><p>\"Severance\" premieres Friday on Apple TV+.</p><p>'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'</p><p>(Prime Video)</p><p>By the start of the fourth season of \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" it is 1960 and the homemaker-turned-stand-up-comic Miriam \"Midge\" Maisel is back in New York after traveling the world as the opening act for one of the biggest stars on Earth. Now she has fresh ideas about how to succeed as a comedian. As the central character (Rachel Brosnahan) in one of Amazon's marquee titles begins to find her voice, so do the characters that surround her.</p><p>Alex Borstein's Susie Myerson has made the jump from club employee to talent manager and creative confidante. Miriam's ex-husband, Joel (Michael Zegen), has progressed from immature husband and wannabe comic to entrepreneurial founder of a nightclub and supportive co-parent. And Miriam's father, Abe Weissman (Tony Shalhoub), has gone from Columbia professor with a university-provided apartment to theater critic at The Village Voice.</p><p>\"So often in a successful series, you can get painted into a corner, and any one character can just sort of serve a certain function, and you're called on to do one or two things repeatedly,\" says Mr. Shalhoub, who has won an Emmy for his portrayal of Abe. \"Whereas these characters…get to have massive changes and reinvent themselves. And that's a luxury, because you never know what's coming down the pike, and you never get painted into a corner,\" he says.</p><p>​​Season four of \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" premieres Friday on Amazon's Prime Video.</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>—The Gentrification Massacre: In the new \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"—a sequel to the 1974 \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\"—a group of young idealists has big plans for a small, (mostly) empty Texas town. Leatherface isn't pleased. The film streams Friday on Netflix.</p><p>—The Office: Steve Carell's latest workplace comedy, \"Space Force,\" returns for a second season, Friday, on Netflix.</p><p>—The Kanye Trilogy: The first in a three-part documentary about the life of Kanye West, \"jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy,\" is streaming now on Netflix.</p><p>—The Spoils of Capitalism: Carl Icahn gets the HBO Documentary treatment in \"Icahn: The Restless Billionaire,\" which chronicles the rise of Wall Street's most feared investor.</p><p>—The \"Yellowstone\" Universe Expands. The fifth season of the hit series \"Yellowstone\" will be split into two seven-episode parts when it returns this summer and will be used as a jumping-off point for new series, including a prequel called \"1932.\" The prequel series \"1883\" is already streaming on Paramount+.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately?</p><p>What to Watch: Seven Series and Movies to Stream This Week</p>",
