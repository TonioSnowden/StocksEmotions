  "title": "Pfizer, FedEx, Nike: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news",
  "text": "<p>Alphabet Inc.</p><p>Google is making a big purchase in the Big Apple. The Alphabet unit said on Tuesday it is buying a Manhattan office building for $2.1 billion, a clear signal of Big Tech's growing appetite for office space even as it embraces remote work. The deal for the new building on Manhattan's West Side is the most expensive sale of a single U.S. office building since the start of the pandemic. Google has said it envisions a hybrid workplace, and its office purchase underscores how the company views office space in its long-term strategy. Alphabet shares added 0.5% Tuesday.</p><p>FedEx Corp.</p><p>FedEx delivered a drop in profit thanks to the tight labor market. The logistics giant on Tuesday posted an 11% decline in profit for the recent quarter as labor shortages added $450 million to costs, including increased overtime, higher wages to attract workers and extra spending on transportation. The company is raising wages, paying premiums for weekend shifts and adding more than a dozen automated sorting facilities. Meanwhile, problems across the supply chain have dented demand for shipping packages. Online sales are also taking a hit as more people shop in store or pick up their online orders themselves. FedEx shares lost 9.1% Wednesday.</p><p>ConocoPhillips</p><p>ConocoPhillips is betting big on American oil. The energy producer on Monday announced its $9.5 billion purchase of Royal Dutch Shell PLC's assets in the Permian Basin. Competition to consolidate is reshuffling the pecking order among top U.S. shale drillers, and ConocoPhillips' purchase means it will overtake all but Exxon in oil and gas output in the contiguous U.S. The company has been among the biggest spenders in the recent consolidation wave, also closing a $9.7 billion purchase of Permian oil producer Concho Resources Inc. in January. ConocoPhillips shares gained 4% Tuesday.</p><p>Netflix Inc.</p><p>\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is coming to Netflix. The streaming giant said on Wednesday it has agreed to buy Roald Dahl Story Co. as it looks to stock up on content amid rising competition. By acquiring the U.K.-based company that controls the rights Mr. Dahl's popular children's stories and characters, Netflix aims to produce animated and live-action films, TV shows, games and other products based on his creations. It's the latest bet by a streaming service that exclusive content can be a golden ticket that will resonate with subscribers. In May, Amazon.com Inc. bought MGM Studios for $8.45 billion, describing its catalog as a \"treasure trove\" that would bolster Amazon's offering to viewers. Netflix shares rose 3.1% Wednesday.</p><p>Darden Restaurants Inc.</p><p>Olive Garden doesn't want its pasta prices to boil over. The chain's parent company, Darden Restaurants, said Thursday that it expects sales this year to outperform pre-pandemic levels but continues to feel pressure from inflation and staffing constraints. Raising prices on entrees, however, isn't necessarily the easy way out to offset higher costs, as Darden is being \"very cautious\" in its pricing decisions, Chief Executive Eugene Lee said. Big food makers and restaurant chains have said they are raising prices, cutting their own costs and trying other strategies to offset higher expenses. Darden shares rose 6.1% Thursday.</p><p>Nike Inc.</p><p>Nike can't outrun the pandemic. The sneaker giant on Thursday said production problems in Asia and trans-Pacific shipping delays are weighing on sales. Nike finance chief Matthew Friend said the company lost 10 weeks' worth of production in Vietnam because of lockdowns there after a surge in Covid-19 cases. More than half of Nike's footwear and about a third of its apparel manufacturing occurs in Vietnam, where local authorities recently extended a lockdown until at least Oct. 1. Mr. Friend said it was taking an average of 80 days to move products from Asia to North Americaâ€”twice as long as before the pandemic. Nike shares lost 2.6% Friday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Pfizer, FedEx, Nike: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
