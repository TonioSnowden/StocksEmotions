  "text": "<p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 fell 194 points, or 0.6%, to 34,162.</p><p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 declined 29.50 points, or 0.8%, to 4,003.</p><p>* Nasdaq 100 futures NQ00 were down 82.50 points, or 0.7%, at 11,700.25.</p><p>The Dow DJIA saw a 1.8% rise last week, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX advanced 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 0.7%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Wall Street is in line to start the week in a downbeat mood as traders absorb the impact of unrest in China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng HK:HSI tracked U.S. futures lower, losing 1.6%.</p><p>\"Unprecedented waves of protest in China have caused ripples of unease across financial markets, as worries mount about repercussions for the world's second-largest economy,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p>\"As demonstrations spread across the country from Beijing to Xinjiang and Shanghai, reflecting rising anger about the zero-Covid policy, a sustained recovery in demand across the vast country appears even further away,\" Streeter added.</p><p>Those concerns about waning demand in China delivered weakness in industrial commodities, with copper HG00 off 0.8% to $3.597 a pound and U.S. crude oil CL.1 erasing its 2022 gain.</p><p>\"China is a rapacious consumer of global commodities and signs economic activity is being disrupted by the mounting dissent in the country will be seen as negative for demand. It's worth noting that unrest is already affecting business in China including Apple which has seen violent clashes at one of its facilities in Zhengzhou,\"\"sais Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.</p><p>Shares in Apple Inc. AAPL were down 1.3% amid reports it could suffer a production shortfall of 6 million iPhone pros.</p><p>The prospect of unrest in China negatively impacting global growth is helping underpin government bond markets, with the 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y falling 4.4 basis points to 3.644%.</p><p>That sees the benchmark bond yield near its lowest level in 10 weeks, also forced down by hopes the Federal Reserve will start slowing the pace of its interest rate rises as inflation cools.</p><p>However, news over the weekend about strong festive-season retail sales suggest there are few signs that consumers are yet to buckle under the Fed's tighter policy.</p><p>\"U.S. shoppers spent more than $9 billion in online sales on Friday, and Cyber Monday is also expected to be a record-breaking one, with more than $11 billion to be spent,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.</p><p>\"This is not exactly what you expect to hear when you think that the U.S. will enter a consumer-led recession in couple of weeks from now,\" she added.</p><p>Further information about the health of the U.S. economy will come thick and fast this week, including home prices data and a consumer confidence index on Tuesday; the ADP employment report, the revision to third quarter GDP and the Fed's Beige Book on Wednesday; manufacturing PMIs and the personal consumption measure of inflation on Thursday; topped off with the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.</p><p>U.S. stock futures slide as China unrest raises growth fears</p>",
