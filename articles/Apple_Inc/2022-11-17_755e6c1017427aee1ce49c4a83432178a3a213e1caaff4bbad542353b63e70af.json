  "text": "<p>Produced on the Portuguese island of Madeira, the wine of the same name comes as close to immortality as any in the world. Incredibly, even an open bottle of Madeira can be enjoyed for decades. Mannie Berk, founder of Rare Wine Co., has an 1802 Madeira in his cellar that he opened 25 years ago. \"It's still great!\" he reported. This delicious 2001 bottling, rich and warm with luxurious caramel tones, is one for the ages. 2001 D'Oliveiras Boal Madeira, $150, RareWineCo.com</p><p>This Framed Print Confers Instant Fabulousness</p><p>If your giftee is the sort who would have loved clinking Martinis with Manhattan's literati at the late, lamented Elaine's, the Instagram account @matchbookdiaries is a gift in itself. It documents striking strikers, largely from legendary bars and restaurants, collected by photographer Charles Ryan Clarke. Bestow some of that timeless glamour (in a gift you can actually wrap) with a fabulous, framed 8-by-12 or 10-by-12 print of one of Mr. Clarke's matchbook photos. The Original Matchbook Print, $175, CharlesRyanClarke.com</p><p>What Any Cook Mad About Saffron Needs</p><p>Saffron's aroma is fleeting, but this timeless tool, designed expressly to grind the world's costliest spice, will endure. The mortar and pestle remains the best technology for getting maximum flavor out of the red-gold stigmas of the saffron crocus. A collaboration between Seattle's Madisonware Ceramics and Villa Jerada, purveyor of Moroccan and Levantine pantry products, this ceramic version comes in a kit with a 1-gram tin of Moroccan saffron. Saffron Mortar &amp; Pestle Kit, $52, VillaJerada.com</p><p>Heirloom-Variety Fruits and Nuts for Discerning Snackers</p><p>Ah, the season of cut-glass dishes filled with festive snacks, ready to extend holiday hospitality to any visitor, caroler or portly red-suited gentleman who might show up. Pass on this tradition with the gift of dried fruits and nuts from Ziba, a company committed to an ethical supply chain and the proliferation of delicious heirloom varieties. This variety pack ranges from two types of heirloom almonds to the coveted Afghan kishmish raisins, known as \"the gummy bear raisin.\" Variety Pack, $57 for 7 (5 ounce) bags, ZibaFoods.com</p><p>The Cocktail Coupes to Toast With This Season</p><p>Stacked into a tower or imprinted with a saucy red lipstick pucker, these cherry-blossom-pink coupes from Kuwaiti homeware brand Ecru look like a hand-me-down from your great-grandmother, if your great-grandmother was Dorothy Parker. Made in India, the glasses flaunt a pretty hand-etched star pattern that confers considerable sparkle on any cocktail or bubbly contained therein. The vibe is most certainly vintage, in a particular bon-mot-slinging, jumping-in-a-fountain-in-your-tuxedo kind of way. Pink Star Coupes Set of Four, $120, EcruOnline.in </p><p>The Only Peeler a Kitchen Will Ever Need</p><p>Kitchenware brand Material is waging a determined campaign against throw-away culture, one beautiful, extremely durable item at a time. This stainless steel U-shaped peeler comes in a bronze finish that gives it the patina of a well-burnished treasure. The sharp, dishwasher-safe blade makes for superlatively smooth peeling. Perhaps the best part: That blade is also replaceable, making this a tool that can pass from kitchen to kitchen for years to come. The Forever Peeler in Bronzed, $28, MaterialKitchen.com</p><p>A Stockpot Sturdy Enough to Feed Several Generations</p><p>The artisans at Netherton Foundry in Shropshire, England, make hand-spun, black-iron cookware inspired by the region's 18th- and 19th-century iron masters. Launched in collaboration with cult British brand Toast, this sturdy, stately stockpot takes stovetop soups, stews and curries as well as saucy oven roasts in its stride. Pre-seasoned with flax oil, the naturally non-stick surface thrives in high-temperature cooking. The beautiful, bulletproof construction will see this pot through many, many iterations of family recipes as they're passed down. Toast x Netherton Foundry Iron Stockpot, $145, US.Toa.st</p><p>An Enduringly Chic Corkscrew</p><p>With this highly collectible, accordion-style corkscrew in hand, you're Colette in her salon in the Palais Royal, you're Gerald Murphy entertaining guests on the Riviera. Patented by Frenchman Jules Bart in 1919 and long the quarry of flea-market hunters, the Zig Zag's nickel-plated-steel design provides the leverage necessary to extract a cork with enviable savoir-faire. This model, made from original 1920s molds, keeps the tradition alive. Even the box it comes in is pure retro chic. Zig Zag Corkscrew, $75, WatsonKennedy.com</p><p>A Whiskey Worth Waiting For</p><p>To be labeled \"Bottled in Bond,\" a whiskey must be the product of a single distillation season, among other regulations laid out back in 1897. At Cascade Hollow Distilling Co. in Tullahoma, Tenn., general manager and distiller Nicole Austin returned to barrels from fall 2008 to create this bottling, a complex take on the famously smooth profile of George Dickel \"whisky\" (they spell it the Scottish way), with delicious fruit and nut notes and impressive structure. George Dickel Bottled in Bond Fall 2008, Aged 13 Years, $45, GeorgeDickel.com</p><p>SPLURGE: Grow Baby Greens Year Round With This Ingenious System</p><p>Cultivate a craving for heirloom produce year round with this compact indoor grow system. Under the full-spectrum LED grow light, baby greens shoot up fast, from seed to plate in 7-12 days. Made from powder-coated steel and food-grade high-density polyethylene (HDPE), the design looks sleek on a countertop, too. Seeds for everything from arugula to sunflower sprouts are sold separately, in individual packs, bundles, and subscriptions of one, two or three \"grows\" per month. The Fieldhouse in Sod, $295, GrowLeath.com</p><p>WHAT HEIRLOOM MEANS TO ME </p><p>To celebrate timeless gifts, we asked Jing Gao, founder of Fly by Jing, what treasure she values most.</p><p>\"For me, 'heirloom' can come from outside your family, outside your culture, but still be so valuable. Kayanoya—the 128-year-old Japanese seasoning brand—is something I am always happy to pass along to friends and family. My personal favorites: the vegetable dashi powder; dashi-infused umami salt; and yuzu fruit preserve. I first discovered these through a Japanese friend while in Tokyo almost a decade ago and would mule back packets of dashi powder from every trip to Japan. I was so pleased to see that they recently started selling online in the U.S.\"</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
