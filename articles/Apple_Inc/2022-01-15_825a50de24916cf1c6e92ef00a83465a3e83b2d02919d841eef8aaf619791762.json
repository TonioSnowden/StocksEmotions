  "text": "<p>Messrs. Howard and Grazer will remain shareholders, and Imagine's executives will continue to steer the studio's creative output, some of the people said. Merchant bank Raine Group will also continue to own shares, some of the people said.</p><p>The talks with Centricus might not result in a deal.</p><p>Other suitors have also expressed interest in Imagine, some of the people said.</p><p>A flurry of deal-making has swept Hollywood in recent months as companies cash in on the demand for films and TV shows for emerging streaming services. Village Roadshow Entertainment Group, a film- and television-financier with credits including \"Joker\" and \"The Matrix,\" is exploring strategic options including taking on a significant investment or selling itself, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.</p><p>Vine Alternative Investments, a private-equity firm that is the controlling shareholder of Village Roadshow, has tapped investment bank PJT Partners and has held talks with potential suitors, the Journal reported.</p><p>One milestone for the industry came in August when Candle Media agreed to acquire Hello Sunshine, the media company founded by Reese Witherspoon, for about $900 million.</p><p>Since then, several companies have sold outright or taken on new investors, including Westbrook Inc., the media company co-founded by Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith; AGBO, the media company co-founded by \"Avengers: Endgame\" directors Joe and Anthony Russo; and SpringHill Co., the media company co-founded by NBA star LeBron James.</p><p>Candle Media last year agreed to purchase Moonbug Entertainment, the creator of children's show \"CoComelon,\" for more than $2.75 billion.</p><p>Founded in 1985, Imagine Entertainment has produced award-winning films and TV shows that span genres including drama, comedy and documentaries. Imagine's projects have been recognized with Academy Awards, Golden Globes and dozens of Emmy Awards, according to the company's website.</p><p>Imagine has also invested in Jigsaw Productions, the media company founded by filmmaker Alex Gibney, and Jax Media, the film and TV producer co-founded by Tony Hernandez and Lilly Burns.</p><p>An acquirer could continue to license Imagine's library of movies and shows to distributors to generate cash. Some of the content Imagine has produced is already licensed to distributors including Netflix Inc., Apple Inc. and Walt Disney Co., which could affect the company's value to an acquirer.</p><p>However, Imagine has co-financed more of its projects in recent years and co-owns some of its productions, including the documentary \"Lucy &amp; Desi.\"</p><p>The company generates more than $30 million in cash annually, some of it from profit participation in its movies and TV shows, people familiar with its finances said. The company's annual revenue couldn't be learned.</p><p>Recent Imagine fare includes \"Tick, Tick . . . Boom!\", a film adaptation of \"Rent\" creator Jonathan Larson's autobiographical musical that was directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p><p>Founded in 2016, London-based Centricus is a relatively low-profile investment and advisory firm that is operated by former executives of Deutsche Bank.</p><p>With $40 billion in assets under management, it looks at investments in sectors including consumer, media, entertainment and sports.</p><p>The firm's track record has been in connecting Middle East money with investment opportunities in the West.</p><p>Last year it held talks with UEFA, European soccer's governing body, over financing worth 6 billion euro, equivalent to $6.9 billion, and in 2020 the firm made a long-shot bid for TikTok, the popular video-sharing app.</p><p>Centricus also helped establish the Vision Fund, a $100 billion investment vehicle launched by SoftBank Group Corp.</p><p>Centricus teamed with SoftBank in 2018 for its $25 billion bid to launch new tournaments for FIFA, soccer's international governing body, and create a streaming and entertainment platform for it.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
