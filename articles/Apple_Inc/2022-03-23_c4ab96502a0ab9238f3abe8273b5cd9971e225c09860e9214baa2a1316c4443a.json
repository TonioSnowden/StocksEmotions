  "text": "<p>The NYSE FANG+ XX:NYFANG index has slumped 11% this year.</p><p>Doug Kass, the president of Seabreeze Partners Management, proposes a new FAANG: F for fuel, one A for agriculture, another A for aerospace (as in aerospace and defense), N for nuclear and G for gold and critical metals.</p><p>These all are plays that have benefited from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions that have sent commodity prices surging and the world scrambling to wean itself from Russian supplies.</p><p>A MarketWatch-compiled average of his new FAANG assets, equal weighted using popular exchange traded funds, yields a 27% return for 2022.</p><p>Kass says he's long the GLD GLD exchange-traded fund and has invested in stocks in the other sectors, and expects supply/demand imbalances to keep boosting these themes.</p>",
