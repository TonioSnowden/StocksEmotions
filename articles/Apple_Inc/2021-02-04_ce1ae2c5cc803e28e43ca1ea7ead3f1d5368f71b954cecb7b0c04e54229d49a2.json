  "text": "<p>\n  Spotify's pandemic boost may be peaking. </p><p>\n  The Swedish audiostreaming company posted stronger-than-expected subscription growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 as more listeners tuned into music and podcasts from home amid the pandemic. Still, the company offered a conservative outlook for the current year as new sign-ups could ebb along with the Covid-19 crisis and stay-home directives. Shares in Spotify Technology SA fell 8% to $317.25 Wednesday. </p><p>\n  The pandemic has been a boon for streaming content as lockdowns across the world had consumers turning to screens and smart speakers for entertainment. </p><p>\n  \"In a way it's been one of the most interesting social experiments I've ever seen in real time with a billion-plus people overnight changing pretty much everything about their habits,\" Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek said in an interview. \"Assuming Covid is beyond us in the latter part of 2021, what's going to happen to consumption then? Are people going to travel? What habits are changing? That's a massive amount of uncertainty to have consumers' attention now competing with all other forms of things they could be doing with their time.\" </p><p>\n  The disruption in personal habits, Mr. Ek said on a call with investors, \"caused us to pull forward subscribers across the back half of 2020, which makes it hard to predict if we'll drive the same subscriber growth in the year ahead.\" </p><p>\n  At the end of the fourth quarter, Spotify had 345 million monthly active users, up 27% from a year earlier and at the high end of the company's guidance. Paying subscribers, its most lucrative type of customer, grew to 155 million, up 24% from the year-earlier period and above expectations. </p><p>\n  Average revenue per user for the subscription business in the quarter fell 8% to 4.26 euros, the equivalent of $5.13, as the company continued to attract new subscribers via discounted plans and charge lower prices in new markets such as India and Russia. In October, Spotify raised the price of its family plan in seven markets, a move the company said didn't affect churn or customer intake. In February, it extended price increases to another 25 markets, including in Europe, Latin America and Canada. </p><p>\n  Revenue from subscriptions rose 15% from the year before, to 1.89 billion euros. Advertising revenue jumped 29% to 281 million euros, growing for a second consecutive quarter after sliding in the first half of the year amid pandemic headwinds. Advertising, historically less than 10% of Spotify's top line, accounted for 13% of revenue. It has become a growth area as the company expands its podcast business. </p><p>\n  The company said it now has 2.2 million podcasts available on its service, and consumption hours nearly doubled from 2019's final quarter. During the period, 25% of its monthly active users listened to a podcast, up from 22% in the previous quarter. In December, \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" which arrived on Spotify in September, became exclusive to the service. It is the No. 1 show in 17 markets, and has helped bring in new users, including first-time podcast listeners, the company said. \"We do believe Joe Rogan has contributed positively to user growth,\" finance chief Paul Vogel said on the investor call. </p><p>\n  In music, sponsored recommendations -- a cornerstone of Spotify's \"two-sided marketplace,\" where it charges artists and labels for marketing on the service -- increased 50% from the prior quarter. Billings rose 82% thanks to campaigns promoting albums by Bad Bunny, Taylor Swift and Trippie Redd. </p><p>\n  Overall revenue for the fourth quarter rose 17% to 2.17 billion euros, in line with guidance. The company posted a loss of 125 million euros, or 66 European cents a share, compared with a loss of 209 million euros, or 1.14 euros a share, the year before. While Spotify has periodically reported a quarterly profit, executives have said it would continue to give priority to growth -- attracting new subscribers and investing in podcasting. </p><p>\n  Free cash flow -- a measure of the cash generated from operations -- was 74 million euros, down from 169 million euros a year earlier in part due to higher podcast-related payments. </p><p>\n  For the current quarter, the company forecast monthly active users would grow to between 354 million and 364 million, and premium subscribers to increase to between 155 million and 158 million. It said it expects to generate revenue of 1.99 billion euros to 2.19 billion euros. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Service Braces for </p><p>\n  New Competition </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Spotify may soon be facing competition from bigger rivals, with Amazon.com Inc. ramping up its commitment to podcasts with its purchase of Wondery, and Apple Inc. exploring a subscription service for podcasting. </p><p>\n  Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek said the interest validates its early move into the business, and said the focus will be on ramping up production through the studios it has acquired. </p><p>\n  He said Spotify will commit to making money on podcasts not just through advertising, but also through subscription and a la carte payment. </p><p>\n  \"We're in the early days of seeing the long-term evolution of how we can monetize audio on the internet,\" he said. \"I don't think it's one size fits all.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Ek said it is difficult to forecast how Spotify will perform when introducing the service to new markets -- most recently South Korea, following debuts in India and Russia. While the company tends to be conservative with those estimates, it leaves the potential to outperform, he said. </p><p>\n  \"When I look at the future slate of originals and exclusives, that is a massive unknown but a massive potential upside too,\" said Mr. Ek. \"What happens when we have hundreds of shows exclusive? Those things compound.\" </p><p></p>",
