  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Kremlin Promotes Domestic Social-Media Platforms",
  "text": "<p>The Ministry of Digital Development of the Russian Federation last month said it was taking emergency measures to draw attention to domestic social-networking apps. Rutube, Russia's answer to YouTube, and Fiesta, an Instagram-like app, have since enjoyed a huge surge in downloads, though so have apps that enable people to access recently banned outlets.</p><p>The country's communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, blocked Facebook and Instagram last month after their owner, Meta Platforms Inc., placed restrictions on Russian media outlets.</p><p>Meta and other social-media companies also paused advertising in Russia, making it harder for content creators to generate revenue from a Russian social-media account.</p><p>Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told the State Duma: \"This will return our youth, and give us our own field.\"</p><p>The Kremlin's campaign to encourage Russian upstarts over Western platform operators has put users and content creators in their crosshairs. While people world-wide are turning to YouTube, Instagram and other social-media outlets for news and firsthand accounts of the violence, Russia has made it riskier to provide the online content that is in demand. The government passed a law that threatens prison for anyone publishing what authorities deem to be false information about the invasion. The law applies to both traditional and social media.</p><p>Gazprom-Media, a unit of the Russian energy giant Gazprom PJSC and the owner of Rutube, has been leading Russia's effort to develop social-media alternatives, with the government's backing. Gazprom in November launched Yappy, a homemade version of TikTok. Earlier this month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that money would be invested in Rutube to make it more user-friendly.</p><p>These efforts have had some success. Fiesta, which launched in November, reached No. 1 in downloads among top free iPhone apps in Russia on Apple Inc.'s App Store for five days last month, according to app-analytics firm Sensor Tower Inc. Rutube gained 1.1 million downloads across both Apple's App Store and Alphabet's Google Play in Russia last month, while Yappy has gained two million downloads through them since the start of February, Sensor Tower's data show.</p><p>Still, Russian users are sticking with foreign platforms. Last month, nearly two billion visits to YouTube came from Russian web-browser users across mobile web and desktop, according to estimates provided by analytics firm Similarweb Ltd.</p><p>And apps and browser extensions that enable people to access recently banned social networks have been thriving. Demand for virtual private networks, or VPNs, shot up nearly 2,700% compared with the average daily demand in the week leading up to the start of the invasion, said Top10VPN.com, from London-based research company PrivacyCo Ltd. It estimates that the Kremlin has blocked more than 900 websites relating to the war. According to Similarweb, Instagram had 157 million visits from Russian web users based on the same metrics as YouTube.</p><p>Some Russians simply aren't impressed by the alternatives. Veniamin Prozorov, a 30-year-old graphic designer in Moscow, said he has no interest in leaving YouTube, which he uses for alternative opinions to Russian state media and for entertainment. He also uses Twitter, through a VPN, and Telegram, an encrypted platform.</p><p>\"I unequivocally will not go to Rutube because it's a cheap surrogate that won't ever be able to replace YouTube,\" he said. \"I tried to use it but I had an extremely negative impression from the quality of the video and content that was posted.\"</p><p>The platform, which is organized more like Netflix than YouTube, has sections for news, shows, recommended videos, new video bloggers and TikTok-like shorts. The news is solely from state-backed media, and on a recent day the content was predominantly pro-war. Other popular videos included titles such as \"Swimming in a warm pool\" and \"How I cured my acne.\"</p><p>For some content creators in Russia, the country's platform alternatives aren't large enough for them to make a living. They also don't expect the devoted fan bases they have spent years cultivating on mainstream apps to suddenly move to Russian networks.</p>",
