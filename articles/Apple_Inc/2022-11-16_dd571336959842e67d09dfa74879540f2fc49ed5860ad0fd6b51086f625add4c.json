  "text": "<p>The signs of slowing growth in China will add to fears that the worst has yet to come for the global economy, especially with many economists expecting a recession in the U.S. over the next 12 months.</p><p>Domestically, the deteriorating economic picture presents a challenge for Xi Jinping, who last month secured a third term as leader of China's ruling Communist Party. Mr. Xi has consolidated control over economic policy-making. Many economists and investors are looking for signs that he will adopt a more pragmatic approach as rules that he has championed to rein in property developer debt and eradicate Covid-19 have crushed sentiment.</p><p>The country is set to miss its official target of about 5.5% gross domestic product growth this year, with the economy expanding by only 3% during the first nine months.</p><p>In a tacit acknowledgment of the economic pain their policies have wrought, Chinese authorities on Friday issued a set of 16 measures that extend funding relief to highly-indebted developers and strengthen housing supplies, among other things.</p><p>On the same day, China's health authority published 20 measures aimed at reducing the economic and societal impacts of its pandemic controls.</p><p>\"The key question on investors' minds is whether there will be follow-up policies in the same direction going forward,\" noted Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Hong Kong-based Pinpoint Asset Management.</p><p>Last month, consumer sentiment remained weak and labor market conditions barely improved as China battled its broadest-based Covid-19 outbreaks since the Omicron variant of the coronavirus first began to spread widely in the fall of last year.</p><p>Daily new Covid infection counts have surged to more than 11,000 on average over the past week, more than tripling from a week earlier.</p><p>Two large provinces -- Guangdong, a major export hub in southern China, and Henan, home to Apple Inc.'s main iPhone assembler -- have stepped up restrictions over the past month. In Beijing, schools have been shut as many residents have been confined to their homes again as cases surge.</p><p>The new restrictions took a toll on retail sales, a key gauge of domestic consumption, which fell 0.5% in October from a year earlier, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics -- the first such year-over-year decline since May, when Shanghai was stuck in a grueling monthslong lockdown.</p><p>Sales of consumer electronics, home decorations and furniture all fell from a year earlier, while demand for smartphone upgrades also slowed. Spending on restaurant dining dropped by nearly 9% from a year earlier, though sales of medicine and fresh food ticked higher.</p><p>\"Covid measures in October affected consumer behavior even though it was a month containing long holidays,\" said Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING, referring to the weeklong National Day holiday that began on Oct. 1.</p><p>Factory output and investment, which have both benefited from Beijing's economic relief plans, decelerated in October.</p><p>Industrial production rose 5% from a year earlier in October, slowing from September's 6.3% growth, amid falling export demand and weakening domestic sales. Growth in the auto sector slowed particularly sharply, rising just 8.6% in October from a year earlier, down from an increase of 25.4% in September.</p><p>While China's headline unemployment rate held steady at 5.5%, rates of joblessness in 31 major cities edged up to 6% in October from 5.8% for the previous month.</p>",
