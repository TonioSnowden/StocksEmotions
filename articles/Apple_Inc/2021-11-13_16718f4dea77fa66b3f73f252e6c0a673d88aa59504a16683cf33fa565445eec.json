  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Eating & Drinking -- Slow Food Fast:  Seared Mackerel With Soused Vegetables  ----  By Kitty Greenwald",
  "text": "<p>\n  [SATISFYING AND SEASONAL FOOD IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Chef: Tomos Parry </p><p>\n  His Restaurants: Brat and Brat at Climpson's Arch, both in East London </p><p>\n  What He's Known For: Simple cooking over live fire. Meticulous sourcing. An unpretentious welcome and an ambitious vision. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  It's amazing what a splash of vinegar will do for an oily fish. \"This is a British version of fish en escabeche, sweet and sour,\" said chef Tomos Parry of his third Slow Food Fast recipe, for grilled mackerel with \"soused\" vegetables. </p><p>\n  First, Mr. Parry simmers root vegetables in a light pickling liquid made with fish stock, vinegar, olive oil, coriander, orange peel and a little honey. As the veggies soften, he gives the mackerel a quick sear to crisp its skin. Finally, the fish goes into the pan with the vegetables just to cook through. </p><p>\n  He likes to serve this rustic dish straight from the pan, with some grilled bread and perhaps a salad. It's the sort of straight-ahead, full-flavored cooking that recently won Mr. Parry's East London restaurant Brat a spot on the World's Best 50 Restaurants list. A version of mackerel with soused vegetables has been on the menu since Brat opened in March 2018. \"And it will always be,\" Mr. Parry said. \"It's part of who we are.\" </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Total Time: 25 minutes </p><p>\n  Serves: 4 </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  4 (4-ounce) skin-on mackerel fillets </p><p>\n  Kosher salt </p><p>\n  4 tablespoons olive oil </p><p>\n  2 fennel heads, bulbs thinly sliced and fronds reserved for garnish </p><p>\n  1 carrot, thinly sliced </p><p>\n  1 shallot, thinly sliced </p><p>\n  1/2 stick celery, thinly sliced </p><p>\n  2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced </p><p>\n  1 bay leaf </p><p>\n  1/4 cup fish stock, plus more as needed </p><p>\n  1 teaspoon honey </p><p>\n  1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds </p><p>\n  1/2 teaspoon chile flakes </p><p>\n  3 tablespoons Chardonnay vinegar or apple cider vinegar, plus more as needed </p><p>\n  1/4 orange, zest finely grated </p><p>\n  1/3 cup thinly sliced Treviso </p><p>\n  Parsley, minced, to garnish </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  1. Season fish on all sides with salt and set aside. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2. Prepare the soused vegetables: Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large pan over medium heat. Stir in sliced fennel, carrots, shallots, celery, garlic and bay leaf. Gently sweat vegetables until they soften but pick up no color, about 6 minutes. Add fish stock and simmer to reduce slightly, about 3 minutes. Add honey, coriander seeds, chile flakes, vinegar and orange zest. Continue simmering until vegetables soften and take on a lightly pickled flavor, about 10 minutes more. Season with salt and add more vinegar or stock, as needed, to give the sauce a gently acidic flavor. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  3. Meanwhile, set a separate large frying pan over medium-high heat and swirl in 1 tablespoon oil. Lay in fish, skin-side down, and sear without flipping until skin crisps and turns golden, about 3 minutes. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  4. Stir Treviso into pan with vegetables. Once Treviso wilts, transfer fish, skin-side up, to the same pan. Gently cook fish through alongside vegetables, about 5 minutes more. Transfer fish and vegetables with pan drippings to a platter. Garnish with parsley and fennel fronds. Serve with grilled bread. </p><p></p>",
