  "text": "<p>Feeling competitive after hearing Ben and Ted boast, I decided to arrive at the airport only an hour early for my trip home to Ohio. Dumb. The Denver airport is no Cleveland: At 52 square miles, it's the largest airport in the U.S. Why didn't Ted remind me of that? My most ignominious moment was at TSA PreCheck. I couldn't pull up my electronic boarding pass on my Apple Wallet app. It isn't that easy; I have a lot of old boarding passes in there. A young woman in line helped me.</p><p>Then two crew members cut in front of me in the security line. That was legit. But one flight attendant had a ton of stuff in his carry-on bag and got searched. You'd think an airline worker would know how to pack. I had an iPad in my carry-on, which is usually permissible in PreCheck, but not in this particular Denver line. I got to hold a placard that said I didn't have to take my shoes off. That was my only perk.</p><p>I hopped a shuttle train. I ran on a moving sidewalk. I jogged past a tapas bar and cookie shop. I arrived at the gate just as the attendant announced the doors were closing. I said, \"I'm too old for this kind of sprinting.\" He smiled and held the door open. Lesson learned. I'm back to 1Â½ hours.</p><p>Mr. Stratton is author of the blog Klezmer Guy: Real Music &amp; Real Estate.</p><p>Rushing to the Gate Is a Young Man's Game</p>",
