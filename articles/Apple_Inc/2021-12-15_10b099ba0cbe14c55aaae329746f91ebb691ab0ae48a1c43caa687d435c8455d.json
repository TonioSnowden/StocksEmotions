  "title": "How 'Succession' Stoked a Frenzy for Status Baseball Caps; To subtly telegraph their affluence, wealthy characters like Kendall Roy sport pricey cashmere caps. And somewhat improbably, these hats are selling out in real life, too.",
  "text": "<p>In a recent episode of \"Succession,\" whose third season wrapped on Dec. 12, the combative father-and-son pair, Logan and Kendall Roy (played by Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong), wore two such nearly identical, dark, non-logoed hats to a hostile meeting. On the hit series, the solid caps \"often represent authority and intimidation,\" explained the show's costume designer, Michelle Matland. As she sees it, the absence of a logo says there's \"no relevant team but…team Me,\" making the hats fitting accessories for the show's ego-centric characters.</p><p>Such caps might look ordinary, but they're inordinately pricey. The hat Kendall Roy wears is a $625 Loro Piana cashmere number with an adjustable leather strap. In season two of Apple's \"The Morning Show,\" disgraced TV anchor Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) sports a $595 cashmere Zegna hat as he tries to keep a low profile while exiled in Italy.</p><p>Rich-guy ballcaps radiate a stealth wealth that reflects a larger truth about how the affluent dress today. The look expresses \"the idea that really wealthy people don't need to display their wealth\" to the general public, said Kyle Stevens, 42, a film and TV professor at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., who took note of Mitch Kessler's opulent cap while binging \"The Morning Show.\" Tellingly, costume designers often pair the hats with solid-navy sport coats or down vests. That you can't easily tell who makes these surely spendy clothes is part of the point.</p><p>Further proof that the one percent seems to prefer costly clothes that look entirely banal in passing: Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has spoken at conferences while wearing subdued white $690 Gucci sneakers and, infamously, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's muted gray T-shirts from Italian luxury label Brunello Cucinelli cost $300-ish. A prevailing mentality is that if you wear logos from head to toe, \"you are gaudy, you're new money,\" said Tiffanie Woods, 29, a social media manager in Buffalo, N.Y., who also runs the Instagram account @successionfits, which identifies clothes worn on the HBO show.</p><p>Call it \"investment normcore\"—clothes that blend in with a man-of-the-people look but take a bite out of one's bank account. A solid cashmere cap that the uninformed could mistake for a $17 Gap hat exemplifies this trend for gratuitous luxury. It is the $295 hamburger of the clothing world—a polarizing extravagance that you must be this rich to partake in.</p><p>Much the way Instagramming that hamburger with a coded caption clues in only insiders, part of these hats' appeal is that they alert other one-percenters that you're with the investment-banker crowd. Their wooly texture is slight but significant, and details like adjustable leather straps flag the caps as accessories solely for the private-jet set. Said Ms. Woods, they \"give off that status, that moniker of wealth\" recognized only by others in the top tax bracket. That is, until shows like \"Succession\" made anyone with a $10 HBO Max subscription aware of these $625 caps.</p><p>Off screen, such hats are selling. They \"seem to be having this moment,\" said Shannon Stewart, the chief product officer at Harry Rosen, a Canadian high-end menswear chain, where ball caps including those in cashmere are outperforming other hat styles like beanies and driving caps. Harry Rosen sells them primarily in plain colors like navy, gray and black, from brands like Brunello Cucinelli, Wigens and Zegna—and they're so popular the shops are \"practically sold out,\" noted Ms. Stewart.</p><p>Like any capable retailer, Ms. Stewart made the hard sell that cashmere hats are worth the investment due to their \"fine\" materials. \"[These caps] feel a bit dressier, a bit more sophisticated,\" she said. \"You're not going to wear a logoed cap with your sport jacket or your suit.\" They're also warmer than a typical cotton cap—though that hardly explains why they're 10-plus times as expensive. But that elevated price might be the biggest selling point. It weeds out most anyone who doesn't drive a Maybach, making these caps their own private club.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
