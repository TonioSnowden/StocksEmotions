  "title": "China Is Creating  Digital Currency, First  For a Major Economy  ---  Cyber yuan will let Beijing track spending  in real time, pose challenge to dollar  ----  By James T. Areddy",
  "text": "<p>   A thousand years ago, when money meant coins, China invented paper currency. Now the Chinese government is minting cash digitally, in a re-imagination of money that could shake a pillar of American power. </p><p>   It might seem money is already virtual, as credit cards and payment apps such as Apple Pay in the U.S. and WeChat in China eliminate the need for bills or coins. But those are just ways to move money electronically. China is turning legal tender itself into computer code. </p><p>   Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have foreshadowed a potential digital future for money, though they exist outside the traditional global financial system and aren't legal tender like cash issued by governments. </p><p>   China's version of a digital currency is controlled by its central bank, which will issue the new electronic money. It is expected to give China's government vast new tools to monitor both its economy and its people. By design, the digital yuan will negate one of bitcoin's major draws: anonymity for the user. </p><p>   Beijing is also positioning the digital yuan for international use and designing it to be untethered to the global financial system, where the U.S. dollar is king. China is embracing digitization in many forms, including money, in a bid to gain more centralized control while getting a head start on technologies of the future. </p><p>   \"In order to protect our currency sovereignty and legal currency status, we have to plan ahead,\" said Mu Changchun, who leads the project at the People's Bank of China. </p><p>   That an authoritarian state and U.S. rival has taken the lead to introduce a national digital currency is propelling a wonky topic for cryptocurrency theorists into a point of anxiety in Washington. </p><p>   Asked in recent weeks how digitized national currencies  might affect the dollar, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have said this is being studied in earnest, including whether a digital dollar makes sense someday. </p><p>   The dollar far outstrips all other currencies for use in international foreign-exchange trades, at 88% in the latest rankings from the Bank for International Settlements. The yuan was used in just 4%. </p><p>   Digitization wouldn't by itself make the yuan a rival in bank-to-bank wire transfers, analysts and economists say. But it could gain traction on the margins. It would provide options for people in poor countries to transfer money. Even limited international usage could soften the bite of U.S. sanctions, which increasingly are used against Chinese companies or individuals. </p><p>   The digital yuan resides in cyberspace, available on the owner's mobile phone -- or on a card for the less tech-savvy -- and spending it doesn't strictly require an online connection. It appears on a screen with a representation of Mao. </p><p>   In tests, more than 100,000 people have downloaded a mobile-phone app enabling them to spend small government handouts of digital cash. </p><p>   \"It's pretty good,\" said Tao Wei, a young woman in Beijing, after spending a test allotment to pay for her daughter's birthday portrait. </p><p>   China has indicated the digital yuan will circulate alongside bills and coins for some time. Bankers say Beijing aims to digitize all of its cash eventually. Beijing hasn't said. </p><p>   Digitized money lets the issuing government track spending in real time, speed relief to disaster victims or flag criminal activity. Beijing stands to gain vast new powers to tighten President Xi Jinping's authoritarian rule. </p><p>   Elements of this kind of control already exist in China, with digital payments the norm. Mr. Mu has said the central bank will limit how it tracks individuals. </p><p>   The money is programmable. Beijing has tested expiration dates to prompt users to spend it quickly at times. </p><p>   It's also trackable, adding a tool to China's surveillance. The government deploys hundreds of millions of facial-recognition cameras, sometimes using them to levy fines for activities such as jaywalking. A digital currency would make it possible to both mete out and collect fines as soon as an infraction was detected. </p><p>   Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are famous for volatility. But the People's Bank of China will ensure there aren't valuation differences between the digital yuan and the paper bills and coins. Anti-counterfeiting measures will aim to make it impossible for anyone besides the PBOC to create new digital yuan. </p><p>   The central bank says it may initially impose limits on how much digital yuan individuals can keep on their person, as a way to control how it circulates and provide users a dose of security and privacy. </p><p>   It won't use the new technology as a way to get more money into circulation, since every yuan issued digitally will essentially cancel one yuan circulating in physical form. </p><p>   When bitcoin launched in 2009, most nations' policy makers largely played down its significance. China paid attention. </p><p>   Always vigilant to threats, the leadership feared a cryptocurrency could undermine government power if people began using it in earnest. Zhou Xiaochuan, China's top central banker from 2002 to 2018, has said bitcoin both dazzled and frightened him. In 2014, he launched a formal study for a possible Chinese digital currency. </p><p>   China hardly looked like a currency pioneer. Its strict government control of the yuan, for instance, ran counter to the rip-roaring trade in other major currencies. </p><p>   At the same time, a financial-technology revolution was under way in China, with the frenetic adoption of the AliPay and WeChat apps making cash mostly unneeded, and turbocharging startup companies with ways to pay on the go. </p><p>   Then, in mid-2019, Facebook Inc. said it would pursue its own cryptocurrency. The realization this could circulate in a user base far bigger than any national population brought immediate recognition that technology could upend traditional currencies. </p><p>   While U.S. regulators focused on stopping Facebook, ultimately succeeding, China accelerated its pursuit of a digitized yuan, launching trials in April 2020. </p><p>   Central bankers from the U.S. and other Western economies fret that what Facebook planned with a digital currency could now be done by China, a powerful government. </p><p>   \"There is a sort of Uber fear,\" said a senior European central banker who has spoken to Western counterparts, referring to stress on taxi systems when the ride-hailing company arrived in cities around the world. \"You don't want another country's currency circulating among your citizens,\" the banker said. </p><p>   The U.S., as the issuer of dollars that the world's more than 21,000 banks need to do business, has long demanded insight into major cross-border currency movements. This gives Washington the ability to freeze individuals and institutions out of the global financial system by barring banks from doing transactions with them, a practice criticized as \"dollar weaponization.\" </p><p>   American sanctions on North Korea and Iran for nuclear programs hobble their economies. Swiss banks abandoned their famous secrecy eight years ago to avoid Washington's wrath in a showdown over taxes. After the February coup in Myanmar, the U.S. used sanctions to block the movement of top military officials' financial assets through banks. The Treasury's database of sanctioned individuals and firms -- the \"Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List\" -- touches virtually every nation on earth. </p><p>   Beijing is especially discomfited by a fast-expanding part of the sanctions register: more than 250 Chinese names, including politicians the U.S. accuses of atrocities against ethnic minorities or of curtailing freedoms in Hong Kong. Sanctions left Carrie Lam, China's top official in Hong Kong, with a stockpile of cash in her home because banks feared that accepting her business would risk exposing them, too, to an American freeze. </p><p>   The digital yuan could give those the U.S. seeks to penalize a way to exchange money without U.S. knowledge. Exchanges wouldn't need to use SWIFT, the messaging network that is used in money transfers between commercial banks and that can be monitored by the U.S. government. </p><p>   The chance to weaken the power of American sanctions is central to Beijing's marketing of the digital yuan and to its efforts to internationalize the yuan more generally. Speaking at a forum last month, China's Mr. Mu, the central bank official, repeatedly said the digital yuan is aimed at protecting China's \"monetary sovereignty,\" including by offsetting global use of the dollar. </p><p>   In a 2019 war game at Harvard University, veteran U.S. policy makers scrambled to craft a response to a nuclear-missile development by North Korea secretly funded with digital yuan. Because of the currency's power to undercut sanctions, the participants, including several who are now in the Biden administration, deemed it more threatening than the warhead. </p><p>    Nicholas Burns, a longtime American diplomat and favorite to be ambassador in Beijing, told the group, \"The Chinese have created a problem for us by taking away our sanctions leverage.\" </p><p>   As China's marketing for the digital yuan kicks into high gear, an English-language animation circulated online by state broadcaster CGTN shows a man in an American-flag shirt knocked out by a golden coin depicting digital yuan. </p><p>   \"This is one of the building blocks of China's move toward world market status and greater involvement in setting the framework of the global economy,\" the narrator says. </p><p>   Initially, the digital yuan won't change significantly how money circulates through China's financial system. Under the central bank's direction, the six biggest commercial banks -- all government-owned -- will distribute digital yuan to smaller banks and to app providers AliPay and WeChat, which are expected to manage sender-recipient interactions. </p><p></p>",
