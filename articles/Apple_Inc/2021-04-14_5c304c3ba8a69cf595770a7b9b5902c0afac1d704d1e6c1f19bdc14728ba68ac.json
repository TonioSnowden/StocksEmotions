  "text": "<p>Hundreds of the biggest US companies, top executives and leading law firms have pledged to fight efforts to restrict voting rights in states across the country, in an escalation of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8eaa2bb-d221-422b-bfb7-d5bc365178f5\">corporate America's battle </a>with the Republican party over the issue.&#xa0;</p> <p>Companies including Amazon, Apple, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs signed a statement organised by senior black executives, resolving to stand against “any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot”.</p> <p>They were joined by a host of individual executives, from Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett to Citigroup chief Jane Fraser, more than 60 law firms, and celebrities including Samuel L Jackson, Katy Perry and Shonda Rhimes. Some large companies did not sign the statement, however, including JPMorgan Chase, Nike and Walmart.&#xa0;</p> <p>Although pitched as a non-partisan stand for fundamental democratic rights, the decision by so many business leaders to speak out comes as Republicans in 47 states have proposed more than 300 bills which the independent Brennan Center says would restrict access to the polls, particularly for black voters.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>It also follows withering attacks from top Republicans on the executives who have criticised new voting laws in the weeks since activists began applying pressure on companies based <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7b3e5c9-fe0c-4a60-9e00-ee7a6cdb5ad0\">in Georgia</a>, one of the first states to pass such legislation.&#xa0;</p> <p>Donald Trump, the former president, urged his supporters 10 days ago to boycott “woke companies” including Coca-Cola and JPMorgan for their stances. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, told companies to “stay out of politics”. And Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, dubbed critics of the Georgia laws including Delta Air Lines “woke corporate hypocrites”.</p> <p>The new statement was placed as an advertisement in US newspapers by the Black Economic Alliance, a group of top African-American executives including Ken Frazier of Merck &amp; Co, Ken Chenault, the former American Express chief, and Ursula Burns, the former head of Xerox.&#xa0;</p> <p>The breadth of support shown in Wednesday's statement marks a striking change of urgency from US businesses on a subject they increasingly see as central to their pledges to advance racial equity. </p> <p>Just two weeks ago the Black Economic Alliance issued another <a href=\"https://blackeconomicalliance.org/\">open letter</a>, urging their peers not to stay on the sidelines at a moment when most companies were saying little on the subject.&#xa0;</p> <p>Charles Phillips, co-chair of the Alliance, said companies had come off the sidelines “in a massive way”, partly because of their employees' “heightened sensitivity” around racial equity during the trial of the police officer who killed George Floyd last year and protests over the police shooting of Daunte Wright in a Minneapolis suburb on Sunday.&#xa0;</p> <p>Had the statement called for more specific actions from business or legislators, “it would [have made] it difficult for people to sign on,” he said, but the unity between black and white executives on the issue had sent a message that would be hard for legislators to ignore. “They care about jobs. They care about what these companies think,” he said.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The show and scale of support and unity is more important than the specificity of the substance and the absence of certain companies,” said Bennett Freeman, a former state department official who advises companies on human rights issues and participated in executives' discussions on how to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b1a2d20-4462-476f-98de-dd95edac0530\">co-ordinate their stance </a>on voting rights in recent days.</p> <p>The new statement does not commit the signatories to any specific action, such as lobbying, freezing political donations or pulling investment. It also makes no mention of individual states such as Arizona, Texas and Michigan where companies are already being dragged into fights over new voting bills. </p> <p>General Motors' Mary Barra and Ford's Jim Farley were among the Michigan-based chief executives who signed a separate statement urging the government to “avoid actions that reduce participation in elections — particularly among historically disenfranchised communities”.</p> <p>Executives have been wary of engaging on issues that divide Republicans and Democrats, but many have realised that staying silent costs them more reputationally with consumers and employees.&#xa0;</p> <p>Dan Schulman, chief executive of PayPal, told the Financial Times last week he had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ffd9017-3689-440a-bc3d-4277b8a5a73a?\">received “multiple death threats”</a> because of its stance on divisive social issues. But, he added, “there is no way for a company like PayPal, with the scale we have, to stay out of the cultural wars”.&#xa0;</p> <p>A few executives continue to disagree, however. Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong, who did not sign Wednesday's statement, told CNBC: “Companies today with great intentions can sometimes end up creating division and . . . unwelcoming environments internally by engaging some of these issues.”</p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson 2021 'Corporate America pledges to fight efforts to restrict voting' FT.com 14 April.
