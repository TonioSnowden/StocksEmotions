  "text": "<p>Nearly three-quarters of China's total electricity generation comes from fossil fuels. Cutting down on coal is a key pillar of Beijing's climate change promises. It now faces a dilemma over its priorities.</p> <p>China has ordered coal miners to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4290d41-d45d-49c1-b779-59f01f29d4e8\">boost production</a> urgently as an energy shortage threatens factories and pushes consumer prices higher. </p> <p>There is good reason. Power shortages in China threaten a popular backlash against the government. More than 20 provinces, mostly where manufacturing is centred, have implemented power cuts. That affects production of everything from iPhones to Toyota cars and toys. And it results in factory closures. Producer inflation is soaring, up nearly a tenth in August.</p> <p>Meanwhile, scarce electricity disrupts the food supply chain as food processing plants are shut down. China has already warned food security is a concern as global food prices hit decade highs, according to UN data.</p> <p>Some of the biggest beneficiaries of the power crisis have been coal miners. Share values of local majors such as China Coal Energy and Shanxi Coking Coal Energy have nearly doubled this year as record coal prices fattened margins. Those should now fall.</p> <p>On the flip side, power companies that depend heavily on coal such as Datang, Huadian Power and Huaneng Power are expected to post steep losses for the third quarter. Stabilising fuel prices and household electricity supply before the cold winter months should be a priority for the government. </p> <p>The latest measures are, however, unlikely to be enough to alleviate the crisis for industries that use the most energy, such steel and chemicals. A much bigger supply response is needed. But it will provide short-term relief for industries such as food and tech manufacturing.</p> <p>Beijing has already been forced to backtrack on its own trade bans on Australian coal. The power crisis may persuade it that achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 is too great a stretch. It can at least stop public discontent over soaring costs in the meantime.</p><p>Source:  2021 'China power crunch/coal: a changing list of priorities ' FT.com 8 October.
