  "title": "REVIEW --- How to Fix Social Media: No More Blind Trust In Big Tech",
  "text": "<p>That's because even though Facebook presents itself as a free service, it uses its platform to gather personal data and sell targeted ads, turning its own users into profit centers -- and our lack of data privacy laws helps its bottom line. In fact, the company brings in twice as much money from its American users as it does from users in other countries with more stringent protections.</p><p>It's not just Facebook's use of personal data that makes it dangerous, it's the lengths to which the company will go to keep users online. Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower, showed us how its algorithms are designed to promote content that incites the most reaction. Facebook knows that the more time users spend on its platforms, the more data it can collect and monetize. Time and time again, it has put profits over people.</p><p>For too long, social media companies essentially have been saying \"trust us, we've got this,\" but that time of blind trust is coming to an end.</p><p>While my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are committed to reform, these are complicated problems. We have to come at this from multiple angles -- starting with data privacy. We need to make sure that Americans can control how their data gets collected and used. When Apple gave its users the option to have their data tracked or not, more than 75 percent declined to opt in. That says something. We need a national privacy law now.</p><p>We also know that one-third of kids age 7 to 9 use social media apps, so we need stronger laws to protect them online. Right now, American kids are being overwhelmed by harmful content -- and we don't have nearly enough information about what social media companies are doing with their data. We can't let companies put their profits above the well-being of children.</p><p>One reason Facebook can get away with this behavior is because it knows consumers don't have alternatives. In CEO Mark Zuckerberg's own words in a 2008 email, \"It's better to buy than compete.\" Who knows what user-friendly privacy protections competitors like Instagram could have developed if Facebook hadn't purchased them? To protect competition in the digital marketplace, we have to update our antitrust and competition laws and make sure the enforcement agencies have the resources to do their jobs.</p><p>Finally, we need transparency -- and action -- on the algorithms that govern so much of our lives. Between Facebook's role in promoting health misinformation during the pandemic and Instagram's directing kids to accounts that glorify eating disorders, it's clear that online algorithms can lead to real-world harm. Congress has to look at how harmful content is amplified.</p><p>We know from experience that these companies will keep milking users for profits until Congress steps in. Now is the time to act, and we have bipartisan momentum to stop just admiring the problem and finally do something about it.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Klobuchar, a Democrat, is a U.S. Senator from Minnesota.</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Privacy Protections Need a Legislative Update\" -- WSJ Nov. 12, 2021)</p>",
