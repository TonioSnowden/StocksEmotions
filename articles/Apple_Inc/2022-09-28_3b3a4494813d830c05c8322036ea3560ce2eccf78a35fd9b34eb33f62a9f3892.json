  "title": "Lions Gate Explores Spinning Off Studio Instead of Starz Channel; Production company says it still plans to separate the two entities despite market turbulence",
  "text": "<p>Rather than unloading the Starz business, which it acquired for $4.4 billion in 2016, Lions Gate said the negotiations process has pushed the company toward the possibility of spinning off its studio side instead.</p><p>\"We are continuing productive negotiations with prospective strategic and financial partners on both sides of our business,\" the company said, according to the securities filing.</p><p>Lions Gate said in November that recent transactions in the media space had encouraged it to explore a potential sale or spinoff. That same month, the owner of the hit children's show \"CoComelon\" agreed to be acquired in a deal that would value the company at $2.75 billion.</p><p>At the time, Lions Gate indicated that the Starz business, which is known for original series including \"Power\" and \"Outlander,\" would be its spinoff target.</p><p>Lions Gate, the studio behind the John Wick and Hunger Games movie franchises, first expressed interest in splitting the channel off into its own company in 2019, in a bid to reduce the studio's debt load. The company had discussed selling Starz to CBS, now ViacomCBS Inc., earlier that year, though the talks never led to a deal.</p><p>Separately, Lions Gate said Wednesday that its international streaming service Starzplay has been rebranded to Lionsgate+ in 35 countries. It is the latest streaming service to distribute content on a channel bearing its name and a plus sign, joining the likes of Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ and ESPN+, Apple Inc.'s Apple TV+ and AMC Networks Entertainment LLC's AMC+.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Lions Gate Explores Spinning Off Studio Instead of Starz Channel</p>",
