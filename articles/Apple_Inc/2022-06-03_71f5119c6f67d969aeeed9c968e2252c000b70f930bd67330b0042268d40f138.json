  "text": "<p>Wall Street was largely unrattled by her departure. Some analysts didn't view it as an indication of looming challenges for Meta and remain bullish on the company's prospects. One key reason: Ms. Sandberg's success in monetizing the tech giant's platform, helping it to rake in nearly $120 billion in revenue last year.</p><p>R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said Ms. Sandberg's departure won't weaken Facebook's ability to generate revenue and fund founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's ambitions to push into areas such as the so-called metaverse, the online virtual realm where proponents expect people to work, shop and interact. \"Her legacy, in our view, is that Meta has one of the strongest business models in the digital economy,\" the analyst said in a research note. He added that under Ms. Sandberg's watch, Meta had \"a history of overcoming obstacles to cement a leadership position in social media and online advertising.\"</p><p>Meta shares, after closing down 2.6% Wednesday following the late afternoon announcement, rose 5.4% on Thursday, to $198.86 each. They are down more than 40% this year, amid a selloff in tech stocks and challenges in online advertising.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg's departure comes after a stretch of controversy for Meta, from being blamed for Russian interference in the 2016 election to misinformation and harmful posts. Lately, Apple Inc.'s new ad-privacy policy, which required apps to ask users whether they want to be tracked and limited the ability to gather data, is threatening the advertising business of Meta and others.</p><p>\"While Sheryl is leaving in the midst of perhaps the biggest change and challenge for the digital advertising industry since the introduction of mobile devices, we think that Meta is already on the path towards reviving some of its legacy platform advantages -- this could be her final stamp on the business,\" Mr. Sebastian said.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg has been in her role since 2008, serving as Mr. Zuckerberg's top lieutenant and becoming one of the most prominent women in business. She was charged with advertising sales and legal and policy issues, freeing Mr. Zuckerberg to focus on engineering challenges.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg, who came to the company from a sales and operations role at Google, advanced the company's digital advertising through several transitions, including mobile, video and, most recently, the \"stories\" feature of short videos on its platforms.</p><p>Now, the company is pivoting toward the metaverse, which will rely less on digital advertising.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
