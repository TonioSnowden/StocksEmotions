  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Oil prices are still strong, with WTI, the US benchmark, trading above $72 a barrel on Tuesday morning. </p> <p>So let me start with a query for any of our readers in the American shale patch. All drillers make money at those prices, right? Or even at $65 a barrel, the price quoted on the Intercontinental Exchange for WTI in June 2022. So why is the drilling recovery still so tepid? It can't just be about the new era of capital discipline, because a producer could easily honour those pledges to pay back shareholders <em>and</em> start increasing production. Is it fear that Opec will crush prices again at the first sign of a recovery in shale output?

Globally, the world added more than 260GW of renewables in 2020, compared with 60GW of fossil energy.</p> <p>Irena's country-level analysis showed that the renewables added in 2020 would save non-OECD countries around $156bn over the course of the facilities' lifetimes, relative to the cost of adding the same amount of fossil fuel-fired generation. China, Brazil and India were expected to save the most.</p> <p>As renewables become cheaper, coal in particular is becoming less economic, the group said.</p> <p>“Given that coal-fired power plants have significant fixed operations and maintenance costs, reduced generation starts to significantly raise operating costs, further worsening the competitiveness of these coal plants,” said Irena.</p> <p>In May, the G7 group of nations pledged to stop all new financing for overseas coal projects by the end of this year.</p> <p>Mafalda Duarte, chief executive of&#xa0;the&#xa0;Climate Investment Funds,&#xa0;welcomed the pledge, but told me it was “not enough to focus on renewable energy investments and energy efficiency”. Developing nations needed help to transition away from the dirtiest power too.</p> <p>She added that phasing out coal was not “a pure economic issue” — and the lower cost renewables did not mean “the market will take care of everything”.</p> <p>Instead, there are complex, country specific hurdles including regulations, incentivising private sector investment, and figuring out how to support the communities that depend on fossil fuels for their income, she said. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“We lack experience and examples of how to do this in developing countries.”&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p><em>(Camilla Hodgson)</em></p> <h1>. . . but solar costs may have bottomed out</h1> <p>The decade-long cost reductions in solar power may be coming to an end.&#xa0;</p> <p>The cost of solar energy fell by 80 per cent between 2010 and 2020, causing the International Energy Agency to announce last year that solar was the cheapest source of energy in history.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet those cost reductions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f8dd951-a1b1-410a-89dd-14728c56235d\">may now have run their course</a> due to higher raw material prices, as the global economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>US steel prices have almost tripled since the early days of the pandemic, while prices for polysilicon, the raw material for solar cells, have risen by over 160 per cent this year alone to $28.5 a kilogramme.</p> <p>Solar companies are also growing concerned about using polysilicon from China, since 40 per cent of it comes from the far western region of Xinjiang, where factories have been linked to forced labour.&#xa0;</p> <p>If Europe and the US decide to cut out polysilicon from China, that would be a “major issue” for the solar supply chain, Max Slee, a portfolio manager at Ecofin in London said, substantially raising the costs.&#xa0;</p> <p>As a result of the cost pressures, prices for monocrystalline silicon cells — modules that allow for the conversion of light into power —&#xa0;have risen by a quarter from this time last year, BloombergNEF data show.&#xa0;</p> <p>This is a process that looks set to continue. As the transition takes hold, factors including higher power prices, a carbon price and capex reflation could cause monocrystalline prices to double, according to Thunder Said Energy, a consultancy. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“Continued innovation may offset our challenges,” said Rob West, founder of Thunder Said. “But we fear the energy transition is shaping up to unleash woeful inflation and some solar developers may get burnt.”</p> </blockquote> <p>“The narrative in the solar industry has shifted,” Bruno Brunetti, an analyst at S&amp;P Global Platts, said. “We have seen steep declines in costs over the past decade, but we are seeing that stabilise now and even increase in some cases.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Investors are growing anxious about the cost increases. Shares in solar companies have fallen by 18 per cent this year, after more than tripling in 2020, according to the MAC Global Solar Energy Index. <em>(Henry Sanderson)</em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>As anyone who's been out and about in the US will have noticed, traffic is now back to its worst. Apple's mobility data (based on map routing requests) suggests driving is well above its pre-pandemic levels. Even walking has picked up. But public transit? As anyone who's been on a New York subway lately will have also have noticed: not so much. </p> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Three of the directors nominated to ExxonMobil's board by activist hedge fund Engine No 1 won election, the company <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2021/0621_ExxonMobil-announces-final-results-in-election-of-directors\">confirmed</a> on Monday.
