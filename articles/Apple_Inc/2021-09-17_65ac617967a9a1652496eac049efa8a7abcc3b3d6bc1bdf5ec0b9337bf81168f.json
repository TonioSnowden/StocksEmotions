  "text": "<p>By the end of the year, however, a reckoning came.</p><p>My scrupulous saving led me to think I could take on a big expense to improve my life: I decided to leave my tiny Harlem apartment in search of more space to work from home. The place I found in Brooklyn was pricier—and I wouldn't have a roommate to pick up half the rent, either—but I thought I could afford it because I was saving so much money elsewhere.</p><p>Then the restrictions lifted. And all of a sudden not only did I have the higher rent to pay, but also all of those discretionary expenses that I had put on hold—like hundreds of dollars spent on brunches with friends who had been similarly cramped, stressed and depressed.</p><p>Somehow I had fallen from my savings windfall, and have since felt that I needed some specialized help. So this past summer, I decided to hire a financial planner.</p><p>Coming to grips with it all</p><p>I was terrified, and I told her so. Not only had I never worked with a financial planner, I had never even had a conversation about budgeting with my parents growing up, and it was clear that the skills I had cobbled together on my own weren't getting the job done in this precarious economic moment. But I was immediately reminded why I deliberately chose to work with an African-American planner. \"This is not stuff that we're taught,\" she told me, assuaging my anxiety and self-consciousness as she commenced combing through a month's worth of my expenditures.</p><p>The first thing she noticed was that, like many of her other clients, Amazon had become my new best friend. What started out as a helpful way to avoid the ever-present plague by buying necessities online became something more compulsive over time.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How have your post-lockdown saving and spending habits changed? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Even as the pandemic restrictions were lifting, I felt a growing need to exert control over my reality through buying. A year at home had taken a toll on my extroverted personality, and there were plenty of new things to worry about (such as the possibility of the Delta variant).</p><p>The most bedeviling thing about patronizing online stores such as Amazon and Apple, my planner advised me, is that they make it hard to track how much you're spending and what you're spending on. Nearly 10 minutes went by before I even realized some of those \"Amazon.com\" charges on my checking account were for groceries via Fresh delivery.</p><p>\"There's still a big portion that's not groceries,\" she retorted with playful shade, robbing me of an opportunity to defend myself against my emotional overspending.</p><p>She was right, though. Apparently my Amazon purchases also tipped off my planner to another behavior she was seeing in her other clients: home improvement. Or, in my case, home furnishing. I had traded my tiny shared apartment for a more spacious one-bedroom spot, which I had all to myself.</p><p>The breathing room was wonderful—especially during a pandemic—but the newly renovated extra space also meant buying a sofa and a dining table and a bookshelf and a clothes rack (because New York has convinced us that closets don't matter) and a microwave and a kitchen cart, and on and on until my concern, along with my credit-card limit, was nearing its apex.</p><p>Again, my planner assured me that this, too, was natural—apparently I was among the 28% of consumers who have been investing in new uses of their living spaces during the pandemic, which some have dubbed the \"homebody economy.\" Those who have been privileged enough to work from home through the pandemic have taken steps to make it feel like a sanctuary, she explained, because of all the time spent there.</p><p>My checking account also revealed my need for connection after a time of unprecedented isolation. Yes, there were the bottomless brunches and outdoor happy hours with friends and colleagues, all of us eager to spend time with an organic being who wasn't a Monstera plant, poodle or partner. But this need also manifested in a sudden willingness to spend $60 on nice dinner dates with men I was meeting for the first time, rather than the more circumspect (and cheaper) weekend coffee.</p><p>Scale it back</p><p>Most of my financial planner's suggestions were valuable and enlightening, and will likely stay with me for life. She emphasized the importance of creating different purposes for my checking, savings and credit-card accounts to gain better control of my cash flow, rather than approach my earnings like eating from a \"big pot\" at a buffet. She created budget line items for the things that were clearly important to me, such as \"housing\" and \"therapy,\" rather than suggest ways to reel them in. Fifty-dollar brunches would need to give way to outdoor picnics and vaccinated game nights—at least until my credit cards were paid off. Then, I could celebrate such wins with a nice meal, graphic novel or item from my Amazon wish list.</p><p>As much as I was buoyed by what felt like a transformative session, though, I couldn't shake the feeling that at least some of these lessons may have to be reinforced. There were so many imminent variables that could potentially throw my fresh pandemic budget off track: Will I have less discretionary dollars when hybrid work resumes, and I'll have to refill my MetroCard and face the temptation of midtown restaurants at lunchtime? If I decide to leave New York, as so many of my friends and peers have, would moving be a boon or (another) bust for my finances?</p><p>Whatever happens, I think I'll at least be a little more prepared this time.</p><p>Write to J.J. McCorvey.</p><p>I Was Saving a Lot of Money During Lockdown. But Then It All Changed.</p>",
