  "text": "<p>Hong Kong police have arrested 53 pro-democracy politicians in one of the biggest purges of the city's opposition since Beijing imposed a tough new national security law on the city last year. </p> <p>Among those detained were moderate former democratic lawmakers and human rights lawyer John Clancey — a US citizen who is believed to be one of the first expatriates arrested under the law.</p> <p>Police also for the first time accused the city's most prominent pro-democracy activist, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11b3cfba-f70a-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654\">Joshua Wong</a>, of violating the national security law. Crimes under the law are punishable with up to life imprisonment. </p> <p>The arrests targeted activists and politicians who were involved in a primary run-off last year to determine which opposition candidates would run in elections for the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's de facto parliament. The city's government subsequently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/235bb4b5-bfaa-4f62-b49a-231c1fb0d5b6\">postponed the election</a>, which was scheduled for last September, citing the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>The sweeping action on Wednesday marks a severe escalation of a crackdown following the imposition of the national security law in June, which critics say <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75313efa-e44b-4f73-9cd0-41a045f62749\">threatens freedoms</a> promised to the semi-autonomous territory under its handover to China by the UK in 1997. </p> <p>Beijing introduced the law following last year's anti-government protests.</p> <p>Senior superintendent Steve Li, of the Hong Kong police national security department, said 1,000 officers were deployed to arrest people for “subversion under the national security law”.</p> <p>Police also froze about HK$1.6m (US$206,378) in funds, raided 72 locations and demanded documents from four media organisations.</p> <p>News groups including pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, In-Media and Stand News said they received police document requests.</p> <p>In Beijing, Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said the “police action was necessary”, adding that the “SAR government cannot tolerate crimes of subverting the state power”.</p> <p>On Wednesday, police searched the home of Mr Wong, who is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/743fafac-b9f6-490f-b06d-c142868f2865\">in prison for other offences</a>, and accused him of contravening the security law, according to the activist's official social media pages.</p> <p>Former lawmakers James To, Andrew Wan, Lam Cheuk-ting, Wu Chi-wai, and Roy Kwong were also among those arrested.</p> <p>The pro-democracy lawmakers had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a1d9ae-d238-4e34-a6f0-c04f8cc4c6b5\">resigned</a> from the Legislative Council last year as part of a mass boycott of the body by opposition politicians after the government disqualified four of their colleagues. The resignations left the de facto rubber-stamp parliament effectively devoid of opposition. </p> <p>Hong Kong's opposition Democratic Party said police had linked the arrests to the primary run-offs and accused its members of violating the national security law, according to the party's Facebook page.</p> <p>“The wave of arrests is part of an ongoing pattern of squeezing out the last remaining spaces for action by the democratic opposition&#xa0;in Hong Kong,&#xa0;and at times taking advantage of moments when leaders and citizens in other parts of the world are distracted by domestic news cycles,” said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a China historian at the University of California.</p> <p>The round-up also followed fears that political pressure from Beijing is threatening the independence of Hong Kong's globally respected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d08b540f-f124-437b-976c-013c431f61cc\">judicial system</a>, considered essential to its role as an international financial hub. </p> <p>On Monday, Geoffrey Ma, the outgoing chief justice, indirectly raised concerns about growing calls from pro-China groups in the city for changes to the legal system.</p> <p>Pro-Beijing groups have challenged court decisions in which defendants facing charges related to the 2019 protests were acquitted or handed what government supporters considered lenient sentences. </p> <p>“If there is any reform required, give us the details and we will consider it,” Justice Ma said on Wednesday ahead of his retirement this week. “But it's not particularly satisfactory [if] there is a call for reform simply on the basis of a result one doesn't like.”</p> <p>Justice Ma insisted, however, that he had not faced pressure from Beijing in deciding cases. “Do I have any direct interference with what I do or what the courts do from the government or from Beijing? The answer is no,” he said.</p> <p>Antony Blinken, US president-elect Joe Biden's nominee for US secretary of state, said the incoming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/853c5e5c-f7dd-4231-b84d-a8f3cf1faa35\">administration would support</a> “the people of Hong Kong”.</p> <p>“The sweeping arrests of pro-democracy demonstrators are an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights,” Mr Blinken wrote on Twitter. “The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy.”</p> <p>Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, said that in light of the latest crackdown it would be “a massive strategic blunder” for the EU to sign an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a429460-4bfb-42d4-9191-73ba97dde130\">investment deal with China</a>. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/30fa4b60-2dba-4bc2-b601-30d0a2d5daee.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f12b24f7-90f6-44a0-9e46-7f3d9c9ec399\"><em>Crackdown highlights territory's new normal</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f12b24f7-90f6-44a0-9e46-7f3d9c9ec399\"><em>From Benjamin L Tsang, New Territories, Hong Kong</em></a></p><p>Source: Primrose Riordan and Nicolle Liu in Hong Kong 2021 'Hong Kong police round up dozens of pro-democracy politicians' FT.com 6 January.
