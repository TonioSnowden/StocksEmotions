  "text": "<h1>Due Diligence live: the highlight reel</h1> <p>What happens when you gather hundreds of Due Diligence subscribers and the biggest names in M&amp;A, private equity, and corporate finance to discuss how they're confronting tumultuous markets, a dealmaking slowdown, and rising geopolitical tensions (to name just a few of the challenges on the horizon)?</p> <p>A lot of bullishness on private equity. And some unfiltered commentary on Spacs, among other things.</p> <p>Today's newsletter looks at the highlights from our full-day inaugural Due Diligence Live event. If you missed your chance to watch the sessions, you can still register to <a href=\"https://duediligence.live.ft.com/agenda\">catch all of the action on-demand here</a>.</p> <h2>1. The UK is up for sale</h2> <p>When <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> declared last year that the UK would make it “easier than ever for the world to benefit from what we have to offer”, he didn't expect overseas corporate raiders to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79e6ec3e-e869-4c77-beef-938c306ed7bc\">take him so seriously</a>. Chancellor <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong>'s disastrous “mini” Budget has now sweetened the deal.</p> <p>The plummeting value of sterling means that “everything in the UK is on sale”, said <strong>Blair Jacobson</strong>, co-head of European credit at<strong> Ares Management</strong> at DD Live.</p> <p>Following deals like <strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d990b0f-2728-4126-adee-d4111aae7a45\">purchase</a> of <strong>Wm Morrison</strong> and the takeover of <strong>G4S</strong>, US dealmakers continue to ramp up their shopping spree in the UK.</p> <p>The activity could help jump-start a comeback in M&amp;A. “The first wave of M&amp;A coming out of this is private equity-driven not corporate-driven,” <strong>Blair Effron</strong>, co-founder of&#xa0; investment bank <strong>Centerview Partners</strong>, told DD.</p> <p>DD's Kaye Wiggins and Antoine Gara <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4a54ef9-3ef7-4ab1-b87b-211f779a4299?shareType=nongift\">have the full story</a>.</p> <h2>2. The future of private capital</h2> <p>One big takeaway: dealmaking is likely to increasingly involve listed companies being taken private, said Ares' Jacobson. “The delisting trend will continue . . . we've been major beneficiaries of that trend.”</p> <p>Deep-pocketed investors in the Middle East could also become an important source of cash as pension funds become more strapped for cash, he added.</p> <p>Private equity is becoming increasingly liquid, said <strong>Further Global</strong> managing partner&#xa0;<strong>Olivier Sarkozy</strong>, giving it a “massive advantage” compared to public markets. Retail investors present “a massive untapped pool of capital that is going to come into the industry and propel it forward”, he added.</p> <p>Watch the full panel <a href=\"https://duediligence.live.ft.com/agenda/session/868738\">here</a>.</p> <h2>3. Rough days ahead for crypto and Spacs</h2> <p>“There is no way a government could function if it cannot tax its population . . . if crypto ever became sufficiently embedded it would become illegal,” Sarkozy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftlive/status/1580197243469983744\">told DD</a>.</p> <p>The financier also didn't hold back about Wall Street's fleeting love affair with Spacs. “The Spac market was a joke in my view. I hope I am not offending anybody.”&#xa0;</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftlive/status/1580197243469983744\">https://twitter.com/ftlive/status/1580197243469983744 </a> <p>“Having been on the front end of a number of crypto restructurings . . . it is very difficult to see and value what they are worth,” said <strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> global head of private capital <strong>Yen Sum</strong>, adding that she believes the crypto asset class will see more liquidations.</p> <h2>4. ESG is in need of a refresh</h2> <p>The recent backlash surrounding companies' environmental, social and governance rhetoric was warranted, said <strong>Desiree Fixler</strong>, chair of <strong>VentureESG</strong> and former<strong> DWS</strong> executive whose whistleblower allegations on greenwashing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50f5c4a1-5ebe-40cc-a89f-2952f58ba324\">prompted a police investigation</a> into the German asset manager.</p> <p>“I am actually very bullish on sustainable investments today,” she told DD's Ortenca Aliaj. “There was a green asset bubble . . . <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5685fb73-8018-4ef0-bfd3-fd70e6aa0cbb\">COP26</a> was a vanity project, whereas today you have to get real.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The consensus overall is that meaningful change won't be possible without co-operation between the public and private sectors. “The narrative that the private sector can solve this <a href=\"https://duediligence.live.ft.com/agenda/session/868741\">is absolutely nonsensical</a>,” said <strong>Tariq Fancy</strong>, <strong>BlackRock</strong>'s former head of sustainable investing.</p> <h2>5. The rise of shareholder activism</h2> <p>From its (so far unsuccessful) <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/891f4e2f-01fd-4c15-9c3d-21d767885cce\">campaign at Richemont</a> to taking on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/891f4e2f-01fd-4c15-9c3d-21d767885cce\"><strong>GSK</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f5a8c43-76d4-4843-a15e-47bc767ec6d8\"><strong>Glencore</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd369552-8491-40a2-b83b-9a1b2e32407a\"><strong>Danone</strong></a>, <strong>Bluebell Capital Partners</strong> has risen to become a feared activist despite its small size.</p> <p>The London-based fund's co-founder and co-investment chief<strong> Marco Taricco </strong><a href=\"https://duediligence.live.ft.com/agenda/session/944999\">told DD</a> that working constructively with company boards has resulted in a more profitable era of activism. “I would argue that private equity does exactly what we do — just in private markets.”</p> <p>“There is a misconception that the influence over a company is tied to the amount of shares we own,” added <strong>Clearway Capital</strong> founder <strong>Gianluca Ferrari</strong>.</p> <h2>6. The ethics of short selling are debatable</h2> <p>Short sellers have had their fair share of criticism, from some blaming hedge funds for <strong>Deliveroo</strong>'s ill-received listing, aka “the worst IPO in London's history” to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd1f9a85-fa58-4152-bf63-e40bc1e1d61c\"><strong>GameStop </strong>saga</a>. </p> <p>But should they be required to disclose their short positions? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftlive/status/1580227666103664641\">Here's a thought-provoking debate</a> between <a href=\"https://duediligence.live.ft.com/agenda/speakers/1710128\"><strong>Safkhet Capital Management</strong></a> founder and chief investment officer <strong>Fahmi Quadir</strong> and the FT's Dan McCrum on the subject.</p> <h2>7. There's a new regime for M&amp;A antitrust</h2> <p>US <strong>Department of Justice</strong> antitrust chief <strong>Jonathan Kanter</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f4cc882-1444-4ea3-8a31-c382364aace1\">has made it no secret</a> in recent months that private equity is on his radar as the industry's top players morph into powerful diversified conglomerates controlling vast swaths of the economy.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://duediligence.live.ft.com/agenda/session/868742\">goes into further detail in conversation</a> with DD's Javier Espinoza.</p> <p>“Private equity raises a range of considerations that can lead to antitrust issues, whether it's deal roll-ups, or interlocking board directors,” he said.</p> <h2>8. The finalists for the Chelsea Football Club takeover </h2> <p>More than 250 potential buyers had expressed interest in buying Russian oligarch <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong>'s football club that was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7385ebc-d657-4116-be0f-96497e5f8d99\">eventually sold</a> to a consortium led by US financier <strong>Todd Boehly </strong>and California-based investment firm <strong>Clearlake Capital</strong>.</p> <p>“We had some people representing various governments, we had crypto millionaires . . .” said <strong>Raine Group</strong> partner <strong>Colin Neville</strong>. Many of those suitors backed out due to “being uncomfortable with the geopolitics” and/or “the fact that there were no reps and warranties in the deal”, he added.</p> <p>In the end, the decision boiled down to four finalists: Boehly and Clearlake, a group led by the <strong>Ricketts</strong> family (which owns the<strong> Chicago Cubs</strong> baseball team) and <strong>Citadel</strong>'s<strong> Ken Griffin</strong>; a group led by <strong>Apollo</strong>'s <strong>Josh Harris</strong> and<strong> Blackstone</strong>'s<strong> David Blitzer</strong>; and a group led by<strong> Boston Celtics </strong>co-owner <strong>Steve Pagliuca</strong>, Neville told DD.</p> <p>Watch the conversation <a href=\"https://duediligence.live.ft.com/agenda/session/944998\">here</a>.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Nader Haffar</strong>, the head of <strong>KPMG</strong>'s Dubai business, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19fede69-7d1c-44b6-a519-d63b197a98bd\">is stepping down</a> from the firm following a wave of allegations of nepotism, cronyism and partner discontent. Deals partner <strong>Anshul Gupta</strong> and former head of audit <strong>Emilio Pera</strong> are both expected to run in an upcoming election for the top job, said people familiar with the details.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Comcast</strong> has promoted chief financial officer<strong> Mike Cavanagh </strong>to the added role of president. He was previously co-chief executive of <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>'s corporate and investment bank from 2012 to 2014.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Wells Fargo</strong> has hired<strong> Evercore</strong>'s <strong>Sesh Raghavan</strong> as a managing director and its new head of power, utilities and renewables mergers and acquisitions.</p></li>  <li><p>Boutique investment bank <strong>William Blair</strong> has hired<strong> Dominic Emery</strong> as a managing director in London. He joins from <strong>Raymond James</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Danger zone </strong>Abrdn's £1.5bn acquisition of Interactive Investor has only dragged the ailing UK asset manager's share price down further. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/476bf108-3743-4da8-8622-5760fd2c1538\">the merger is only the tip of the iceberg</a>, writes the FT's Cat Rutter Pooley.</p> <p><strong>Past their prime </strong>Long-short stockpickers used to carry a certain cache on Wall Street. But poor performance in the sector <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/hedge-funds-stock-picks-fail-to-shield-investors-from-bear-market?srnd=premium&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall\">has dented the reputations</a> of these once lauded hedge fund wizards, Bloomberg writes.</p> <p><strong>Made in India </strong>As global companies look to hedge their reliance on China, India has seized its opportunity to challenge Beijing's manufacturing dominance. Apple's new deal in New Delhi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d655fde6-6213-49c8-b38b-a2be3ecbb7fe\">will serve as a critical test</a>, writes the FT's John Reed.</p> <p><strong>And here's a smart listen:</strong> Trevor Milton and his electric vehicle start-up Nikola's Spac-fuelled rise to fame was swiftly shot down by a short-seller attack and subsequent fraud charges. The FT's Claire Bushey breaks down the saga as Milton's trial plays out in New York.
