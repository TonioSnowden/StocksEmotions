  "text": "<p>The average life expectancy of a new year's resolution is two and a half weeks. Or maybe 32 days, 17 hours and three turns of a pepper mill. It depends on whether you ask Alexa, Siri or Google. Who measures these things? And how? And why? </p> <p>We don't need stats to tell us that resolutions are a futile exercise. It's at this point in the year that we start coming to terms with not writing that novel, not taking that class, not being thinner or better or more resolute, just our same old selves.</p> <p>But we remain hopelessly optimistic, we can't resist the promise of a new beginning. My strategy this year was to go for a small resolution. I wanted to drop from my conversation all the words that had colonised it in 2020: “pandemic”, plus “lockdown” and “bubble” in the context of human connection. Mostly I came to loathe “unprecedented”. In the new year — I thought — I will drop these for beautiful and exciting words: “lambent”, “renascent”, “porphyrogennetos”...</p> <p>My resolution was an epic fail from the off. It's hard to form a sentence without “pandemic”, we're still in lockdown; things are still unprecedented.</p> <p>I've had more success with my other resolution, celebrating the good little moments: the joys of a hot shower, some winter sun, a bowl of hot soup.</p> <p>Bean and barley soup is a staple in Ashkenazi homes and Jewish delis, the weekday counterpart to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef51d2d0-1116-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277\">the stately chicken soup</a>. It holds its own kind of magic. From few ingredients comes a thick, velvety broth that is rich and nourishing — pearls of barley and soft savoury beans that roll from the spoon and melt on the tongue.</p> <p>It may be a bit bland in its pure form but it takes well to variations — if you have a few bones from last night's roast, smokey sausage or leftover brisket, for example, they will be very welcome additions. We&#xa0;add the tiniest bit of spice — we can't help it — and beetroot, not only for the gorgeous tint but also because its sweet, earthy flavour lifts this humble soup, making it porphyrogennetos: born in the purple, made for greatness.</p> <h2>Beetroot, borlotti bean and barley soup</h2> <p>A generous pot of hearty soup for weekdays (about six to eight portions)</p> <ol>  <li><p>Place the dried borlotti in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. (If&#xa0;you use tinned beans, strain, cover with fresh water and bring to the boil.) Add the barley, boil for a further five minutes and strain. </p></li>  <li><p>While the beans are cooking, chop all the vegetables into large chunks that can easily go into a food processor. Start with the beetroot, setting aside 150g, then pulse the rest until you get a rough barley-like consistency and size; remove to a bowl. Blitz the rest of the vegetables until they are the same texture and mix them all together (apart from the small amount of beets you set aside).</p></li>  <li><p>Pour the olive oil into a large saucepan then add the blitzed vegetables and salt. Set on a medium-high heat and sauté for 15 minutes to soften a little, stirring occasionally. Add&#xa0;the boiled beans and barley and cover with the water. Bring to a boil, skim any foam that bubbles up then reduce the heat and add all the spices. Semi-cover the pot and cook for 30 minutes or until the beans are soft. </p></li>  <li><p>Meanwhile, wash the parsley or the beetroot leaves and chop roughly. Add them to the retained beetroots, then add both to the soup. Mix well and cook for 10 minutes before serving. If&#xa0;you are eating this over a few days, you may need to add a little water on a daily basis and adjust the seasoning lightly as the barley continues to absorb liquids.</p></li> </ol> <p><em>Email Sarit and Itamar at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=honeyandco@ft.com\"><em>honeyandco@ft.com</em></a><em>&#xa0;and follow them on Instagram&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/honeyandco/?hl=en\"><em>@Honeyandco</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
