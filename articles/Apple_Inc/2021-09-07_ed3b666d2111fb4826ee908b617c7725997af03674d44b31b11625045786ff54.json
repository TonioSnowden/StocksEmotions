  "text": "<p>That ever-present reality is precisely the point of \"America After 9/11,\" a \"Frontline\" presentation. Has there ever been an \"after\" as regards 9/11? The show traces the repercussions of the catastrophic attack though four presidential administrations, two wars and a litany of decisions, some bad, arriving in a country polarized and angry after two decades of unmet expectations and broken promises. The events of 9/11 occurred 20 years ago, but \"America After 9/11\" (which made its debut Tuesday at 9 p.m., but is available on PBS.org/frontline YouTube and the PBS Video App) renders them as immediate as our withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p><p>Similarly, other programs concerned with 9/11 are most successful when they assume a specific focus. History (as in the channel) has four documentaries on its commemorative schedule, including \"Rise and Fall: The World Trade Center\" (Friday, 8 p.m.), an architect's-eye view of the conception, construction and destruction of the towers. On Saturday, it will present \"Four Flights\" (8 p.m.), featuring stories and reminiscences from families and friends of those who'd been aboard the various 9/11 planes (the two diverted to New York; the one that hit the Pentagon; and United 93, which crashed in Somerset County, Pa., after passengers and crew tried to overwhelm its hijackers). On Saturday, Apple TV+ will present, for free, \"9/11: Inside the President's War Room,\" which features interviews with a presumably knowledgeable cast of characters—George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Powell and Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Andrew Card—all of whom offer the well-trod and specifically White House narrative about how 9/11 unfolded. The narrator is Jeff Daniels.</p><p>Although it requires some generosity, the surfeit of 9/11 programming can be viewed as an attempt by Greater Television to make the historical record complete. It's remarkable how well the various venues have gotten out of each other's way, although no single account of 9/11 was going to be able to compete with National Geographic's \"9/11: One Day in America\" (first aired Aug. 29, encoring on NatGeo Friday and Saturday at 9 p.m. and streaming on Hulu). It's a tour de force.</p><p>What makes it so? Not just the exhaustive attention to detail, or the emotional interviews with first-responders and ordinary citizens, or the amount of footage you can't quite believe exists. The series is deliberately, painstakingly, enthrallingly thorough—so much so that the impact of the second plane into the south tower doesn't occur until halfway through the feature-length opener. (The rest of the six episodes are 40-odd minutes long.) Director Daniel Bogado and his editors, Chris Nicholls and Audinga Kucinskaite, assume a pace that results in a thriller of Hitchcockian proportions. And an assemblage of constantly surprising elements.</p><p>Fire Department Battalion Chief Joseph Pfeifer, for instance, was checking a gas leak at Church and Lispenard streets in Tribeca—and being filmed for reasons unexplained—when the first plane hit the north tower about a dozen blocks south. What follows is a kind of immersive visual hot-pursuit of a story that unfolds not just through the official records, or all that remarkable, random Fire Department footage, but the memories of unlikely people—businessman Ron Clifford, who happened to be at the World Trade Center for a meeting and ended up cradling a burn victim in its lobby, even as the building was getting ready to fall. Or chef Kevin Leary, who emerged after 15 minutes in his restaurant's walk-in refrigerator to find his entire building in shambles. Or Jay Jonas, a member of a group of firefighters who \"took the time to shake each other's hands . . . and wish each other good luck\" before beginning their ascent up the trade center stairs. And was the only one who came back down.</p><p>Strictly in terms of storytelling, there's an interesting contrast to be drawn between \"One Day in America\" and \"Turning Point: 9/11 and the War on Terror,\" which is currently on Netflix. Watching the former, viewers are constantly off balance—not about what will ultimately happen, but about what they will be shown en route to a cataclysmic denouement. \"Turning Point\" sets up the events of 9/11 in a far more routine way, although the ultimate objective of the five-part series—tracking the motives of the 9/11 perpetrators not just to the 1993 bombing and its attendant plots, but as far back as the 1980s—is a far different one.</p><p>Although it might sound frivolous, one of the more moving specials about 9/11 turns out to be \"Too Soon: Comedy After 9/11\" (Wednesday, 9 p.m., Vice TV). Directed by Julie Seabaugh and Nick Fituri Scown, it's less about the resilience of comedians, or their audiences, and more about the emotional dilemma that funny people found themselves in during the days after 9/11. Could they be funny? Did funny matter anymore? Where was the line between bad taste and really bad taste? The title, as some might remember, refers to the Comedy Central Friars Club roast of Hugh Hefner on Sept. 29, at which Gilbert Gottfried told a 9/11 joke. \"I don't think anyone's lost an audience bigger than I did at that point,\" Mr. Gottfried has said. Someone in the crowd yelled out \"too soon,\" providing the title and the subject of the special. When exactly is too soon?</p><p>Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick talk about \"The Producers\" at some length—their massive hit show took only a few days off before opening again; people need to laugh, albeit tentatively at first. \"Too Soon\" also features David Cross, Janeane Garofalo, Mr. Gottfried, Cedric the Entertainer, Marc Maron, Aasif Mandvi, Rob Riggle (a first responder himself) and Lewis Black, among others, and is a very funny show—which will probably make some people feel guilty. But its point is about our need to treat the blackest moments with humor, to tell jokes at the figurative funeral.</p><p>Speaking of which: For those who just might need a dose of heightened humanity, affirmation and elevation, the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday will present a special live performance of Verdi's \"Requiem,\" conducted by Met music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin and hosted by Misty Copeland, from the site of the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum (8 p.m., PBS). The great composer wrote the piece in memory of the poet Alessandro Manzoni, a proponent of Italian unification. American unification has always been cited as an immediate aftereffect of 9/11. All the commemorative programs acknowledge it. With any hope, they may even promote it.</p><p>A Stream of Shows Marks September 11</p>",
