  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>All eyes turn to Strasbourg today as EU legislators cast their ballots on whether to include gas and nuclear on the list of sustainable investments. We'll hear what the mood is among MEPs and how the fight about climate-related policies is likely to continue. </p> <p>In London, the position of prime minister Boris Johnson became more unstable last night when chancellor Rishi Sunak and health secretary Sajid Javid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cb6646e-6d58-40a9-9f36-7ec1ccf9363c\">resigned from the cabinet within minutes</a> of each other following a row over the premier's honesty. </p> <p>Meanwhile in North Macedonia, pressure is mounting on the country to accept a negotiating framework put forward by the former French EU presidency. </p> <p>And we'll look at the challenges ahead after MEPs yesterday rubber-stamped two landmark pieces of legislation aimed at regulating Big Tech. </p> <h2>Green label struggles</h2> <p>Few topics have animated those gathered for the European parliament's pre-summer plenary this week as much as today's vote on the controversial proposal to classify gas and nuclear as green investments under the bloc's financial labelling “taxonomy”, writes <em><strong>Alice Hancock in Strasbourg.</strong></em></p> <p>The taxonomy, designed as a guide for investors to channel funds towards more environmentally friendly projects, is the divisive topic <em>du jour</em>. </p> <p>Those that want to reject the European Commission's designation of gas and nuclear as “green” investments under certain circumstances, such as the Socialists and Greens, have been making frantic calculations as they try to convince colleagues that the move will undermine the EU's green credentials and gift Vladimir Putin more European custom for Russian gas.</p> <p>“Russian gas cannot be the solution to the [climate] problems that the European Union is trying to tackle with this taxonomy,” said Inna Sovsun, a Ukrainian MP who addressed journalists at the parliament yesterday.</p> <p>But Mairead McGuinness, financial services commissioner, told MEPs in the chamber that the taxonomy would not “deepen our dependence on Russian gas”, vehemently adding that she had never referred to gas or nuclear as “green” but only as transition fuels for member states moving away from “dirty fossil fuels”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Most legislators speaking to Europe Express admitted that although the vote will be tight, with about 620 MEPs present at the plenary and 353 MEPs needed to vote in a simple majority against the act, it is unlikely that the naysayers will succeed.</p> <p>But all bets are off. Some MEPs favour nuclear but not gas and do not know which way to vote when the two are lumped together in one act. Others are angry at the commission for not consulting parliament earlier.</p> <p>The European People's party, the parliament's largest grouping, said last night that it would vote in favour of labelling gas and nuclear as green. But several of its members are expected to vote against, in line with their national stance on nuclear or views on the need for gas. </p> <p>If the vote confirms the inclusion of gas and nuclear in taxonomy, the fights will continue in other areas that are still up for debate, such as financing the bloc's energy transition and ways to counter the rising price of gas and electricity.</p> <h1>Chart du jour: Euro slide</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5795f52f-36e0-45a5-bed6-f939e5535814\"><em>Read more here </em></a><em>about why the euro hit its weakest level against the dollar in two decades yesterday, amid a worsening sentiment about the global outlook.</em> </p> <h2>Under pressure</h2> <p>North Macedonia is on the brink of accepting a compromise deal that would unblock the EU's stalled enlargement process in the western Balkans, writes <em><strong>Marton Dunai in Budapest.</strong></em><br><br>“I come to Skopje at a crucial moment for North Macedonia but also a crucial moment of the EU,” European Council president Charles Michel said yesterday in a joint press conference with North Macedonian prime minister Dimitar Kovačevski in Skopje.<br><br>North Macedonia and Albania, whose membership applications are lumped together by Brussels, have been held up for more than two years by a veto from Bulgaria, which demanded a recognition of a historical connection between the countries in the North Macedonian constitution and improved rights for a Bulgarian minority.</p> <p>The French EU presidency in its final weeks put forward a negotiating framework that had been already approved by the Bulgarian side, but which North Macedonia still has to accept. </p> <p>It is not a popular deal. In recent days, thousands have taken to the streets in Skopje voicing their opposition to the French proposal, which <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/north-macedonia-nationalist-protesters-reject-french-eu-proposal/a-62342216\">protesters denounced</a> as a step to “assimilation” and which the opposition decried as “<a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/macedonia-bulgaria-eu-france/31928792.html\">Bulgarisation</a>”. </p> <p>Kovačevski said he would still have to put the proposals through parliament, a move expected in the next few days. His fragile coalition faces internal disputes about the French proposal, as well as vocal opposition from the nationalist party that organised the protests. The PM yesterday defended the French proposal and said it included “clear and unambiguous acceptance of the Macedonian language. It gives us what we have fought for years.”<br><br>“We are on the brink of a breakthrough,” Michel said. “If you say yes, the first intergovernmental conference (the initial step of membership talks) will be organised in the next few days. The next steps will follow immediately.”<br><br>Michel said the membership and the choices in Skopje must be viewed through the lens of the war in Ukraine.<br><br>“I hope this choice will reflect this aspiration for the free world . . . This is a fundamental choice for the future. And certainly the war launched by Russia against Ukraine shows us (this). What do we want for this country? What do we want for the western Balkans? We are (offering) you a clear choice, a clear vision.”</p> <p>Michel's visit comes hot on the heels of similar “encouragement” trips from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThomasByrneTD/status/1544045901257347074\">foreign ministers of Sweden and Ireland</a> and as the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, tweeted about the merits of letting North Macedonia join the EU. No pressure. </p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeSullivan46/status/1543758106487840768\">https://twitter.com/JakeSullivan46/status/1543758106487840768</a> <h2>Challenges ahead</h2> <p>The European parliament yesterday adopted the final text of the Digital Markets Act, a landmark piece of legislation aimed at curbing the market power of the likes of Google and Apple, but there are plenty enforcement challenges ahead, writes <em><strong>Javier Espinoza in Brussels</strong>.</em></p> <p>Regulators in Europe were supposed to find it hard to enact new rules against Big Tech given their strong lobbying against legislation aimed at opening up competition, but they passed them in record time.</p> <p>Instead, the challenges EU officials are now facing are related to implementation. Here are some of issues ahead:</p> <p><strong>Staffing</strong>: MEP Andreas Schwab, who led the discussions at the European parliament, has been pushing for a bigger budget to recruit 150 more staff as the commission will have to fight against highly experienced and expensive lawyers defending tech giants like Apple. The original number the commission anticipated to enforce the DMA was just 80. “We need to upgrade the manpower and the womanpower in this area but it is a question at the discretion of the commission,” he said. “We need lawyers and economists but we also need data specialists and people that can analyse algorithms but it will not be easy if they work for the gatekeepers.”</p> <p><strong>Legal challenges: </strong>Experts believe that tech companies will challenge the legal basis of the law, the designation as so-called gatekeepers as they seek to delay antitrust action. It is unclear who will move first but Big Tech companies have for years been fighting against Brussels' accusations of alleged anti competitive behaviour. Legal experts expect Big Tech to be strategic. “I expect them to be selective. They may challenge one thing but not necessarily another,” said Assimakis Komninos, a partner at law firm White &amp; Case.</p> <p><strong>Loopholes: </strong>Legislators are actively working on closing loopholes that might prevent Big Tech from paying fines or continue to engage in anti competitive behaviour. Schwab moved last month to close a “technical loop” that would have allowed the likes of Apple and Amazon to avoid paying millions of euros in fines should they be found to be breaking EU law. “We are starting a new era of tech regulation,” Schwab said.</p> <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>Czech prime minister Petr Fiala presents priorities of his country's rotating EU presidency</p></li>  <li><p>European parliament votes on green label for gas and nuclear investments</p></li> </ol> <h1>Notable, Quotable </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>ECB strife: </strong>The head of Germany's Bundesbank has warned that it will be “virtually impossible” to decide if a divergence in borrowing costs between eurozone countries is justified, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bb8c116-bc64-4d28-a26e-9bb7aada6751\">first sign of serious disagreement at the ECB </a>over its plan to develop a new asset purchase tool.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Norwegian disruption:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd5a3c33-03bc-4434-8465-9d306b8885da\">temporary shutdown at Norway's oil and gas producer</a> Equinor is intensifying Europe's supply woes as the continent is seeking to wean itself off Russian fossil fuel imports.
