  "text": "<p>The angst of the writing life is a regular theme in Stephen King's horror fiction, but constructing a plot around the difficulties of handling a deceased author's literary estate seems niche even for him. Add in a demented fan, however, and things get interesting, especially with Julianne Moore, Joan Allen and Jennifer Jason Leigh playing very weird sisters in King's adaptation of his own novel. </p> <p>Literary widows from Mary Shelley to Sonia Orwell and Valerie Eliot traditionally engender resentment over their control of their late husband's work. Lisey (Moore), the wealthy relict of cult author Scott Landon (Clive Owen), presides over a basement full of unpublished work that aficionados would love to get their hands on. Professor “Dash” Dashiel (Ron Cephas Jones) is naive, if not dim, when he dispatches a random Landon stan to “persuade” Lisey to hand over the papers which she's “sitting on . . . like a broody hen”. </p> <p>Jim Dooley (Dane DeHaan at his most bruised and unblinking) first came to Dash's attention because of the “extraordinary insights” into Landon's work he posted on a website. They meet in a bar where Dash seems not to notice that Jim is a little bit extra. Instead he delivers the hilarious line, “I thought if I interviewed you it would add some texture to my forthcoming book.” </p> <p>Worry not, fans of Clive Owen, there are lots of flashbacks to the Landons' marriage, which get creepier every time habitual cutter Scott says: “The Landons are fast healers.” He also behaves very strangely around taps and running water, and can seemingly escape from locked bathrooms. Love is not only blind, it's also handy with a mop. </p> <p>Landon appeals both to the masses and the literary cognoscenti despite churning out commercial whoppers, but it's all to do with the magical land he created as a child with his older brother Paul as an escape from their violent father (a great turn from Michael Pitt). Paul (Clark Furlong, very touching) also invented a game, the “bool hunt”, to cheer his brother up. In similar fashion, Landon has left a string of clues for his grieving widow to follow. How did he die anyway, since he seems to have survived the shooting by another crazed fan when he cut the ribbon at the new town library. Landons are fast healers, remember?</p> <p>The photography is lavish and painterly, though it would be hard to make the Maine woods look anything less than glorious. While Jim creeps ever closer in his cinematic yellow cagoule, Lisey floats around the pool like a Pre-Raphaelite stunner, as though her only ambition is to be the top-selling postcard in Tate Britain. But she's a lot handier with a spade than Ophelia.</p> <p>★★★★★</p> <p><em>Available on Apple TV Plus from June 4</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Suzi Feay 2021 'Julianne Moore and Clive Owen star in literary thriller Lisey's Story' FT.com 28 May.
