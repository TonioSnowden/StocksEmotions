  "text": "<p>As regular readers know, we launched FT Edit as an experiment. </p> <p>We deliberately built a simple app so that we could add new features according to demand. </p> <p>Right from the beginning, the most requested feature was an iPad edition. </p> <p>(We got some pretty scathing reviews in the app store too, including one person who said it was a “disgrace” that we didn't have an iPad version.) </p> <p>Anyway, the good news for iPad lovers is that we launched an iPad edition this week. You can get it from the App Store now. </p> <p>After speaking to the experts at Apple we decided to make it a landscape, rather than portrait, app, but otherwise it retains all the simplicity and focus of the iPhone FT Edit, and we hope its minimal design will help you engage more with the journalism inside. </p> <p>As ever, please let us know what you think at ftedit@ft.com, and also let us know what feature you would like to see us build next. And finally, if you are enjoying the app, please spread the news! </p> <p><strong>Sneak preview of what's coming next:</strong> To finish off the year in style, we'll have 12 days of good news stories. </p> <h1>Our favourite pieces</h1> <p>• One of the most eye-catching stories this week came when the FT broke the news that US scientists had made a breakthrough in nuclear fusion, raising hopes of a clean and abundant new source of energy. Tom Wilson, the journalist who got the story, also wrote this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ff76541-ebdc-43ed-bf4e-4faa75fcf2f9\">essential explanation</a> of what happened and what it means. <br><strong>Malcolm Moore</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalcolmMoore\"><em>(@malcolmmoore)</em></a> <br><em>Editor, FT Edit</em></p> <p>• As it's almost Christmas I, like a lot of other people, have been agonising over finding the perfect gift. But for the last few years, one thing that always works well is any book from the Folio Society. So it was great to feature a story this week about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d1744f-804f-4d0e-ad74-09a0d5df5c88\">bookseller's success</a> and the art of making beautiful books. <br><strong>David Hindley</strong><br><em>Researcher, FT Edit</em> <em>(</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidHindleyFT\"><em>@DavidHindleyFT</em></a>)</p> <h1>Something to listen to </h1> <p><strong>Money clinic —</strong> If you've been following the news of FTX, it might seem like crypto has a perilous future.

There are an estimated 1,600 banking deserts in the US, with most of them incorporating areas with large African-American populations, only widening inequality. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/12196324.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: FT Edit team  2022 'Something for the weekend — Read FT Edit on your iPad' FT.com 17 December.
