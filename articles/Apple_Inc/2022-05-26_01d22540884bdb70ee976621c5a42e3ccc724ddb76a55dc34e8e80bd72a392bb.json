  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose 0.7% to 4,004</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 rose 243 points, or 0.7%, to 32,147</p><p>* Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 rose 0.6% to 12,013</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow industrials DJIA booked its fourth-straight session, rising 191.66 points, or 0.6%, to 32,120.28. The S&amp;P 500 index SPX gained 1% to 3,978.73, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP rose 1.5% to 11,434.74.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>Markets were set to build on Wednesday's gains that were fueled by the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. Analysts said those minutes signaled the central bank remains open to rethinking its aggressive rate-hiking plans to tame high inflation.</p><p>Still, the Fed didn't reveal much that the market didn't already know, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>\"The risks remain to the more hawkish side relative to market pricing. If the Fed is to pause the rerating process at a lower level than previously thought, inflation expectations will need to drop further. In 2018 the Fed's balance sheet was half the size it is today, and the likes of Apple were not offering 10% pay rises,\" he told clients in a note.</p><p>There was plenty of corporate news for investors to chew over, with chip group Broadcom Inc. AVGO announcing a $61 billion deal for cloud company VMware Inc. VMW, though speculation has been circulating the market for a few days. Broadcom shares fell slightly, while VMware rose 1%.</p><p>Shares of Twitter Inc. TWTR surged 5% in premarket trading after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a regulatory filing that he will lean on equity to finance his $44 billion Twitter deal, and not a margin loan backed by shares of his electric-car maker.</p><p>Among the decliners, shares of Apple Inc. AAPL fell 1.4% in premarket trade, after Bloomberg reported, citing sources, that the iPhone maker plans to keep production of its flagship item flat this year due to industry challenges.</p><p>Separately, Apple said it would lift hourly pay for U.S. workers to $22 an hour, up 45% from 2018, to compete in a tight labor market and amid pushes by some employees to unionize.</p><p>But investors were also looking at another batch of weak tech forecasts that came after Wednesday's market close. Shares of cloud computing company Nutanix Inc.NTNX tumbled 32% after its poor fourth-quarter outlook.</p><p>Nvidia Corp. NVDA shares were down 5% in premarket trading after the chip maker reported record results, but a weaker outlook due to China COVID shutdowns and the war in Ukraine. And Snowflake Inc. SNOW shares fell 14% after the software company gave a disappointing forecastand reported cautious consumer activity.</p><p>Investors were waiting for a revision to U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product and weekly jobless claims, both due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. That will be followed by pending home sales for April due at 10 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Opinion: More tech companies are seeing a spring swoon, but there may be a silver lining</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>* The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 2 basis points to 2.766%. Yields and Treasury prices move opposite each other.</p><p>* The ICE Dollar Index DXY, which measures the greenback against major currencies, was down 0.2%.</p><p>* In oil futures CL00, West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CLN22 gained 0.8% to $111.24 a barrel.
