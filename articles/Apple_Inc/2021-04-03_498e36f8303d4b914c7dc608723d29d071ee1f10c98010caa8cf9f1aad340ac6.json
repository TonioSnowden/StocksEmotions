  "text": "<p>   As a child in London, Olivia Campbell showed promise as a pianist, only to stop taking lessons before the equivalent of middle school. When the now-grown operations engineer decided to reacquaint herself with the piano late last year, she got a Lumi. </p><p>   Smart instruments like the Lumi and Jamstik's Guitar Trainer, both released last September, combine instruction via their respective apps with videogame-style exercises and scoring. The mix is sufficiently addictive that you (or your kids) might be loath to stop practicing, rather than start. </p><p>   The Lumi has only 24 keys compared with a real piano's 88. But that's enough to teach the fundamentals. To start practicing, pull up the Lumi app on a tablet or smartphone. The app will steer you through a beginner curriculum, or let you choose from among 72 beginner-to-intermediate interactive lessons and 40 free songs. (A $10/month subscription unlocks 600-plus songs by acts ranging from the Beatles to Beyonce, and nearly 400 exercises.) </p><p>   As songs and lessons play on the app, colored bars corresponding to the keys scroll toward you on your screen. As they do, the analogous keys on your keyboard light up in the same colors, cuing you to strike them. The Lumi will score your accuracy on a note-by-note basis as if you were playing Guitar Hero, the music rhythm videogame. </p><p>   Ms. Campbell dove in with the \"intermediate\"-level theme from \"Game of Thrones.\" As the notes advanced on her like an unceasing rainbow-colored throng of White Walkers, she realized she might have been \"a bit too ambitious.\" Still, she says, \"it's all about practicing making perfect.\" </p><p>   The Guitar Trainer by Jamstik similarly has only seven frets (the metal strips in the instrument's fingerboard) compared with the roughly 21 on most electric guitars. Sensors in the Jamstik's neck detect your finger placement. So when the companion app instructs you to play a G chord, the on-screen diagram changes color with each string you press correctly. You achieve more than sore fingertips as you master the play-along songs; you also earn XP, or experience points, advancing your way to shredder-dom. </p><p>   And if you've progressed beyond the Guitar Trainer and gotten yourself a full-size axe, the Spark practice amp from Positive Grid offers dozens of virtual effects and AI-powered accompaniments. Riff for a few bars, and the amp's app will generate a virtual band to play along with you. You can even import songs from Spotify or Apple Music and strum along to automatically generated chord charts. By the time the world is ready to attend concerts again, you'll be ready to fantasize that you're, at least, the opening act. </p><p></p>",
