  "title": "Florida School Mask Mandates Draw Sanctions From State Board of Education; Districts in Alachua County, home to Gainesville, and Broward County, including Fort Lauderdale, threatened with funding cuts",
  "text": "<p>\"These districts, maybe while well-intentioned, have not followed the protocols,\" said Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran during the education board meeting. \"They have to comply with the law, whether they agree with it or not.\"</p><p>The move escalated a continuing battle between the state and some local school officials over whether to require masks and comes at a time when Covid-19 cases are surging in Florida. Hundreds of students and staff have tested positive for the virus only days into the new school year, and thousands more are in quarantine because of possible exposure.</p><p>More clashes are possible in the coming days. Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the largest district in the state, is expected to consider a mask mandate at a school board meeting on Wednesday. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said he supported the recommendation of a medical task force to implement such a rule.</p><p>Hillsborough County Public Schools also is expected to weigh a mask order at a school board meeting Wednesday. As of Tuesday morning—a week after the start of classes there—more than 8,700 students and school employees were either in isolation because of a positive Covid-19 test or in quarantine due to potential exposure.</p><p>Meanwhile, state and federal lawsuits challenging Florida's order barring school mask mandates are pending.</p><p>Florida logged more than 151,000 Covid-19 cases over the past week, more than any other state and accounting for one in five cases in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>An executive order issued by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in July, along with a subsequent state rule, allowed parents to opt their children out of any school mask requirement. The school districts in Alachua and Broward counties imposed mask mandates anyway, with only limited exceptions, including authorization from a medical professional to opt out.</p><p>Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran responded by sending letters earlier this month to the districts warning that if they didn't comply with the law, he might push to withhold funds from the districts equal to the salaries of the local superintendent and school board members.</p><p>The Broward County school district replied that its mask order was aimed at mitigating the spread of Covid-19 and that giving priority to parent choice over the advice of public-health experts violates a constitutional mandate to ensure schools are safe. The Alachua County school district cited soaring Covid-19 cases in the area and noted that two school custodians had recently died of virus-related complications.</p><p>\"Our goal is to keep our schools open,\" said Carlee Simon, superintendent of Alachua County Public Schools, during the education board meeting. \"The masks are a safety device that we are using to reduce the spread of Covid and the need for quarantine.\"</p><p>Florida's ability to financially sanction superintendents and school board members is limited. \"The state does not, and has never, managed the payroll for local officials,\" said Christina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for Mr. DeSantis. \"The only way the state could tailor the financial penalties to hold accountable the few officials who made the decision to break the law would be to withhold state funding in the exact amount of those officials' salaries.\"</p><p>Last week, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona wrote a letter to Florida school superintendents saying districts could make up any money withheld by the state by tapping federal emergency relief funds.</p><p>Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com</p><p>Mask Mandates</p><p>More coverage of Covid-19 restrictions, selected by the editors</p><p>* Schools Reopen to Mask Confusion (Aug. 8)</p><p>* Florida Battles Record Covid-19 Hospitalizations, as Delta Variant Surges (Aug. 3)</p><p>* Masks Are Back On at Home Depot, McDonald's and Target (Aug. 2)</p><p>* Disney World, Apple to Mandate Masks Indoors (July 29)</p><p>Florida School Mask Mandates Draw Sanctions From State Board of Education</p>",
