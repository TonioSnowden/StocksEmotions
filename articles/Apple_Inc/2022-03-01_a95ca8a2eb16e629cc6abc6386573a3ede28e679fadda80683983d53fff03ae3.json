It has comfortable accommodations for a large brood. Or slightly less comfortable seating for its maximum of eight occupants.</p><p>It offers things like TV streaming (new this year), apps, Wi-Fi, wireless headphones, device charging, storage space, vacuum cleaner, power outlet, 10 cup holders, and a high degree of protection. All propelled by a robust V-6 engine and with the option of all-wheel drive.</p><p>Granted, some buyers will still consider a 3-row SUV, but the advantage of a minivan is that it's easier to get in and out of. And manufacturers have created their minivans with attention to the right kinds of details that appeal to parents and children alike.</p><p>The 2022 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is&#xa0;reviewed separately.</p><p>2022 Chrysler Pacifica pricing</p><p>The 2022 Chrysler Pacifica van starts at $37,095, plus a destination fee of $1,495. That's for the front-drive Touring version.</p><p>As a Touring L model, the Pacifica starts at $40,465 (FWD) or $43,460 (AWD).</p><p>In Limited trim, the 2022 Pacifica begins at $49,145 (FWD) or $51,940 (AWD).</p><p>The Pinnacle trim level starts at $53,300 with FWD and $56,095 with AWD. Most conveniences come as standard on the Pacifica at this point, so adding a few minor options won't push the price up by any substantial amount.</p><p>That said, the 2022 Chrysler Pacifica starts at a disadvantage to the more affordable&#xa0;Honda Odyssey&#xa0;(from just over $32K), the hybrid-only&#xa0;Toyota Sienna&#xa0;(about $35K), and the new-for-2022&#xa0;Kia KR:000270 Carnival&#xa0;(also just over $32K). Honda HMC and Toyota TM both enjoy stronger resale values than the Pacifica, and we wouldn't be surprised if the intriguing Carnival worked out that way as well. The Sienna is the one rival to offer all-wheel drive.</p><p>Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area paid for their new Pacifica minivan.</p><p>ChryslerDriving the 2022 Chrysler Pacifica</p><p>When the kids are doing all they can to drive the grown-ups crazy, the 2022 Pacifica is doing a lot to create tranquility. It's easy to drive, with good outward vision and the raised driving position so many people love.</p><p>Higher trims also make parking easier, offering distance sensors at both ends and a 360-degree camera system, as well as a self-parking feature for parallel and perpendicular spaces. But many safety features come in right at the lowest level, which is commendable.</p><p>The engine is strong enough for most situations a minivan is going to find itself in, and the Pacifica has a tow rating of 3,600 pounds. That's excellent for the class. An all-wheel drive system is available, giving big families in wintry regions a greater range of choice beyond SUV/crossovers.</p><p>You might like:How to use telematics to monitor your teen's driving</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>One new addition for the 2022 Pacifica is a cabin air filter that captures 95% of particulates. That means bacteria, pollen, and other allergens. It's another line of defense from the big, bad outside world.</p><p>In standard form, the Chrysler Pacifica seats eight (seven with all-wheel drive), with plenty of space for average-sized adults in the third row. Pinnacle trim has a couple of captain's chairs in the second row, bringing the occupant count down to seven. We like the low step-in height and the standard-issue powered sliding side doors for easy access.</p><p>The seats are comfortable and a FamCam interior camera is available to keep an eye on those in the back. If that's too expensive, the standard model still comes with a convex “conversation mirror” in addition to the usual rearview mirror.</p><p>Behind the third seating row is a commodious 32.3 cubic feet of luggage area, expanding to a maximum of 140.5 cubic feet when the second and third rows are out of the picture. However, that's still not quite as spacious as the Honda Odyssey.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>Vehicles like the 2022 Pacifica are called minivans for a reason. Their job isn't to enhance whatever charisma the driver may have. They must provide roomy accommodation and luggage space for up to eight occupants. If that means not being the sleekest-looking ride on the block, then let the Cheerios fall as they may.</p><p>The Pinnacle trim has 20-inch alloy wheels, which are available as options in the lower trims, but they may affect ride quality. So give them a quick test drive before making a decision.</p><p>Also see:The 25 bestselling SUVs</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Stow 'n' goInstead of removing heavy and cumbersome seats from the second and third rows for those times when cargo capacity needs increasing, this ingenious system lets owners fold those seats and stow them in the floor. Keep the seats in place and there's some useful storage space under the second row.</p><p>Uconnect theater family groupStandard in the Pinnacle model and optional elsewhere for around $3,000, this rear-seat entertainment system adds, among other things, a Blu-ray player, interior cabin camera, Wi-Fi, hands-free operation of the sliding side doors and tailgate, vacuum, heated second-row seats, household-style 115-volt outlet, and — new for 2022 — Amazon Fire TV for Auto with apps. Those up front can watch Amazon Fire TV on the infotainment display when the vehicle is in Park.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>Powered sliding side doors and a powered tailgate are standard in the basic Touring trim. This version of the 2022 Pacifica also comes with keyless entry/ignition, remote start, tri-zone automatic climate control, 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat, active noise cancellation (sorry, it doesn't work on humans), folding/stowable seats in the second and third rows, and a self-dimming mirror with a remote garage door opener.</p><p>When transporting our precious pumpkins, safety is paramount.&#xa0;Chrysler&#xa0;equips the Pacifica with forward collision warning, blind-spot monitoring, rear parking sensors, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, rain-sensing wipers, hill-start assist, and automatic high beams. Plus a bunch of airbags.</p><p>When it's time to play “The Wheels On The Bus” through the stereo, it's handled by a generously sized 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen with a 6-speaker audio setup. This system also has wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, Amazon Alexa compatibility, two USB ports, Bluetooth, and satellite radio.</p><p>Check out: Which electric SUVs have the most cargo space? Here's a full list</p><p>Factory options</p><p>We would still be inclined to spend another $3,000 or so on the Touring L trim, despite the fine array of standard equipment in the base 2022 Pacifica. That would bring perforated leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, heated/leather-wrapped steering wheel, sunshades for the back two rows, a nicer center console with illuminated cup holders, and a self-parking function.</p><p>It's a bigger financial jump to the all-wheel-drive Limited version, which also has a 3-pane panoramic sunroof, hands-free sliding side door and tailgate operation, Nappa leather seating surfaces, 8-way power-adjustable front passenger seat, heated/ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, wireless charging, navigation, wireless smartphone integration, and a vacuum cleaner.</p><p>At the pinnacle of the 2022 Pacifica range is the, um, Pinnacle trim. Some of the equipment is more like that of a luxury car, such as quilted Nappa leather upholstery, lumbar pillows for the second row, interior cabin camera (with a split-view display and a “zoom to seat” feature), rear seat entertainment system, and a 19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.</p><p>The Touring model doesn't qualify for the full rear-seat entertainment system package with Amazon Fire TV. But Touring and Touring L trims are eligible for all-wheel drive, larger alloy wheels, running boards, and a dual-pane sunroof. The Pacifica offers up to 12 USB ports, including USB-C. Limited trim can also be ordered with much of the Pinnacle's standard equipment.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch:‘This is a unique opportunity for families to get more money in their pockets': As child-care costs soar, one tax credit may be a winner for parents this year</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>This non-hybrid variant of the 2022 Pacifica has a 3.6-liter V6 engine developing 287 horsepower on regular gasoline. That's enough muscle to get a minivan full of people and their things up hills and along freeways with relative ease.</p><p>It connects to a 9-speed automatic transmission, which contributes to decent fuel economy: 28 mpg on the highway, matching the Honda Odyssey. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is the standard setup. All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional in the lower two trims, standard in the top two.</p><p>The engine has a stop/restart function that saves a bit of fuel while idling. If drivers find themselves being irritated by the restart action, it can be turned off.</p><p>3.6-liter V6287 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm262 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/28 mpg (FWD), 17/25 mpg (AWD)</p><p>This story originally ran on&#xa0;KBB.com.&#xa0;</p>",
