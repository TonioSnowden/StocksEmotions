  "text": "<p>   For example, Meta recently said that it could charge content creators in its metaverse up to 47.5% of the sale price of virtual goods sold through its new sales platform, which it introduced in April. </p><p>   Mr. Bosworth took pains to distinguish between what the company charges for apps sold in its VR app store, where it takes a 30% cut, and what it charges for sales within its metaverse, which can be accessed through apps purchased from its VR store or elsewhere. </p><p>   So, for example, if someone accessed Meta's metaverse through a web browser or a mobile device instead of a Meta-built VR headset -- the ability to do so is forthcoming -- then something sold in its metaverse would only be subject to an in-metaverse 25% sales fee. </p><p>   Even if Apple wins the war for headset dominance, Meta still has ample opportunity to make money from its metaverse. Just as the iPhone supercharged Meta's growth back when it was called Facebook, a stylish and user-friendly VR or AR headset from Apple could prove to be the perfect delivery device for a metaverse-based social network brought to you by -- who else, really? -- Meta. </p><p></p>",
