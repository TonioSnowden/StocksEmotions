  "title": "Taylor Swift's ‘Red' re-recording is dropping a week early, on Nov. 12",
  "text": "<p>Eleven-time Grammy winner Taylor Swift has been re-recording her early records ever since music manager Scooter Braun bought her former label, Big Machine, and took control of the master recordings to her first six, multi-platinum albums. But the “Begin Again” singer dropped some good news for fans on Thursday: her new version of 2012's “Red,” now dubbed “Red (Taylor's Version),” is debuting a week earlier than expected in November.&#xa0;</p><p>“Got some news that I think you're gonna like,” Swift tweeted. “My version of ‘Red' will be out a week earlier than scheduled (including the 4 disc vinyl) on November 12th ! Can't wait to celebrate the 13th with you and our new/old autumn heartbreak album.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1443619878062235650?s=20Swift's announcement quickly sent the hashtag #RedTaylorsVersion toward the top of Twitter's trending topics on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>https://twitter.com/taylornation13/status/1443621925020909574?s=20https://twitter.com/GetawayCaroline/status/1443620604725313542?s=20https://twitter.com/alexandergold/status/1443625167683395603?s=20The album is available for preorder on CD ($15), vinyl ($50) and as a digital album ($15). Streaming services like Spotify SPOT and Apple AAPL Music are also letting listeners bookmark the album early as a pre-save and a pre-add, respectively. Swift hasn't released the track list yet — well, besides a video of scrambled letters for fans to decipher in the meantime. But Swift's online store says the album contains 30 songs, including nine tracks from “the vault,” several new tracks, as well as one song that is 10 minutes long. It will also contain an album booklet with never-before-seen photos, artwork and lyrics for the nine songs from the value.&#xa0;</p><p>Read more: Here's why Taylor Swift is re-recording her first 6 albums</p><p>The original “Red” album contains Swift's first career Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” and the album peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2012, and remained on the chart for 171 weeks. The record also features Swift favorites such as “I Knew You Were Trouble,” “22” and “Everything Has Changed” with Ed Sheeran.&#xa0;</p><p>Swift has decided to re-record her first six albums after Braun announced that his Ithaca Holdings company had acquired Big Machine Label Group for more than $300 million, which included Swift's six albums. He then sold her catalog without the singer-songwriter being given a chance to acquire her masters.</p><p>From the archives:What everyone can learn from the $300 million deal that Taylor Swift claims ‘stripped me of my life's work'</p><p>The remade “Red” will be her second re-recorded album, after “Fearless (Taylor's Version) came out in April. The remake of the 2008 album also hit the top spot on the Billboard 200. &#xa0;</p>",
