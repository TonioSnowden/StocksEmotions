  "text": "<p>New York-based hedge fund Engine Capital LP wants the retailer to examine the two alternatives to improve its lagging stock price, according to a letter sent to Kohl's KSS board Sunday and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Engine owns a roughly 1% Kohl's stake.</p><p>Engine argues that the company has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and other retailers in recent years. Kohl's shares closed Friday at $48.45, roughly where they were 10 years ago, giving the Menomonee Falls, Wis., company a market value of around $7 billion.</p><p>Engine said in the letter that assuming online sales revenue of around $6.2 billion, Kohl's digital business alone would be worth $12.4 billion. Engine also said it believes there are private-equity firms that would pay at least $75 a share and that interactions with potential buyers suggest they could do so by monetizing Kohl's real estate.</p><p>Kohl's didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Apple's iPhone successor comes into focus.</p><p>China seeks first military base on Africa's Atlantic coast, U.S. intelligence finds.</p>",
