  "title": "Facebook Feeds Off Digital Ads --- Profit doubles, but shares fall on expected slowdown in revenue growth",
  "text": "<p>Facebook's profit doubled from a year earlier to $10.39 billion, or $3.61 a share, soundly beating analysts' expectations. Revenue rose 56% to $29.08 billion.</p><p>However, shares fell 3.6% in after-hours trading as the company said it expects revenue growth to slow in the second half of this year. The company's stock has gained about 22% over the past three months through Wednesday's market close, compared with roughly 5% the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>Facebook has previously warned that the impact of Apple Inc.'s privacy changes in its iOS operating system could crimp the company's ad-targeting capabilities. Wednesday, the company said the changes could have a more significant impact in the current quarter than the previous one, as more people update their iPhones and iPads.</p><p>While Facebook reported 3.5 billion monthly users across its platforms in the latest quarter, the company still sees itself in a growth mode and wants to expand revenue streams beyond its core advertising business.</p><p>On an earnings call with analysts, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the second quarter was good \"for our product and business\" but before devoting the rest of his opening remarks to plans to invest more in content creators, improve commerce features and build a metaverse -- a social, digital environment unlike any that currently exists.</p><p>\"This is one of the most exciting projects that we're going to get to work on in our lifetime,\" he said.</p><p>Earlier this month, Facebook pledged to pay more than $1 billion to content creators on its social networks through 2022, joining its social-media peers who have made big-dollar commitments over the past year to invest directly in people responsible for boosting engagement among users. The move reflects a bet that monetary rewards will serve as a sweetener for those deciding which platforms to focus their energy on.</p><p>\"It's clear that they're playing the long game,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik. \"The advertising story, there is only so much they can influence and affect. I'm optimistic about what they're spending on the next branches of growth.\"</p><p>The results come as Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Tuesday reported its best quarter ever for sales and profit, bolstered by a strong digital advertising market. Last week, Snap Inc. said its revenue more than doubled in the second quarter and user growth jumped the most in four years, while Twitter Inc. said sales rose 74% and that it swung to a profit from a year earlier.</p><p>The company's business practices and its platforms continue to face a drumbeat of scrutiny from the White House, nonprofit groups and other parties.</p><p>The Real Facebook Oversight Board, part of a U.K. nonprofit called The Citizens, chided the company Wednesday over disinformation on its main platform. Outside Facebook's Washington, D.C., office, the group staged a protest in which participants stood beside blue body bags with the company's logo and the words \"DISINFO KILLS\" printed on them, according to a spokesman.</p>",
