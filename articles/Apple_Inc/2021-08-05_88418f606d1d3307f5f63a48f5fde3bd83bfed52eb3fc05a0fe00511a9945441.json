  "title": "Business News:  Vici Buys Portfolio  Of MGM Casinos  ---  Deal values real-estate  owner -- spun off from  the resorts operator in  2016 -- at $17.2 billion  ----  By Dave Sebastian",
  "text": "<p>   Real-estate investment trust Vici Properties Inc. agreed to buy MGM Growth Properties LLC in a deal that values the casino real-estate owner at $17.2 billion, including about $5.7 billion in debt. </p><p>   Under the agreement, casino operator MGM Resorts International will receive about $4.4 billion in cash. MGM Resorts spun off MGM Growth Properties in 2016 and still controls the REIT, whose portfolio on the Las Vegas Strip includes Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur and MGM Grand Las Vegas. </p><p>   In recent years, MGM Resorts has sold some of its real-estate holdings, using the proceeds to focus on new business areas including sports betting, entertainment and a casino development in Japan. </p><p>   MGM Resorts said it would keep a roughly 1% stake in the Vici operating partnership, worth about $370 million. </p><p>   The deal entails MGM Growth Properties investors swapping each Class A share for $43 in newly issued Vici stock, a 16% premium over MGM Growth Properties' closing price Tuesday. </p><p>   Shares of MGM Growth Properties rose 6.8% to $39.61 Wednesday. MGM Resorts shares rose 0.9% to $37.27.  Vici shares fell 0.3% to $30.18. </p><p>   The deal comes as the summer rebound in travel has lifted leisure and hospitality companies from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, even as they track developments with the spread of the more-contagious Delta strain and other coronavirus variants. </p><p>   Vici said the MGM Growth Properties deal would add to its portfolio 15 entertainment resort properties across nine regions, including 3,000 hotel rooms, 3.6 million square feet of meeting and convention space, and hundreds of food, beverage and entertainment venues. </p><p>   Vici sees the deal as a bet on Las Vegas as an experiential destination that has an edge over other U.S. vacation spots like Orlando, Fla., said  Edward Pitoniak, chief executive officer. </p><p>   \"As much as parents like to spend money on their kids whether in Orlando and other locations, I don't think anybody's ever spent $10,000 on a bottle of apple juice,\" Mr. Pitoniak said on a conference call. \"Las Vegas is a place where people do $10,000 on a bottle of vodka or whatever else they may be buying.\" </p><p>   In March, Vici said it had agreed to buy all the land and real-estate assets associated with the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center for $4 billion in cash from Las Vegas Sands Corp. </p><p>   MGM Resorts last month said it agreed to take full ownership of the huge CityCenter property on the Las Vegas Strip in a complex arrangement to sell real estate but still gain all the revenue from operating the massive Strip casino. The deal valued City-Center at $5.8 billion, including $1.5 billion in debt, the company said. </p><p>   About 55% of Vici's rent base will be generated by regional properties, while the rest will come from properties on the Strip after the deal closes, the company said. </p><p>   After the deal closes, which the companies expect by mid-2022, Vici said it would enter into an amended lease agreement with MGM Resorts. The lease would have an initial total rent of $860 million a year, including MGM Growth Properties' pending acquisition of MGM Springfield, and an initial term of 25 years, with three 10-year tenant renewal options. </p><p></p>",
