  "text": "<p>When I wrote about upscale amateur <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7466008d-0dd1-4206-856c-2f77096fa2b1\">astronomy</a> in <em>How To Spend It</em> 15 years ago&#xa0;it was a hobby that, if&#xa0;done wholeheartedly, required an investment of tens to hundreds of thousands of pounds, an intimidating level of learning, and a willingness to do all-nighters outside. Also, crucially, it was&#xa0;hopeless to even try in light-polluted cities&#xa0;and suburbs.&#xa0;</p> <p>But this powerful new reflector telescope from a Marseille company changes all that and makes serious astronomy brilliantly simple. Apart from the 114mm-diameter mirror reflector that does the magnifying, it is wholly electronic and you don't even peer directly into it; a phone or tablet serves in place of an eyepiece.</p> <p>Superb, sharp, colourful live images from light years away appearing, in my case, on an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/362695f4-40d8-4e97-91ee-c77700cf62fc\">11in iPad Pro</a>'s eye-crossingly sharp screen, is a revelation. You can easily see galaxies and nebulae invisible to a lot of conventional telescopes. And it goes without saying that you can save and share&#xa0;everything you view – or have as many as nine other people viewing live on&#xa0;their own&#xa0;tablets and phones.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://unistellaroptics.com/equinox-en-uk/\">Unistellar's eVscope eQuinox</a> has three other, well, stellar features. Firstly, the software will compensate for light pollution from human sources, or from the&#xa0;Moon, which, when big and boisterous, can mess with the view from more distant objects. This is a huge plus. Secondly, from&#xa0;<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unistellar/id1435141427\">the accompanying app</a>, you can point&#xa0;the motorised telescope at any one of&#xa0;5,400 pre-programmed celestial bodies. Just touch where you want to go, and it obligingly whirs into the exact position, as&#xa0;well as giving you information on what&#xa0;you are observing. Such automated telescopes have been around for a decade, but the app for this one is in&#xa0;a different league.&#xa0;</p> <p>Both these features lead to the&#xa0;killer for&#xa0;me: you can do your stargazing from indoors for sessions of up to 12 hours per&#xa0;charge. Set the&#xa0;eQuinox up on a balcony, rooftop or in a garden and it will&#xa0;transmit all&#xa0;it sees wirelessly to you from up&#xa0;to 10m away.</p> <p>If you've seen the whole of Netflix these past 18 months, what&#xa0;better show to watch in&#xa0;bed&#xa0;than one that's been on since the&#xa0;Big Bang?&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Unistellar eVscope eQuinox, €2,799 plus&#xa0;€59 shipping, </em><a href=\"https://unistellaroptics.com/\"><em>unistellaroptics.com</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheFutureCritic?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@thefuturecritic</em></a></p><p>Source: Jonathan Margolis 2021 'A new telescope to put stars in your iPhone' FT.com 7 August.
