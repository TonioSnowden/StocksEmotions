  "text": "<p>Next week, <a href=\"https://www.onehundredshoreditch.com/\">One Hundred Shoreditch</a> opens on&#xa0;the site of what was once London's Ace Hotel. It's hard to know what scenesters will&#xa0;make of this restaurant and hotel complex&#xa0;from Lore Group – but I think it's pretty safe to say that they'll be impressed by its bar. <a href=\"https://www.onehundredshoreditch.com/eat-drink/seed-library/\">Seed Library</a> is the work of Mr&#xa0;Lyan, the&#xa0;multi-award-winning British bartender also known as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d5ded0c-0452-41a1-8bf4-b2660e69e037\">Ryan Chetiyawardana</a>.</p> <p>For more than a decade, 37-year-old Chetiyawardana has been a leading light of the world's cocktail scene, creating bars that delight, amuse and provoke in equal measure. From the avant-garde White Lyan in Hoxton – a&#xa0;forerunner of the zero-waste movement that eschewed all perishables, including ice – to the high glamour of Dandelyan at the Thameside Mondrian Hotel, he's married intellectual ideas and delicious drinks with an unwavering sense of fun. It's made this polymath a darling&#xa0;of the creative world – collaborators have included the Wu-Tang Clan, Tate Modern, Kelly Wearstler and Gareth Pugh; Björk and Beyoncé are among his fans. If you happen to be going to <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/\">SXSW</a> next month, you'll find him speaking there.</p> <p>These days, <a href=\"https://lyaness.com/\">Mr Lyan</a> is an international brand, with bars in Washington DC and Amsterdam. Now&#xa0;the Seed Library sees him return to his bartending roots in east London. And there is a desire with this loungey basement bar, says Chetiyawardana, to evoke something of the comfort of home. “We wanted to make it feel like a sanctuary, a retreat,” he says, “like those villains' lairs in old Bond films that are meant to be imposing but are also kind of cosy!” The palette is loosely 1970s – warm tones of putty, stone and toffee punctuated by pops of burnt orange and vibrant red. Mushroom-shaped resin table lamps emit soothing pools of light; low-slung chairs and leatherette banquettes invite you to sprawl.</p> <p>Instead of offering a lengthy concept menu that&#xa0;changes twice a year ­– the way Mr Lyan bars&#xa0;have tended to in the past – Seed Library serves just nine classics-with-a-twist and changes them almost weekly (prices around £9 to £12). There's a Sansho Leaf Martini as lush as a rain-drenched garden; a Thai Basil Vodka Lime Soda with a subtle hint of anise; a twist on a Penicillin (a sour based on peaty Scotch) made with smoky mezcal and fiery galangal; and an Apple Bellini sweetened with apple purée and scented with raspberry leaf.</p> <p>Chetiyawardana was a trailblazer for&#xa0;non-alc mixology&#xa0;– and many of these&#xa0;cocktails&#xa0;have alcohol-free iterations too.&#xa0;The Coriander Seed “Gimlet” is extraordinarily good.</p> <p>I'm struck by how many vodka classics&#xa0;there are on the menu – there's even a riff on a fruity French Martini made&#xa0;with black elderflower. Will 2022 be&#xa0;the year the much-maligned neutral spirit makes a comeback? “Too often vodka is just used&#xa0;as&#xa0;a fortifier, because people want&#xa0;to get lit,” says Chetiyawardana. “But&#xa0;the best vodkas have real texture and&#xa0;flavour to them.&#xa0;When you use a really good vodka, you&#xa0;don't need to&#xa0;be ironic about it.” He&#xa0;tends to use rye&#xa0;and&#xa0;potato vodkas&#xa0;– Belvedere Heritage (rye) and&#xa0;Luksusowa (potato) are two of&#xa0;his&#xa0;favourites.</p> <p>Tucked away in a corner of Seed Library is one of the loveliest details: a wood-panelled, vinyl-lined DJ booth modelled on a Tokyo listening bar. The plan is for it to play host to regular guest DJs; the house playlist revolves around 1960s and '70s rock and soul, Afrobeat and Ethiopian jazz. “Vinyl is definitely encouraged here – with all its pops and crackles,” says Chetiyawardana. “This bar is about a return to a more analogue way&#xa0;of doing things.” </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelascelles/\"><em>@alicelascelles</em></a></p><p>Source: Alice Lascelles 2022 'Inside Seed Library, a Bond villain's lair of a bar' FT.com 22 February.
