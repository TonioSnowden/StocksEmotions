  "text": "<p>Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. posted its slowest revenue growthsince going public a decade ago, as the company navigates growing competition for users and privacy headwinds on its advertising business.</p><p>Meta's advertising revenue for the first quarter was $27.9 billion, up 6.6% compared with a year prior. Analysts had predicted Meta's advertising revenue would rise to $28.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022.</p><p>The revenue growth marked the lowest rate since the company went public in 2012, signaling the impact that ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple Inc. last year have had on its advertising business. The company had warned that those changes would cost Meta some $10 billion in 2022.</p><p>Meta reported net income of $7.5 billion, compared to analysts' expectations of $7.1 billion.</p><p>The results were better than many investors expected. Meta's share price climbed sharply in after-hours trading, up more than 12% shortly after results were announced.</p><p>Facebook's user base grew to 1.96 billion daily active users, up from 1.93 billion reported in February. Analysts expected Meta to report an uptick in Facebook's daily users to 1.95 billion. In the prior quarter, Facebook's daily active user base fell by two million users, which was the first time the company had reported a decline in users.</p><p>Meta also forecast that it is expecting revenue between $28 billion and $30 billion for the second quarter, shy of the $30.7 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet.</p><p>Meta's stock price was battered in February when it posted quarterly results that showed a sharper-than-expected decline in profits, a gloomy revenue outlook and a dip in its daily active users.</p><p>Since that report, Meta shares have fallen nearly 44% and the company has lost nearly $388 billion in market cap.</p><p>Meta's earnings show continued turbulence for the digital-ad business. Social-media rival Snap Inc. posted its first-quarter results last week, showing that its business is continuing to feel the sting from Apple's privacy changes. Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Tuesday also posted slower sales growth as global economic turmoil disrupted digital-ad spending.</p><p>One highlight for Meta was its Reality Labs unit, which is central to its long-term bet on VR headsets, AR glasses and virtual worlds, known as the metaverse, in which users can live and work.</p><p>The unit's revenue came in at $695 million, ahead of the $683 million analysts were expecting.</p><p>The company has warned that building the metaverse would take many billions of dollars in investments and several years of work.</p><p>Facebook's daily user base in the U.S. and Canada grew to 196 million, up from 195 million at the end of the previous quarter. In Europe, Facebook's daily active users fell from 309 million at the end of the previous quarter to 307 million.</p><p>Write to Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com</p><p>Facebook Parent Meta Posts Slowest Revenue Growth Since IPO</p>",
