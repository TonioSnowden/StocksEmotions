  "title": "Can't Sleep? Seven Devices That Might Solve Your 'Coronosomnia' for Good; We tested a lulling light display, a wearable sleep lab and a robot that trains you to breathe your way to slumber.",
  "text": "<p>For those looking to get things back on track, several companies are offering products that promise to get you to sleep faster, stay asleep more consistently and wake up easier, improving overall sleep health. Seattle area surgery scheduler Genny Coleman, 46, who's struggled with insomnia since contracting Covid-19 last summer, recently tried one such product on the urging of a friend with a newborn: the Hatch Restore. Released in May 2020, it doubles as a white-noise machine to help you sleep and a sunrise alarm clock to wake you up with gentle light and sound. \"There are still some nights [I] may not sleep perfectly, but the Hatch definitely helps [me] to get better rest,\" said Ms. Coleman. Other new sleep solutions range from wearable patches to breathable robots. We tested the following seven.</p><p>1. Casper Glow Light</p><p>Claim to Fame: This rechargeable LED light is designed to help you create a nightly routine. Once you've used the app to dial in some settings, it's easy to use. When you're ready for bed, flip the light over to turn it on. Depending on the \"dimming time\" you've selected, the light will slowly fade over a period between 15 and 90 minutes. The beacon serves as a helpful nudge, reminding you it's time to put away your phone (and its sleep-compromising blue light) and wind down.</p><p>Test Results: This became a staple on my nightstand. I crawled into bed and read until the decrescendo alerted me it was time to close my eyes. This might not help much if you have serious insomnia, but for the mildly sleep-challenged, it's enough.</p><p>Best For: Page-turners who stay up late and regret it in the morning. $129, Casper.com</p><p>2. OneClock Analog Waking Clock</p><p>Claim to Fame: Using your phone as an alarm clock is a bad ideaâ€”picking it up before bed is certain to induce scrolling. This minimalist clock, introduced in 2021, will gently nudge you awake in the morning. Waking songs currently include exclusive compositions by Jon Natchez from rock band the War on Drugs. The company bets that you'll appreciate waking up to these atmospheric, invigorating pieces more than some of the cacophonies your iPhone spews.</p><p>Test Results: The modern equivalent of waking up to soft AM radio: comforting, calming, familiar. It was nice to start my day with music without needing to grab my phone to find the right Spotify playlist. A fair warning: The device's many buttons lack labels. That makes setup tricky, but ultimately, learnable. Just don't skip the online FAQ.</p><p>Best For: Melophiles ready to break up with bedtime blue light for good. $299, OneClock.co</p><p>3. Somnox 2 Sleep Robot</p><p>Claim to Fame: Dutch inventor Julian Jagtenberg began creating the Sleep Robot in 2015 with a team of other sleep-deprived engineers to help his mother overcome insomnia without medication. As you hold the 3-pound rechargeable jelly bean to your chest, like a teddy bear, its soft in-and-out movement and sounds are designed to encourage deeper breathing.</p><p>Test Results: Cuddling a robot is weird, yet effective. It reminded me of holding a delicate baby, but more relaxing. Downloading its app enables nearly two dozen sounds (or you can stream your own audio through Bluetooth) and lets you set your own breathing program. When you're awake, Somnox also works as the best stress ball ever: Just hold it in your lap at your desk. One downside: Given the price, it was disappointing that the washable cover pilled quickly.</p><p>Best For:Anxious adults who wish their bed was still covered in a menagerie of stuffed animals. $599, Somnox.com</p><p>4. Wesper Sleep Kit</p><p>Claim to Fame: This system turns your bedroom into a sleep lab, providing granular data you can't get from most wearables. After snoozing for at least three nights with its crescent-shaped patches stuck to your chest and stomach, you schedule an initial video consultation with a sleep specialist on the app. He or she analyzes your results to pinpoint problems like sleep apnea.</p><p>Test Results: While my report didn't find any issues, it helped me tweak my schedule to complete full sleep cycles. Impressive results, given I'd never heard of \"sleep cycles\" before trying the Wesper.</p><p>Best For: Anyone with serious sleep challenges or biohackers. $199 plus $10/month after first month, Wesper.co</p><p>5. Dodow Sleep Aid</p><p>Claim to Fame: Measuring a little over 3 inches in diameter, this flat, white puck uses a pulsating light to coach your breathing at night. Tap the top as you climb into bed, and the battery-operated device projects a blue circle onto your ceiling. You inhale when it expands and exhale when it retracts, a breathing technique that relies on a mind-body therapy called cardiac coherence to control heart rate variability and help you fall asleep faster.</p><p>Test Results: Promising, but many will find the Dodow a bit awkward to use. It's difficult to see the blue light unless your room is pitch black. And since the light appears on the ceiling, it's hard to see unless you sleep on your back. You trigger the device through a series of taps, but I had to reread the instructions a few times and practice just to get the right \"touch.\" That said, watching a pulsing light is so boring that it's bound to make you drift off eventually.</p><p>Best For: Back sleepers who've tried everything else, $60, mydodow.com</p><p>6. Loftie Clock</p><p>Claim to Fame: Loftie believes its three-in-one digital alarm clock, white noise machine and nightlight will finally convince you to stop sleeping with your phone on your nightstand. You can use buttons on the Loftie to set alarms and launch breathwork, meditation and sound-bath sessions without pulling out your phone and saturating your eyes with blue light. Alarms are two-phased: a soft \"wake-up\" chime plays for 30 seconds until a slightly faster (and louder) \"get-up\" tune signals that, well, it's time to get up.</p><p>Test Results: We were impressed with the sheer volume of content stuffed inside this small device. Its bedtime stories are oddly soothing, like the grown-up version of having parents tuck you in at night. We also liked the clock's \"Bed Signal,\" which cues a lullaby and a nightlight at the same time every night.</p><p>Best For: Perpetual snooze-button hitters who need a schedule. $149, ByLoftie.com</p><p>7. Flare Audio Sleep Pro</p><p>Claim to Fame: These sleek plugs have memory-foam ball tips (each set comes with two sizes), connected by a titanium stem, that are designed to mold to your ear canal. They're intended to reduce all variety of sleep-precluding noises, from sirens to snoring, by an average of 32 decibels.</p><p>Test Results: At this price, the earbuds disappointed. They look great, but I found that the design was hard to wear for a whole night, especially when I slept on my side, since they stick out. They do a great job canceling noise, but you might get similar performance in a more comfortable package from the sort of standard buds you could buy at a hardware store.</p><p>Best For: Back sleepers and frequent fliers. $40, FlareAudio.com</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
