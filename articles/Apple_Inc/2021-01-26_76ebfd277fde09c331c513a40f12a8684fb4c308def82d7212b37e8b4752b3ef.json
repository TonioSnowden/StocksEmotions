  "text": "<p>US stocks lost steam on Tuesday as investors tracked corporate earnings season and banked on the Federal Reserve reaffirming its loose monetary policy stance at its meeting this week. </p> <p>In the US, the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index slipped 0.15 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite closed lower by 0.07 per cent, pausing a rally that had pushed the technology-focused index to a record high in the previous session.</p> <p>Gains were stronger in Europe, where the region-wide Stoxx 600 index closed up 0.6 per cent. Germany's Xetra Dax rose 1.7 per cent and the UK's FTSE 100 edged up 0.2 per cent. </p> <p>This came after Swiss bank UBS pledged to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/828fdead-34e3-4cf4-8ab5-91916f7e0cc5\">return billions</a> of dollars more to shareholders as surging income for the world's super-wealthy led to a sharp rise in 2020 profits, despite the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>Linde, the industrial gas producer, also increased its quarterly dividend and announced a share buyback. </p> <p>In the US, 85 per cent of companies that have released quarterly results so far have beaten Wall Street forecasts, with an average earnings-per-share outperformance of 19 per cent, according to data compiled by FactSet. Companies listed on Europe's Stoxx 600 have topped estimates by 20 per cent. </p> <p>The electric vehicle maker Tesla and the social media group Facebook are due to report earnings on Wednesday, along with Apple, the largest US company by market value. The iPhone maker is expected to report a record <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3920a716-2f55-484c-9741-75f9798918cf\">$100bn in revenues</a> for the final three months of last year. </p> <p>But earnings season was “a good time for investors to take some profits”, said Yuko Takano, global equities portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, in case companies' outlook statements do not support tech groups' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76944443-b4e6-42ac-a863-06234ac24db1\">high market valuations</a>. </p> <p>Investors were also looking ahead to a press conference on Wednesday by Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, where he is expected to assuage fears of an early exit from the US central bank's $120bn-a-month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74b6530e-9d69-43f0-a5d7-3cb363ed5398\">bond-buying programme</a> that has kept borrowing costs ultra-low and driven the stock market rally. </p> <p>Mr Powell has countered suggestions from some in the market that the Fed will soon take a more hawkish stance. Many investors expect higher US growth and inflation to be spurred by a huge stimulus package that President Joe Biden is urging lawmakers to approve. </p> <p>However, Mr Biden's plan has run into opposition from some Democrats and Republicans who are concerned about the $1.9tn price tag. The president signalled on Monday he was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e4b2cb7-b3bb-4c79-a9af-83b9085ea7af\">open to compromise</a> on some elements. </p> <p>“I doubt we will hear anything new” from Mr Powell, said Ben Laidler, chief executive of investment strategy group Tower Hudson Research. “If anything, it will be more reassurance that he is not about to take the punchbowl away.” </p> <p>The yield on the 10-year US government bond, which crossed 1 per cent for the first time since March earlier this month, was steady at 1.04 per cent. The dollar, as measured against a basket of currencies, fell 0.3 per cent. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, was 0.07 per cent lower at $55.84 a barrel. </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Colby Smith in New York 2021 'Wall Street rally hits pause after European stocks edge higher ' FT.com 26 January.
