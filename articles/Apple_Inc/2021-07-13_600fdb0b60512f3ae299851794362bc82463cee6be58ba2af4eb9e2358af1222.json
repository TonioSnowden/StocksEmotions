  "text": "<p>The dollar had its strongest day in almost a month while shares of big tech companies rose on Tuesday, after a stronger than expected jump in US consumer prices rippled through currency and equity markets. </p> <p>Despite Wall Street's blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index slipping 0.4 per cent, the technology sector of the index bucked the trend, rising 0.4 per cent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index also gave up early gains, falling to a 0.4 per cent loss.</p> <p>While the broad indices slipped —&#xa0;with 85 per cent of the companies within the S&amp;P 500 finishing the day lower — shares of big tech groups including Apple and Microsoft advanced. </p> <p>The slide in the two closely followed indices coincided with a lacklustre Treasury auction, as the US sold $24bn worth of 30-year bonds. The sale garnered the lowest demand, as measured by the bid-to-cover ratio, since February. </p> <p>Yields on the benchmark 10-year note snapped higher after the auction, ending the day up 0.04 percentage points at 1.41 per cent. </p> <p>The dollar index, which measures the greenback against leading currencies, gained 0.6 per cent, after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said June's consumer prices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/234a9b90-e4f6-4b59-9e39-c6e34ac78276\">rose</a> 5.4 per cent from a year ago, the fastest increase since August 2008 and above economists' expectations of a 4.9 per cent rise. </p> <p>The greenback has been on an upward trajectory since mid-June when Federal Reserve officials <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0bf83e29-5ee2-415e-9e03-0edb38218bf3\">brought forward</a> their expectations for the first post-pandemic rate rise by a year to 2023. The euro dropped 0.7 per cent to $1.1779 per dollar while sterling slid 0.5 per cent to $1.3814.</p> <p>“This market isn't really focused on inflation data any more,” said Juliette Cohen, strategist at CPR Asset Management, after bond yields climbed rapidly in the first few months of this year. </p> <p>“It seems more focused on the idea that economic growth is peaking,” she added, citing the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus and a possible slowdown in China as reasons for investors holding haven assets such as the easily traded 10-year Treasury.</p> <p>Gold, another haven asset, initially climbed in the US morning following the inflation data. It ended the day 0.1 per cent higher at $1,808 per troy ounce, with it having risen more than 2 per cent this month. </p> <p>Economists polled by Bloomberg expect US gross domestic product to grow at an annualised rate of more than 9 per cent in the second quarter of the year. But minutes of the Fed's latest meeting also showed some officials felt risks to the US recovery remained “elevated”. </p> <p>“It is still too early to tell if high inflation readings will be persistent,” said Tatjana Greil Castro, co-head of public markets at credit investor Muzinich &amp; Co, pointing out that data were still skewed by key economies having abruptly shut down because of coronavirus last year. </p> <p>A rise in prices of used vehicles made up<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\"> more than a third</a> of June's CPI increase, after a computer chip shortage <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d7d4ad2-63ef-45f0-adee-a4b7abe3d027\">curtailed </a>new car production. </p> <p>Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management, warned that the third month of headline inflation above 4 per cent highlighted a risk of prices continuing to rise as GDP growth slowed. </p> <p>“An even bigger risk for investors, more so than inflation, is stagflation, which would bring rising consumer prices without much economic growth,” Davis said. “Stagflation could hurt bonds and stocks at the same time.”</p> <p>In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 benchmark closed flat to retain its record high hit a day earlier. Bourses in the UK, Germany and France were also little changed on the day. </p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil marker, rose 1.8 per cent to settle at $76.49 a barrel following a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/105e7c30-6e70-4498-a854-83288bd9cea4\">volatile session</a> for commodities on Monday, driven by concerns about the coronavirus Delta variant and China's economy. </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Joe Rennison and Eric Platt in New York 2021 'Dollar rallies and big tech gains after further uptick in US inflation' FT.com 13 July.
