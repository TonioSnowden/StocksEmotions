  "title": "'Six California Kitchens' Review: A Hunger for Simplicity; Before there were foodies or Instagram-ready restaurants, Sally Schmitt started a revolution at the original French Laundry.",
  "text": "<p>Structured around the most important kitchens in her life, the book begins with Schmitt's early culinary education in the 1930s and '40s at her mother's elbow in their Sacramento Valley homestead, where a cow provided copious milk and their garden and fruit trees supplied bountiful produce for their large family. After a college degree in home economics, she moved with her husband to Fresno, where, as a young housewife in the 1950s and '60s, she discovered a passion for cooking while feeding her family, which grew to include five children. Eventually, she started cooking professionally, and many of her offspring followed her into the food business.</p><p>\"Six California Kitchens,\" written with family friend Bruce Smith, is the rare cookbook in which the personal history, recipes, margin notes and photographs are all equally compelling. What emerges from Schmitt's life story is a portrait of a Depression baby who learned at a young age the satisfaction of nurturing people by bringing them together for lovingly prepared meals.</p><p>With no formal training (and no mention of what she did about childcare), Schmitt moved with remarkable ease into the restaurant industry in 1967, when she and her husband became managing partners in the conversion of a rundown, 100-year-old brick winery building in Yountville into a shopping arcade. Schmitt's first commercial gig was to run—and upgrade the offerings of—the casual Vintage Cafe, which boasted Napa Valley's first espresso machine. By 1970, Schmitt opened an additional eatery in the complex, the Chutney Kitchen, which served lunch and later added popular monthly prix-fixe dinners, which included California-Mexican dishes.</p><p>From there, the Schmitts moved to an even more exciting Yountville project: buying and renovating an old stone building that had once housed a French laundry. Determined to keep things as simple as possible, they created an inviting 50-seat restaurant with a minimal staff. Employees would split the 15% service fee charged in lieu of tipping (another pioneering initiative).</p><p>Thomas Keller—who bought the French Laundry from the Schmitts in 1994—extols his predecessor in a foreword as \"a culinary pioneer but also a throwback, preparing dishes that evoked the most delicious versions of your favorite childhood meals.\" To Schmitt's delight, he included her apple cranberry kuchen recipe in his 1999 French Laundry cookbook. The kuchen's accompanying hot cream sauce—equal parts butter, sugar and heavy cream—sent Julia Child fluttering into the kitchen to ask Schmitt, \"My dear, what was in that sauce? . . . Why, of course. Butter!\"</p><p>A Garden of Reading Delights: Our Spring Books Issue</p><p>https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-garden-of-reading-delights-our-spring-books-issue-11649449084</p><p>PHOTO: Christopher Serra for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Discover the best of the season in fiction, history, politics, memoir, nature, cooking, kids books and more.</p><p>Schmitt's first proposed title for this book was \"Simply Delicious,\" which is an apt description of her cuisine. \"In all of my six kitchens, I have been a California cook, making use of the food around me—in season, local, fresh, and carefully raised.\" All the wines served at her restaurants were from local vintners, and even the olive oils were California-grown: \"I find it ridiculous to purchase olive oil from the Mediterranean when we are so capable of producing olive oil in our own climate,\" she writes.</p><p>After selling the French Laundry, the Schmitts moved to the Apple Farm in Philo, where three generations worked together, and where Sally taught farm-to-fork cooking classes. Her teaching chops are evident on every page, all infused with her kitchen credo: \"Work clean, work neat, and work carefully.\"</p><p>Schmitt's preferences were strong. She eschewed supermarkets, food processors, microwaves and—at home—dishwashers. She didn't like cabinets, preferring open shelving above countertops and drawers below. Her only plug-in appliances were a blender and a toaster, and the blender was stowed in a drawer. She loved warm, golden-hued wood, hanging copper pots and rustic pottery, and couldn't abide a messy kitchen. She insisted that washing up is \"part of the process of cooking.\"</p><p>Readers interested in the nuts and bolts of running a restaurant will marvel at Schmitt's smart planning, including her decision from day one at the French Laundry to follow the blueprint she'd developed at the Chutney Kitchen. Her five-course, prix-fixe dinners balanced flavors, textures and colors: three choices of appetizer (one fish, one vegetarian, and one dealer's choice, \"a product of my imagination\") were followed by a daily soup, entrée, and green salad with cheese. Meals ended with three choices of dessert (one chocolate, one baked and one fruit). Tables were booked for the evening; no rush to turn them over for multiple seatings allowed for a more comfortable pace in both kitchen and dining room.</p><p>As for the food: \"Six California Kitchens\" scores high on what I call a cookbook's IQ—Irresistibility Quotient. Temptations include seared duck breasts with a kumquat-mustard glaze, potato and celery-root soup with herbed butterballs, and rhubarb shortcake. Often rich in butter and half-and-half, many of Schmitt's recipes are not for the cholesterol-leery. But they are all clear and precise. An example of Schmitt's admirable concision is the directive to halve tomatoes \"through the equator\" for the tomato concassé that accompanies her braised lamb and eggplant. She also shares tricks of her trade, such as making \"Better Mayonnaise\" (doctoring store-bought mayo with sorrel or sesame oil to enhance fish and vegetables); roasting rather than stewing rhubarb to hold its shape; and adding a bit of water to eggs to make omelets more tender.</p><p>\"I was never into complexity,\" Schmitt writes. \"When I ate something, I wanted to know what I was tasting. So I liked having just one or two flavors that would stand out in a dish.\" Packed with wisdom accrued over decades, \"Six California Kitchens\" stands out as a paean to the considerable satisfactions of doing what you love, both for and alongside those you love.</p><p>Ms. McAlpin reviews books regularly for the Journal, the Christian Science Monitor and NPR.org.</p><p>'Six California Kitchens' Review: A Hunger for Simplicity</p>",
