  "title": "Business News:  Ford Posts  Surprise  Profit on  New Cars  ----  By Mike Colias",
  "text": "<p>    Ford Motor Co. posted a surprise second-quarter profit and raised its earnings outlook for the year, saying it sees an easing to the computer-chip shortage that has hampered vehicle output for months. </p><p>   Ford said it expects to boost deliveries to dealerships globally by 30% during the second half of the year, which should bolster the bottom line despite the sting of rising commodity costs. The chip shortage prompted Ford to slash in half its second-quarter production plans, to about 700,000 vehicles. </p><p>   Still, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley called the chip-shortage situation fluid. Tesla Inc., Volkswagen and Apple Inc. recently warned that the shortage could continue to disrupt production in the months ahead. </p><p>   Ford has been especially hard hit by the computer-chip shortage that has curtailed global auto manufacturing since January. Company executives have pointed to the fallout from a fire at a chip maker in Japan in March, which exacerbated the problem for many of its suppliers. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Ford's finance chief, John Lawler, said he sees the chip shortage improving during the third quarter, which should allow Ford to clear a backlog of orders for new vehicles, including the electric Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle and a new Bronco SUV that is just entering production. </p><p>   \"We're spring-loaded for growth,\" Mr. Lawler said. </p><p>   The brighter outlook comes as the U.S.'s second-largest auto maker by sales posted a $561 million net profit for the second quarter, as the strength of the new-car market helped offset hefty production losses from the continuing computer-chip shortage. </p><p>   Ford also raised its full-year pretax profit guidance to between $9 billion and $10 billion, up from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion earlier. </p><p>   Ford shares rose about 4% in after-hours trading following the results. </p><p>   Auto executives and dealers have been navigating a turbulent market as the U.S. recovers from Covid-19 pandemic. The chip shortage and other supply-chain disruptions have led to bare dealership lots and sporadic factory shutdowns. </p><p>   At the same time, new-car demand is booming as American car shoppers, flush with savings, look to take advantage of low interest rates and lofty values for their used-vehicle trade-ins. The pace of vehicle sales hit near-record levels in April and May, before cooling this summer as inventory problems worsened. </p><p>   Rival General Motors Co. reports second-quarter financial results next week. </p><p>   Ford said in April that it expects the semiconductor shortage to cause production losses of about 1.1 million vehicles this year, for a bottom-line hit of about $2.5 billion. But stronger vehicle demand and pricing, combined with lower-than-expected costs, helped lift results for the quarter. </p><p></p>",
