  "text": "<p>Get used to the vast scale. Isaac Asimov's <em>Foundation</em> series, Hugo award-winning as the greatest of all time, has long been considered near-unfilmable. Showrunner David S Goyer, whose screenwriting credits include <em>The Dark Knight </em>trilogy and the <em>Blade</em> franchise, has worked with the Asimov estate to update a story whose first volume was published 70 years ago. The result is respectful and respectable. </p> <p>The core character is mathematician-philosopher Hari Seldon (Jared Harris), whose field is “psychohistory”: “the destiny of the human race expressed in numbers”. Unfortunately for him, his calculations predict the imminent collapse of the Imperial Cleon dynasty, and with it all civilisation. “The Empire will fall . . . it's what the math tells me.” To avert mass panic and a self-fulfilling prophecy, the triple-cloned emperors — a child, a mature man and an aged one called Dawn, Day and Dusk — seek another genius mathematician to refute his thesis. </p> <p>Gaal is a young woman from a backward planet called Synnax who has won a galaxy-wide competition to solve a maths problem. Summoned to Trantor, the emperors' sumptuous home planet, she might be the one who can prove him wrong. “You are if I was but I'm not,” is Seldon's smug response. </p> <p>Gaal is so smart she recites vast strings of primes whenever she needs to take a breather, and asks questions like: “Does the algorithm allocation weight towards heterogony?” So far it's a blameless if somewhat bland performance from newcomer Lou Llobell, at least until Gaal gets a love interest. Maths by the way is not so much doing sums on paper as waving hands in the air, organising CGI sparks into swirling columns and patterns. The actors frequently adopt that rapt “they'll fix it in post” expression. </p> <p>The Imperium has based its look on Ancient Rome, with its columns, statues, armour and robes — appropriate given that Edward Gibbon's <em>Decline and Fall</em> was Asimov's own inspiration. In the palace all seems ordered and serene, with Lee Pace as a calmly psychopathic Day, savouring a meal one moment and exploding someone into a mass of wet, red sand the next. The emperors decide to banish Gaal and Seldon to Terminus, the planet at the edge of the galaxy, to preserve what they can of human culture: “They will be allowed to build their Foundation.” The most Seldon can promise with his “math” is to shorten the duration of the coming dark age. </p> <p>Terminus is a heap of rocks, but Trantor looks magnificent with its space elevator and whirling “jump ships”. At this point the acting and script are standard for the genre: neutral, passionless, rising to a light pomposity. For the moment it's left to Pace and Harris to strike all the sparks.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from September 24</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Suzi Feay 2021 'Foundation — Jared Harris stars in Apple TV Plus's ambitious sci-fi series' FT.com 24 September.
