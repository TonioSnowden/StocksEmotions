  "text": "<p>For nearly 40 years, academic books on Viking history have tended to emphasise the same message: our medieval Scandinavian visitors were much maligned by popular novelists and film-makers. Grown-up historians regarded the Vikings as “traders not raiders”: peaceful merchants who played a large role in integrating the sluggish and moribund economy of Europe in the Dark Ages with that of the Byzantine and Arab worlds. Moreover, they <em>never</em> wore horned helmets.</p> <p>It is therefore rather refreshing that Cat Jarman opens <em>River Kings</em>, her brilliant and unusually wide-ranging new history of the Vikings, with a good old-fashioned Viking massacre. She tells us how, in the winter of 873-74, the advance guard of the Viking Great Army mounted the horses they had extracted by blackmail from the East Anglians and headed swiftly south from their camp at Torksey down the old Roman road towards Lincoln. The rest of the army followed in longboats, sailing silently down the River Trent.</p> <p>Both groups knew exactly where they were going: the royal monastery of Repton, burial places of the kings of Mercia. Taking the royal guard by surprise, the Vikings made short work of the defenders, and began to plunder the abbey. Any surviving locals were herded into slave pens from where they were set to work on building a massive earthwork fortification around the desecrated monastery and abutting the banks of the Trent. It was there that their longboats were beached.</p> <p>Finally, they gathered their own dead, made a human sacrifice of four young slaves and laid to rest the bodies of their warriors on a clean deposit of red sand. The bodies were buried with their swords and their jewellery — perhaps surprisingly, the Vikings showed a dandyish fondness for brooches and necklaces, and those made of exotic carnelian beads from India seem to have been particularly popular.</p> <p>Over a thousand years later, in the summer of 1982, a small team of archaeologists were digging in a mound in the garden of the long-suffering vicar of Repton when they came across a gory find: an enormous charnel of human bones, many of them clearly men of enormous size, among whom were a few coins dating from the reign of Alfred the Great (871-886). At first it was presumed that these must be particularly large Friar Tuck-like monks. But then weapons began emerging, and a few of the skeletons turned out to be sword-wielding warrior women.</p> <p>It gradually became clear that the diggers had stumbled upon one of the most important discoveries since Sutton Hoo: the first Viking camp to be found outside Scandinavia. It was also the first archaeological evidence of any sort for the Viking Great Army, whose murderous activities under Guthrum were described in such splendidly gory detail by the <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em>.</p> <p>I should declare an interest: aged 17, on my summer holidays, I was among the 10 diggers at work in the vicar's garden when the charnel of 264 bodies was found. With it was the carnelian bead, resting near the skull of one especially huge warrior. It was a thrilling summer, that in many ways changed the direction of my life. </p> <p>Frustratingly, the full report on Repton has yet to be published, the site was backfilled and most of the finds have yet to be put on public display. Moreover, there was a slight feeling in some quarters that our finds — replete with graphic evidence of rape, slaughter and mayhem — were somehow shamefully unfashionable, defying the prevailing academic narrative of those peaceful trading Vikings.</p> <p>Jarman, a Scandinavian archaeologist based in Britain who did her PhD on the Repton charnel, is the perfect person to resolve this conundrum, and she does so with great skill, clarity and narrative drive. For Jarman likes her Vikings violent, and her tale — replete with witches, human sacrifice, Greek fire and funeral orgies — is at least as lively as any Netflix Viking romp, and a great deal more intellectually satisfying.</p> <p>It helps that she has an enviable gift for turning dry archaeological data into thrilling human stories as she weaves cutting-edge science with chronicles, histories and Nordic sagas, moving effortlessly from laboratory readings of strontium and carbon-14 to the tales of the Icelandic bard Snorri Sturluson and legends of the Valkyries. In this way she gradually reveals the extraordinary history of the Vikings' activity from Greenland and the Baltic to the walls of Constantinople and the bazaars of Baghdad. Some of it was peaceful; much of it was not.</p> <p>The narrative carries us from the familiar tale of the first Viking raid on the unsuspecting monks of Lindisfarne in 793 and the Viking hit-and-run attacks into the heart of the English countryside until 865, when the Great Army landed and began to move to the wholesale colonisation of the Danelaw. </p> <p>Much less well known is the tale Jarman then tells of the Viking voyages eastward, past the Baltic and then through a network of rivers over the fearsome rapids of the Dnieper to the Black Sea and down the Volga to the Caspian. Through these gateways they reached Byzantium — known by the Vikings as Micklegarth — where Jarman escorts us round the runic graffiti and carvings of dragon-headed warships left behind in the Hagia Sophia by the northern visitors.</p> <p>Yet even Byzantium was not the end. Beyond lay the riches of the Abbasid Caliphate whose silver dirham became the dollar of its time and a prized currency whose silver content could be relied upon in distant Scandinavia.</p> <p>Linking both these disparate worlds like a clasp is the small carnelian bead we found with our trowels in the vicar's garden that summer in 1982. Jarman found an almost identical bead in another Viking riverside fortress, in Ukraine, and she traces the origin of both beads beyond the bazaars of Constantinople and Baghdad — through which they must have passed — to their source in distant Gujarat, western India. The book ends with Jarman finding the very last man who still makes these beads in a workshop outside Ahmedabad, where carnelian still outcrops in the cliffs outside the city.</p> <p>After putting down my trowel in Repton, I left Viking archaeology to swim in the warmer waters of India's ocean, and reading <em>River Kings</em> seemed to bring two disparate halves of my life together in the most wonderful and unexpected way. But the book — one of the most thrilling works of archaeological detective work I have ever read — will cast a spell on any reader who enjoys their history well-written and clearly argued. Just as Antony Beevor's <em>Stalingrad</em> reminded us that the eastern front of the second world war was of far greater consequence than its western theatre, so Jarman shows how the westward trading and slaving voyages of the Vikings were only half the story. The real source of Viking wealth lay far to the east.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0008353077?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0008353077\"><strong>River Kings</strong></a><strong>: A New History of the Vikings from Scandinavia to the Silk Road</strong>, by Cat Jarman, <em>William Collins, RRP£25, 336 pages</em> </p> <p><em>William Dalrymple is a historian and author of ‘The Anarchy'</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
