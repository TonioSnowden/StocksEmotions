  "text": "<p>\n  Fitness clubs have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>\n  State and local governments shut gyms for months as the virus spread, with 17% of facilities in the U.S. closing down permanently last year, according to IHRSA, a health and fitness association. </p><p>\n  Crunch Fitness has been spared much of the pain. Only six Crunch clubs have closed permanently during the pandemic (four of them in Canada), out of a current total of 386. </p><p>\n  It lost about 2% of its pre-existing members between March 2020 and January 2021. But overall membership rose 6% in that period, and by the middle of this year, it was up 11% from March 2020. Crunch opened 40 clubs last year and expects to launch 70 this year. </p><p>\n  The Wall Street Journal spoke with Ben Midgley, chief executive of Crunch Franchise, which oversees the company's franchise network, to discuss trends in the industry, and Crunch's plans for continued growth. Here are edited excerpts of that conversation. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What changes that have taken place in the fitness industry during the pandemic will be permanent? </p><p>\n  MR. MIDGLEY: It's all about hybrid fitness now. In the past, people went to the gym, or exercised at home, or exercised outside. Coming out of the pandemic, we believe people will use all three options, based on what is most convenient and comfortable. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What accounts for Crunch's increase in membership during the pandemic? </p><p>\n  MR. MIDGLEY: We offered digital workouts. Before, you had to have more than a basic membership to access online workouts., but now they go to all members. The user count went up to 100,000 per day. With members returning to the gym, the online workouts have seen a reduction of approximately two-thirds. When clubs reopened, membership sales were three times the normal level. People wanted to get back to the community. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: How do you keep expanding your customer, especially with fewer people in general going to the gym? </p><p>\n  MR. MIDGLEY: Demand in fitness will be higher, I think, because people have been putting on a little weight during the pandemic. </p><p>\n  We've put in a few new features this year. That includes the Crunch-O-Meter, an app that gauges how many people are in a club at a specific time. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What about the digital side? And does the rise of Peloton and other at-home fitness programs represent a threat to you? </p><p>\n  MR. MIDGLEY: We're putting a higher emphasis on digital offerings. We're not looking to compete with Apple and Peloton. But we will upgrade our content to make it more engaging and interesting. </p><p>\n  One thing we'll do is improve how members can integrate their exercise with wearables. This will allow exercisers to see data, such as heart rate and calories burned, on the TV screen or computer they're using to follow the class. We also are investing in a new production studio and a new delivery platform that will reach more devices in addition to mobile, such as Roku and Apple TV. </p><p>\n  The growth of digital hasn't hurt us. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: How do you maintain interest for people to open new franchises? </p><p>\n  MR. MIDGLEY: One thing that helps is real-estate opportunities are better. A lot of landlords and retailers want us in their shopping centers, because vacancies have grown. We provide a lot of foot traffic. We were getting great opportunities before the pandemic, and it's even better now. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Will the losses suffered by some of your competitors during the pandemic help you? </p><p>\n  MR. MIDGLEY: There is less competition, with a lot of orphaned club members looking for a place to go. We'll benefit, and so will some others, like Planet Fitness. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What is Crunch's biggest challenge now? </p><p>\n  MR. MIDGLEY: It's adapting to the new normal: digital and cleanliness. In the past, the media would run exposes about health clubs with hygiene issues. But now there is so much cleanliness in clubs that it won't go away. The digital component will keep growing. We want to grow our digital offerings as fast as we can before the competition catches up, which they will. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Weil is a writer in West Palm Beach, Fla.
