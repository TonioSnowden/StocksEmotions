  "title": "Samsung Posts Record Quarterly Revenue From Chip Boom; Third-quarter results for the South Korea chip maker, an industry bellwether, exceed expectations",
  "text": "<p>Samsung, the world's largest memory-chip and smartphone maker, reported revenue of 73.98 trillion won for the quarter ended Sept. 30, a 10.5% rise from the prior year. The performance topped analysts' estimates and highlighted the strength of demand for digital products and services that also recently have lifted the earnings of other tech players as diverse as Microsoft Corp. to Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</p><p>The South Korean tech giant is considered an industry bellwether as it is both a major electronics maker and components supplier to big tech firms including Apple Inc. and Sony Group Corp.</p><p>Broader component shortages could begin to \"somewhat ease\" in the second half of 2022, said Han Jin-man, executive vice president at Samsung's memory business, on a Thursday earnings call. The current woes may have less to do with chip-production shortfalls than buyer behavior creating a mismatch in the supply chain, he said.</p><p>\"Compared to a case where the problem is caused by an absolute shortage of capacity, things could start to improve earlier than expected,\" Mr. Han said.</p><p>Samsung's results were driven by the strength of memory chips that go inside mobile devices, personal computers and data servers. Operating profit for Samsung's chip division in the July-to-September quarter rose 82% from the prior year to 10.06 trillion won, while revenue rose 40% to 26.41 trillion won.</p><p>But memory prices may fall in the coming months due to slowing demand as buyers struggle to source other kinds of parts. Component shortages are constraining the assembly of tech products such as personal computers and smartphones, in turn lowering the need for memory chips, according to Taiwan-based research firm TrendForce.</p><p>Contract prices for DRAM, which enable multitasking on devices, are expected to fall between 3% to 8% from the prior quarter, according to TrendForce. Similar prices for NAND flash memory, which provides storage on tech devices, are projected to be flat or fall by up to 5% on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the firm said.</p><p>Samsung is the No. 1 producer of DRAM and NAND memory chips. The firm, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp., also ranks among the largest—and most deep-pocketed—contract chip manufacturers.</p><p>The company's foundry business reported record quarterly results. Production capacity has nearly doubled since 2017. Samsung, which has set aside tens of billions of dollars in fresh investments, aims to triple its manufacturing capacity by 2026.</p><p>Samsung's success selling chips and other parts amid shortages hindered the firm's mobile division, where third-quarter operating profit declined by about 25% from the prior year. Revenue slid by 7%.</p><p>\"The situation does not seem to be easing. So it seems that even the fourth quarter will also have to bear with the part or component supply issues,\" said Kim Sung-koo, vice president at Samsung's mobile communications business.</p><p>In August, Samsung introduced two new foldable phones, devices with screens that can bend in half, and saw some uptick in consumer interest after years of modest demand. In its home country of South Korea, the two phones together ranked among Samsung's fastest-ever rollouts in terms of unit sales.</p><p>The higher-end Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G was launched at $1,800 while the smaller-size Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G started at $1,000. But Samsung has offered aggressive promotions for both devices, including allowing users to trade in multiple devices for discounts.</p><p>Nonetheless, the higher price tag did help boost Samsung's mobile profit, said CW Chung, head of Asia technology research at Nomura Securities.</p><p>Though foldable sales held up, Samsung's overall phone shipments declined because of the component shortage. Samsung said it sold about 72 million handsets in the July-to-September period. A year earlier, the company sold roughly 80.4 million units during the same three months.</p><p>The global smartphone industry is facing challenges sourcing key parts such as display drivers, power-management chips and application processors, according to Counterpoint Research, a tech market research firm.</p><p>Write to Jiyoung Sohn at jiyoung.sohn@wsj.com</p><p>Samsung Posts Record Quarterly Revenue From Chip Boom</p>",
