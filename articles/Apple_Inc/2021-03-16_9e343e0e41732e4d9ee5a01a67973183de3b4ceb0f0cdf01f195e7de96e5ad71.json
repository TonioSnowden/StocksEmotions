Apps that are found to disregard the user's choice will be rejected [from the App store].”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chinese internet companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79c2459d-85fe-457b-bb09-26d587eeaed6\">have pulled an Alibaba internet browser</a> from their app stores a day after President Xi Jinping warned that Beijing's crackdown on big tech companies was just beginning.
