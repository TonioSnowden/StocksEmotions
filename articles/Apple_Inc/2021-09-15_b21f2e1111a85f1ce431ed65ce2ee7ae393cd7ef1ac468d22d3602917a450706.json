  "text": "<p>\n  In a world where screens seem to only get bigger each year, I have to give credit to Apple for innovating on its little devices. I'm someone with small hands who directly benefits from the company's mini strategy. </p><p>\n  At its annual fall product launch, streamed on Tuesday, Apple unveiled refinements to its smallest screen, the Apple Watch, introducing the Series 7 -- whose highlight was a tiny, full-size keyboard. The company gave its most portable tablet, the iPad Mini, an all-new design, with a larger display and no home button on the front, in the same handheld size. </p><p>\n  To keep the mini love going, even the new iPhone 13 Mini got some significant updates: a bigger battery and a new image stabilizer for improved low-light photos, first announced with last year's gargantuan iPhone 12 Pro Max. </p><p>\n  It's mostly good news for the small-screen niche. But the bad news is that people who want mini will still have to pay max pricing. Prices didn't come down from previous generations -- the cost of the new iPad Mini is higher. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Apple Watch Series 7 </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  You might have to squint to notice the screen difference between the Apple Watch Series 7 and last year's Series 6, but there is one. </p><p>\n  The edges are even more rounded and the borders around the screen are narrower to make way for a larger screen. Apple says this design means 20% more screen area, 50% more on-screen text and a new full-sized keyboard for tapping or swipe-typing messages. You could send a whole email from your watch if you wanted to! Buttons are bigger, too, in apps such as the Stopwatch, Activity and Alarm. </p><p>\n  The size of the watches increased slightly as well. The smaller model is now 41 millimeters, up from 40mm, and the larger size is 45mm, up from 44mm. Previous Apple Watch bands will work with the Series 7. Apple hasn't released details, such as weight, for the watch models, but the bulkier hardware could be a turnoff for some small-wristed folks. </p><p>\n  Another refinement: The Series 7 is slightly more durable. Apple says the new watch's thicker display is \"crack-resistant\" and has a new IP6X certification, so it isn't fazed by dust. The watch's water resistance (rated for up to 50 meters in depth) hasn't changed. </p><p>\n  Unfortunately, the new model has the same battery life -- 18 hours -- as previous Apple Watches, so you'll still need to charge it every day. It can charge faster: Eight minutes on the new USB-C charger can power up the watch for eight hours, enough for sleep tracking. In 45 minutes, the Series 7 watch can go from 0% to 80% battery. </p><p>\n  There are no additional health sensors in this model. My colleague reported that Apple is planning a blood-pressure sensor and a wrist-based thermometer for its wearable that will likely be announced in future generations. </p><p>\n  Apple didn't announce a release date for the Series 7, saying it will be available sometime later this fall. The new watch starts at $399, and will replace the Series 6. Apple will continue to sell the $279 Apple Watch SE, which has a smaller screen and similar battery life, but lacks an ECG heart monitor and blood oxygen sensor. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New iPad Mini </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  In some ways, the day's biggest news was the iPad Mini's redesign. Apple gave it the same look and feel as Apple's iPad Pro and Air tablets, and an even more powerful processor. The iPad Mini had the same design for years, enduring only minor performance bumps. </p><p>\n  Now, the portable tablet has a flat-edge design, a USB-C port, optional 5G connectivity and support for the Apple Pencil 2 (sold separately), which can magnetically attach to its side. The screen size increased to 8.3 inches from 7.9 inches. The Touch ID fingerprint sensor has moved to the power button. The new Mini runs the new A15 Bionic chip, making it up to 80% faster than its predecessor, according to Apple. </p><p>\n  The cameras have improved, too. There's a 12-megapixel rear camera, up from 8 megapixels, and True Tone flash. More important to our work-via-Zoom reality, the front-facing camera has been updated to a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with Center Stage, which automatically zooms and pans to keep you in frame. </p><p>\n  But the starting price, at $499, is $100 more than the last Mini's base price. And it only includes 64GB of internal storage; people who want to step up will have to pay $649 for 256GB of storage. </p><p></p>",
