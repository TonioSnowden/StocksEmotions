  "title": "Business News: Samsung Sees Demand Softening --- Electronics giant logs rise in revenue, but inflation is blunting boom in gadgets",
  "text": "<p>The results ended Samsung's streak of three consecutive quarters of record revenues initially driven by the pandemic-fueled chip boom.</p><p>Samsung, the world's biggest maker of semiconductors, smartphones and televisions, said its net profit for the second quarter rose 15.3% from the year-ago period to 11.1 trillion won.</p><p>The company is considered an industry bellwether as it is a major electronics maker as well as a component supplier for major tech companies such as Apple Inc.</p><p>SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., which compete with Samsung in the memory-chip business, said in their latest earnings calls that rising inflation and concerns over a recession had affected consumer confidence recently and prompted customers -- which includes PC and smartphone manufacturers -- to start tightening costs and adjusting inventories.</p><p>Samsung's earnings are driven primarily by memory chips. Prices of the two major types of memory -- DRAM and NAND flash -- are declining as electronics demand for PCs, smartphones and other gadgets weaken. They are each expected to fall by double-digit percentages in the coming months versus the prior year, according to forecasts from Taiwan-based TrendForce.</p><p>For the April-June period, Samsung benefited from a strong U.S. dollar and ongoing server demand for memory, though revenue growth cooled versus prior quarters. The company's semiconductor division operating profit rose 44% from the prior year to 9.98 trillion won, while revenues increased 24% to 28.5 trillion won during the same time frame.</p><p>The company said its mobile business took a hit from rising material and logistics costs, but revenue rose, driven by sales of premium devices. Samsung's mobile-and-networks division logged second-quarter operating profit of 2.62 trillion won, a 18.9% drop from the prior year. But revenue rose 29.4% year-over-year to 29.34 trillion won.</p><p>Samsung is preparing to launch a new version of its flagship foldable smartphones -- the brand's priciest models -- on Aug. 10.</p>",
