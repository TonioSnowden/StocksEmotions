  "text": "<p>Beijing's regulatory assault on China's tech industry has lopped $87bn off the net worth of the sector's wealthiest tycoons since the start of July, hitting the fortunes of magnates such as Tencent's Pony Ma and Pinduoduo's Colin Huang. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e6f9a08-37be-4ab3-ae15-953533ab33b5\">As Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong reports</a>, the combined net worth of the two dozen Chinese billionaires in tech and biotech whose holdings are tracked by Bloomberg has dropped 16 per cent since ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing went public in the US at the end of June.</p> <p>The $4.4bn listing, which Didi launched despite private warnings from Chinese authorities to delay it due to data security concerns, has been followed by a regulatory firestorm. </p> <p>Huang, founder of ecommerce site Pinduoduo, has been the worst affected with paper losses of $15.6bn, or a third of his wealth. Pony Ma, founder of internet group Tencent, has lost more than $12bn or 22 per cent of his wealth. He is now ranked as China's third-richest man behind Jack Ma, founder of rival company Alibaba. Jack Ma's fortunes have fallen $2.6bn over the same period but are down almost $13bn since authorities scrapped the initial public offering of Ant Group, the fintech platform he controls, in November.</p> <p>Alibaba itself suffered another blow at the weekend, with an employee accusing her supervisor of a sexual assault last month and saying the company initially <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/413078fb-c3f4-4dfd-8963-82c53c7c6166\">failed to respond </a>to her request for an investigation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, China's second-largest music streaming service has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f949a689-9e10-4a93-9b81-c8032ee3a620\">scrapped a $1bn initial public offering </a>in Hong Kong as concerns about the growing regulatory crackdown hit investor confidence. Cloud Village, the music streaming business of tech group NetEase, will not go ahead with its IPO this week due to a disappointing response from investors.</p> <p>In contrast, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacca56f-1da5-4721-90bf-a61383ab7eec\">we've learnt that ByteDance</a>, the owner of short-video app TikTok, has revived a plan to go public, aiming for a Hong Kong listing by early next year. </p> <p>For more on what's behind the new restrictions, check out<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a7476ee-bcd4-45ac-a165-3418e2de286a\"> our weekend Big Read </a>on why the crackdown has now spread to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aaf1b117-2efa-4e31-9fba-a67cdf3ffe1d\">gaming</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2a6fab8-2cf7-49f4-9027-ee18a064715f\">private tutors</a>.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. WhatsApp condemns Apple surveillance system</strong><br>WhatsApp has<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43c1aa97-c4e7-4301-913d-2c89cc63800d\"> condemned Apple's new child safety tools</a> as a “very concerning . . . surveillance system”, even as governments around the world have cheered the decision to proactively search for illegal photos of child sexual abuse. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a26eae3a-acd4-4ac2-b7df-fa12ba712cc6\">The FT View is</a> that Apple may hope that by co-operating with US authorities, it can fend off legislation forcing it to go further. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17013489-e88c-4345-8845-8a03b8b50f60\">Richard Waters says</a> Apple has risked looking ineffective at protecting users of its iMessage system from harmful content and some sort of action had seemed overdue.</p> <p><strong>2. Samsung chief to get jail release</strong><br>Lee Jae-yong, the billionaire head of the Samsung tech empire, will be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3857903c-ed62-4203-8c32-eba0340b2bee\">freed from jail on Friday.</a> Lee was granted parole on Monday, eight months after he was sent back to jail for bribing former president Park Geun-hye to help secure control of Samsung Electronics.</p> <p><strong>3. Delivery Hero takes</strong> <strong>Deliveroo stake</strong><br>Delivery Hero, the Berlin-based food delivery group, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90f5ef42-fe8b-4b09-a388-477cb1918d18\">built a 5 per cent stake in Deliveroo</a>, driving shares in its UK-based rival to their highest point since March's initial public offering. Shares in Deliveroo rose as much as 10 per cent to 360p on Monday — they listed at 390p.</p> <p><strong>4. SoftBank's internal tensions over compliance</strong><br>SoftBank's attempt last year to simultaneously pull off a pivotal sale of its T-Mobile stake and Japan's biggest share buyback unleashed an internal row over whether the investment group risked overstepping insider dealing rules, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/107fe840-1874-4fb2-a70b-f2f8f1381215\">report Kana Inagaki and Leo Lewis in Tokyo</a>. Within the past 12 months, issues have come to light that have cast doubt on its founder's promise to strengthen governance in the wake of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25f76710-fbde-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229\">debacles surrounding WeWork</a>&#xa0;and Greensill.</p> <p><strong>5. DraftKings trades for Golden Nugget</strong><br>US fantasy sports outfit DraftKings has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f857e397-adab-4b95-b308-caa59b8d2b49\">agreed to acquire </a>Golden Nugget Online Gaming for $1.56bn in an all-stock deal that more than doubles its valuation since it listed via a special purpose acquisition company last year. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/704598d1-9798-449c-89ed-0167241a3100\">This week's How to Lead</a> talks to Entain CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen about how the online gambling group has been boosting its tech team as it prepares to pilot a virtual reality “sports club”.</p> <h2>Tech week ahead</h2> <p><em><strong>Tuesday:</strong></em>&#xa0;Despite posting a record annual profit in May, <strong>SoftBank'</strong>s first-quarter earnings will probably be overshadowed by headwinds for its tech portfolio. Shares in ride-hailing company Didi have fallen 40 per cent below the June IPO price since Chinese regulators launched a data privacy crackdown, plunging SoftBank's Vision Fund billions of dollars into the red. Food delivery platform <strong>Zomato</strong> reports its first quarterly results after its well-received IPO in India. The South Korean maker of popular mobile video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, or PUBG, debuts on the Seoul stock exchange. <strong>Krafton</strong> raised 4.3tn won ($3.76bn) in its IPO, the second biggest offering on the benchmark Kospi index. In the US, game development platform <strong>Unity</strong> reports second-quarter results.</p> <p><em><strong>Wednesday:</strong></em><strong> Samsung Electronics</strong> is expected to cut the prices of luxury models, including the latest foldable Galaxy smartphones due to be unveiled at its latest Unpacked event today. Food delivery service&#xa0;<strong>Deliveroo</strong> reports on its first half in London. As its battle with Just Eat in the UK intensifies and regulatory pressures rise in continental Europe, investors may be concerned if losses widen further. In the US, <strong>eBay</strong> reports second-quarter earnings.</p> <p><em><strong>Thursday:</strong></em> Another food delivery service has earnings, with <strong>DoorDash</strong> reporting in the US, along with <strong>Airbnb</strong> and data analytics company <strong>Palantir</strong>. In Asia, <strong>Foxconn</strong> has its quarterly earnings call, with investors listening in for guidance from the iPhone assembler on its next growth engine: electric vehicles. Foxconn recently purchased a chip production plant in Taiwan, a major step toward securing a source of automobile semiconductors. <strong>Toshiba</strong> CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa will announce earnings from his first quarter of leadership, after being tasked to reconcile shareholders with a management that has been hit by past governance scandals.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Tech tools — Majority Bowfell soundbar</h2> <p>The main claim to fame of <a href=\"https://www.majority.co.uk/soundbars/bowfell/\">Majority's Bowfell soundbar</a> is that it's the best-selling soundbar on Amazon, which is probably due to its bargain price of $42 (£35). It is limited in size and sound — it is only 15in wide, but still contains twin speakers and a built-in subwoofer. The quality was punchy enough to outclass easily the sound from my LG bedroom TV and that is probably the best place for the Bowfell — providing a better audio experience from a flat-panel TV that is not your main living room set. There are plenty of connectivity options, including RCA leads and a Bluetooth link, but I got the best results from an optical cable (not included). A remote does come with the speaker, but there's no ability to control the volume from your main remote, so “remote bloat” is a problem here. The Bowfell is what you would expect for such a budget price, but could give you an audio boost in the right setting. </p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'China's biggest tech losers' FT.com 9 August.
