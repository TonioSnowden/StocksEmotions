  "title": "China Changes Covid-19 Playbook Amid Concerns of Widening Lockdowns; Beijing's top pandemic official spearheads fight in worst-hit province as businesses shut down, millions ordered to stay home",
  "text": "<p>The change in the mandatory hospitalization rules that have seen China through most of the pandemic is an acknowledgment that its current approach risks overwhelming hospitals amid a rapid increase in cases.</p><p>China recorded more than 15,000 symptomatic locally transmitted infections in 28 provinces so far in March, largely due to the spread of the more infectious Omicron variant, Mi Feng, spokesman for China's National Health Commission, told a news conference Tuesday.</p><p>The 5,154 new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections found Monday are the highest since early 2020, when the epidemic first erupted in China. About 4,000 were from the northeastern province of Jilin, according to data published by the health commission Tuesday.</p><p>The worsening outbreak there prompted authorities to ban travel to or from the province and restrict the movements of millions of residents.</p><p>The latest wave of infections has also seen nonessential businesses closed and travel restricted in the financial and industrial hubs of Shanghai and Shenzhen. Mounting concern that more cities will follow helped sparka selloff in shares of Chinese companies, sending key indexes to their lowest in years. Covid-19 outbreaks now pose the biggest risk to China's economy, according to Deutsche Bank's chief China economist Yi Xiong.</p><p>The majority of the new infections were in Jilin City and the nearby provincial capital of Changchun, where residents had already been placed under \"closed management.\"</p><p>Nonessential businesses must shut and people stay home, with one household member allowed out every other day to buy food and other necessities, while all residents undergo multiple rounds of testing.</p><p>Since the first case was detected in Jilin on March 1, new infections in the province had hovered around 100 a day. But numbers surged Saturday, and China's vice-premier in charge of its anti-Covid-19 strategy, Sun ChunlanSun Chunlan, arrived the next day to spearhead efforts to halt the outbreak.</p><p>Ms. Sun told authorities to speed up screening by using both nucleic acid and rapid antigen tests, state news agency Xinhua reported.</p><p>Seven hospitals were ordered to empty their wards and turn all efforts to treating at-risk and seriously ill Covid-19 patients. The province is also building five makeshift treatment facilities to house and observe mild and asymptomatic cases, bringing the available bed count to almost 30,000, according to data provided by the Jilin provincial government during a news briefing Tuesday.</p><p>These strategies were also picked up in updated official guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19 patients released by the National Health Commission on Tuesday evening.</p><p>It also formally included the use of Pfizer Inc.'s Covid-19 antiviral drug Paxlovid in the treatment plan. Chinese regulators gave a conditional approval of the drug for emergency use in China last month.</p><p>Outbreaks in the financial and technology hubs of Shanghai and Shenzhen, with 139 and 60 mostly asymptomatic new cases respectively Monday, prompted local authorities to restrict the movement of citizens.</p><p>More than 100 international flights set to arrive in Shanghai will be diverted to other Chinese cities starting next week to ease the pressure on the city's anti-pandemic work, the state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted China's aviation regulator saying Tuesday. The flight diversions will last until May 1, the regulator said.</p><p>The latest outbreaks, which have already led to major manufacturers from Apple Inc. supplier Foxconn to Toyota Motor Corp. to halt production at some factories, are also impacting logistics of goods in China.</p><p>Trucking operations in areas including Shenzhen, Shanghai, Tianjin and Qingdao are likely to slow down as drivers are frequently required to take Covid tests and present negative results due to local government requirements, said Danish container-ship company A.P. Moller-Maersk A/SA.P. Moller-MaerskA.P. Moller-Maersk A/S in an advisory on Monday. Warehouses in Shenzhen are closed until March 20, Maersk also said.</p><p>Shenzhen is requiring freight trucks entering from neighboring Hong Kong—which reported more than 27,000 cases on Tuesday—to change drivers at three designated border checkpoints in an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19, government statements showed.</p><p>On Saturday, Ms. Sun said in a televised speech to the pandemic task force managed by the cabinet, known as the State Council, that China should stick to \"the general policy of 'dynamic clearing' without wavering or relaxing.\"</p><p>Under the policy, local authorities are required to bring any outbreak under control as quickly as possible by identifying the source of infections and cutting further transmissions through testing and isolation.</p><p>The measures deployed in China vary from region to region and in length, depending on how big the outbreak is and local conditions such as population density and the resources available to authorities.</p><p>A Covid-19 forecasting system by China's Lanzhou University predicted Monday that if health authorities implement their containment measures in a timely and effective way, case numbers in the current wave would peak around now, with infections under control by early April and resulting in about 35,000 infections.</p><p>Raffaele Huang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sha Hua at sha.hua@wsj.com</p><p>China Changes Covid-19 Playbook Amid Concerns of Widening Lockdowns</p>",
