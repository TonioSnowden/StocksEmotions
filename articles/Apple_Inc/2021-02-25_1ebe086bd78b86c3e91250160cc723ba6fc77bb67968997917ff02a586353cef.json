  "title": "Foxconn  To Make  Fisker  Vehicles  ----  By Ben Foldy and Stephanie Yang",
  "text": "<p>    Foxconn Technology Group, the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer, has agreed to assemble cars for electric-vehicle startup Fisker Inc., the latest deal for the Apple iPhone assembler in its expansion into the auto sector. </p><p>   Taipei-based Foxconn and Los Angeles-based Fisker have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly produce more than 250,000 vehicles a year, the companies said. </p><p>   While the exact location has yet to be determined, Fisker Chief Executive Henrik Fisker said there is a very good chance initial production will be in the U.S., in part because Foxconn already has a factory in Wisconsin. </p><p>   \"They've got a factory there and quite a lot of land with quite a lot of possibility for expansion,\" he said in an interview. \"We haven't made a final decision on that but that's an obvious one.\" </p><p>   Shares in Fisker leapt 39% on the news, to $22.58. Fisker began trading publicly in October after merging with a special-purpose acquisition company backed by private-equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc. The shares are up 152% since the merger closed. </p><p>   The Foxconn collaboration is for Fisker's second model -- a higher-volume electric car that the company aims to start building in the fourth quarter of 2023. The car would be built on vehicle underpinnings developed by Foxconn and would be sold in North America, Europe, China and India. </p><p>   For Foxconn, the Fisker deal is the latest in a series of tie-ups with auto makers to jointly develop or build vehicles, including the then-Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV -- now Stellantis NV -- and China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. </p><p>   In recent years, some electric-vehicle startups like Fisker have been focusing on designing cars while outsourcing vehicle production, in a challenge to the traditional business model in the automotive sector, in which established car makers designed and produced their own vehicles. </p><p>   The deal with Fisker is the first in which Foxconn will actually manufacture the vehicles, and its first with a U.S.-based electric-vehicle company. </p><p>   The auto industry is confronting a wave of new tech companies and startups looking to break into the business, an effort being driven in part by new technologies like electric cars and autonomous driving that are reshaping the competitive landscape. Among them is Apple Inc., which has for years worked to develop its own car and recently held talks with Hyundai Motor Group to assemble an autonomous vehicle at a Kia Corp. plant in Georgia. The talks have since broken down, The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>   Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., has been looking to diversify beyond its core business of contract manufacturing for electronics. </p><p>   It has also made multiple attempts to expand manufacturing in the U.S. In 2017, Foxconn said it would invest $10 billion to build a liquid-crystal display factory in Wisconsin to produce large-screen televisions and other devices, a project that was praised by then-President Donald Trump. But since then, Foxconn has scaled back its ambitions to a smaller facility that would make smaller touch screens, and has been in a dispute with Wisconsin state officials over the scope of the project. </p><p></p>",
