  "text": "<p>1. A new group of social media-enabled day traders is helping push stocks to records and turning companies into market sensations.</p><p>Companies like NIO and Tesla are among those that have generated chatter. A surge in day trading has helped push these stocks to records amid the online buzz. \"People fall in love with [some stocks] and they get in these echo chambers, where they are all shouting, like, 'We're going to buy Tesla forever!'\" said Blake Bassett, a 31-year-old delivery driver who began trading several years ago. \"People post all day like it's a football game.\"</p><p>2.

Some industry veterans warn social-media posts can send too rosy a message about beginner trading.</p><p>\"Everybody only posts the wins,\" said Anthony Denier, chief executive of Webull, a brokerage that is popular with younger investors. \"Nobody sends a selfie on Instagram when they just woke up after a bender. It's when they're having their first cocktail for the night and they're all done up. It's the same for day traders\" posting their profits and losses. This can draw new traders in.</p><p>Read the original article by Caitlin McCabe, Gunjan Banerji and Mischa Frankl-Duval here.</p><p>Trading Newbies Turn to TikTok and Discord to Share Hot Stock Tips</p>",
