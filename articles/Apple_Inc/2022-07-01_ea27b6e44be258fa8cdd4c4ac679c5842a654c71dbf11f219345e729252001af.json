  "title": "How China's National Security Law Silences Hong Kong; Jailed pro-democracy leaders are being ground down by months without trial and the fear they will spend the rest of their lives behind bars",
  "text": "<p>\"A process is underway, and so far what we've seen demonstrates the fears that many observers had,\" said Jerome A. Cohen, a retired New York University law professor and Council on Foreign Relations expert. \"The worst is yet to come.\"</p><p>The law's vaguely worded provisions and uncertain red lines mean almost anything can be deemed a threat to national security, according to Amnesty International. Fear of punishment under it is pervasive, and not just among the small circle of hard-core activists the government says it is targeting. No one that spoke to the Journal in Hong Kong was willing to be identified by their full name—including defendants' family and friends who aren't suspected of any wrongdoing.</p><p>While the alleged crimes against national security include terrorism and conspiracy to murder, most are nonviolent offenses, from fraud to conspiracy to commit subversion, and advocating secession to publishing seditious articles.</p><p>In such cases, defendants would previously have expected to be released on bail. But the NSL has reversed the burden of proof, said Eric Lai, Hong Kong Law Fellow at Georgetown's Center for Asian Law. The defense must now prove to a judge that the defendant won't endanger national security.</p><p>\"How could I prove that a defendant will not do something in the future?\" Mr. Lai said. \"You can't offer any evidence, because it hasn't happened.\"</p><p>The system allowing denial of bail is too broad, he said. Prosecutors have successfully argued against bail for reasons such as receiving funds from supporters cleared in U.S. dollars, a text message from a foreign reporter or emails from the U.S. Consulate asking to meet.</p><p>By reversing the presumption of bail, the law becomes an instrument for arbitrary detention, consigning people to jail regardless of whether the accusations against them haven't been detailed or sufficiently proved, Mr. Cohen said.</p><p>Only 10 defendants now in jail have been given a date for trial—or even the chance to plead guilty. Andy Li and Chan Tsz-wah, accused of colluding with foreign forces together with Apple Daily's Jimmy Lai, haven't been sentenced, 315 days after pleading guilty.</p><p>\"It gives the prosecution a wonderful way of doing away with people they don't like,\" Mr. Cohen said.</p><p>A Department of Justice spokeswoman said bail applications have been handled \"fairly and adjudicated impartially by the court.\" It has also ensured cases are handled expeditiously and effectively, and has invited the courts to set early trial dates, she said. Even so, one-third of national-security defendants have been in jail for over a year, and eight minors detained for more than six months.</p><p>The Security Bureau told the Journal that by its reckoning, 196 people had been arrested under the NSL and 124 charged as of June 23. It declined to explain why its numbers differ from those used in this article, and which are as of June 30.</p><p>Lai Chun-pong has been in prison longer than any other NSL defendant, after plainclothes officers shoved a black hood over his head on Sept. 5, 2020, when they arrested him at his mobile-phone repair shop in neighborhood of Mong Kok. That isn't far from where the 31-year-old has been detained without trial for almost two years for allegedly plotting to kill police officers.</p><p>Mr. Lai was a respectful son from a humble background, his mother says, having fun with his friends but never in trouble. He had always supported her financially, too.</p><p>Now 65 and recently retired, she visits him every few days. Despite the severity of the allegations against him, Mr. Lai's mother said she doesn't know the details.</p><p>Conversations over the prison intercom always center on the banal—he should drink more water, do more exercise. Mr. Lai never talks about his worries, or the case, his mother said. She doesn't dare ask either, as conversations are monitored. \"Even if I did, I can't help him,\" she said.</p><p>The only news about her son comes from the 15-minute daily visits permitted to remand prisoners, or from court hearings that in the past have often only lasted for the few minutes it took government lawyers to get an adjournment approved by the national-security judge.</p><p>It was only through friends who visited him that she learned that her son had been placed in solitary confinement in May, but she doesn't know why, or for how long. The Correctional Services Department said it doesn't comment on individual cases.</p><p>\"I'd never dreamed that a young man would be jailed for two years for something he was only suspected of doing,\" she said. After such a long detention she fears her son, once an active and humorous person, will have grown depressed.</p><p>Being detained indefinitely has exhausted the resources of many defendants, whose household bills must somehow still get paid. Mr. Ng is among them.</p><p>Mr. Ng was unknown when he started his own online campaign to support an unofficial election to produce a unified roster of opposition candidates. The government, reeling from the massive protests in 2019, called the tactical-voting experiment an illegal conspiracy to topple it.</p><p>Now, Mr. Ng is one of the foremost defendants, accused of being one of the ringleaders in the alleged conspiracy. He faces at least 10 years and up to life imprisonment.</p><p>Ten months into his detention, Mr. Ng was denied state-funded legal aid to pay for a lawyer of his choice, so he began studying law to defend himself. A recent request for help with retrieving case law and printing legal documents was denied.</p><p>To raise his spirits, Mr. Ng's friends arrange his schedule for visitors, and send books and articles on topics he is interested in. One of his friends, who asked to be identified only by her pseudonym Beauvoir, said she mails more than 100 pages of articles to the jail every week.</p><p>\"We've been playing a game, but he doesn't know it yet,\" she said, leafing through printouts of news articles and research papers. \"I've been printing these articles in a slightly smaller font each time, to see when he'll start saying he has trouble reading them,\" she said with a giggle.</p><p>Prosecutors in the cases of the 47 democrats have sought three adjournments since they were first charged in March 2021, citing the need for time to translate and process thousands of pages of documents.</p><p>The defendants have yet to be given a date for when they can make their plea or to face trial.</p><p>The lengthy detention and repeated court appearances are a way to exhaust the defendants' resources, said Beauvoir.</p><p>\"It's just to delay it for long enough that you start to lose sense of what it is all for,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Selina Cheng at selina.cheng@wsj.com</p><p>How China's National Security Law Silences Hong Kong</p>",
