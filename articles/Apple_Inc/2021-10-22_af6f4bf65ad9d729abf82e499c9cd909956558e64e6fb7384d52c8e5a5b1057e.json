  "title": "Ex-CEO Makes  Rare Public Return  ----  By Eliot Brown",
  "text": "<p>   As WeWork Inc. made its debut Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange, the shared-office-space company's high-profile co-founder and former chief executive wasn't on stage ringing the exchange's opening bell. </p><p>   Instead, Adam Neumann was 2 1/2 miles to the north, celebrating with dozens of former employees at the Standard hotel in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, a person who attended said. </p><p>   It was a rare return to the public sphere for Mr. Neumann, who was ousted as CEO in fall 2019 after investors balked at WeWork's planned initial public offering. Briefly the country's most valuable startup -- worth $47 billion -- WeWork tumbled in valuation to about $8 billion as prospective investors were turned off by its swelling losses, lengthy conflicts of interest and a perception of erratic leadership. </p><p>   Since the 2019 debacle, Mr. Neumann has eschewed public appearances and media interviews. His retreat came as WeWork's fall from grace spawned a cottage industry of media dramatization: multiple podcasts; documentaries; and a forthcoming Apple TV series in which actor Jared Leto is playing Mr. Neumann and Anne Hathaway is playing his wife, Rebekah Neumann. </p><p>   Mr. Neumann has spent much of the past two years living a far more quiet existence than in his time as CEO. After a stint in Israel, where he was born, he and his family moved to one of their houses in the Hamptons, on the east end of Long Island, according to people who have spoken with him. </p><p>   Mr. Neumann negotiated one of the largest-ever severance packages with WeWork investor SoftBank Group Corp. -- one that was subsequently litigated. Including money paid after a settlement this year, Mr. Neumann received more than $198 million  from SoftBank, while an entity he controls sold $578 million in WeWork stock at a value above Thursday's closing share price of $11.78, according to regulatory filings. </p><p></p>",
