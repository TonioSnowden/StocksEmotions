  "text": "<p>   The biggest hip-hop album of the year so far isn't a 2021 release -- it was already blaring out of car windows a year ago. </p><p>   \"Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,\" the posthumous debut album from late New York rapper Pop Smoke, is 2021's most popular hip-hop album, according to MRC Data, formerly known as Nielsen Music, with the equivalent of 948,000 sales in the U.S. this year. Across all of music, \"Shoot for the Stars,\" which was released on July 3, 2020, is the fourth-most-consumed album, after records by Justin Bieber, Olivia Rodrigo and Morgan Wallen, MRC Data says. </p><p>   \"It's a cultural phenomenon,\" says Ebro Darden, global editorial head of hip-hop and R&amp;B for Apple Music. Among the album's songs is \"Dior,\" a previously released track that became a protest anthem during last summer's nationwide demonstrations over racial injustice. Meanwhile, the album has been a streaming favorite for the past year, keeping Pop Smoke near the top of the music charts month after month. </p><p>   To capitalize on the momentum, Pop Smoke's label, Victor Victor Worldwide, released a second posthumous album, \"Faith,\" on Friday. That album, which features appearances by Kanye West and pop star Dua Lipa, is timed for what would have been the rap star's 22nd birthday on Tuesday. </p><p>    Posthumous albums from artists such as rappers Juice WRLD and Mac Miller have been making waves in pop culture. \"Shoot for the Stars\" is among the most commercially successful in recent memory, cementing Pop Smoke as one of the most significant hip-hop figures of the past few decades. It also is a big moment for New York rap, which for years had been overshadowed by rival hip-hop scenes, especially in Atlanta. </p><p>   Pop Smoke, whose real name was Bashar Jackson, was a Brooklyn-based hip-hop newcomer before his death in February 2020 at age 20. As the leading voice of \"Brooklyn drill,\" a rap subgenre with dark, moody chords, intimidating lyrics and rumbling bass, he offered an alternative to the pop-leaning sounds of mainstream rap. </p><p>   Growing up in Brooklyn, Pop Smoke started recording in late 2018. Steven Victor, the head of Victor Victor Worldwide, signed him in March 2019. (Victor Victor Worldwide distributes Pop Smoke's music through a deal with Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.) By that summer, Pop Smoke was a local hero with a regional smash, \"Welcome to the Party.\" </p><p>   His swift rise ended on Feb. 19, 2020, when he was shot and killed in a home invasion in Los Angeles. When his debut album arrived in July, it hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album-sales chart. It is currently No. 12. </p><p>   The success of \"Shoot for the Stars\" rests on many factors, including Pop Smoke's musicality, charisma and perceived authenticity, industry executives say. He rapped in a distinctive style, bellowing in a gruff baritone over sinister instrumentals that were also melodic and danceable. </p><p>   Then there is the album's packed guest list, which includes of-the-moment rappers (DaBaby, Lil Baby, Roddy Ricch), hip-hop statesmen (50 Cent, Future, Young Thug) and giants from neighboring genres (Burna Boy, Karol G). </p><p>   Some music critics say the album, executive-produced by 50 Cent, is too commercial-sounding and overloaded with featured guests. But Pop Smoke had been aiming for mainstream acceptance, those who knew him say. </p><p>   \"Musically, on his early demos that he came in with -- he had that pop sensibility,\" says Shivam Pandya, vice president of operations for Victor Victor Worldwide. \"He always wanted to appeal to a wide audience.\" </p><p>   \"Shoot for the Stars\" has generated nearly 5 billion U.S. streams since its release, according to MRC Data. Many fans have been waiting for the latest album. \"If he left more music on this earth, the world should hear it,\" says Tariq Cherif, co-founder of the hip-hop festival Rolling Loud. </p><p></p>",
