  "text": "<p>I wasn't under any illusion that the Chinese Communist Party was teeming with incipient democrats. But I did think that hundreds of millions of newly middle-class Chinese would want political choice to go along with consumer choice. What better place to start experimenting with openness than in Hong Kong? Handed over by Britain to the People's Republic of China in 1997, the city had a strong tradition of freedom—and Britain and China had signed an international treaty promising that this tradition would be upheld.</p><p>When China entered the World Trade Organization at the end of 2001, I co-authored a book with the organization's incoming director-general, Supachai Panitchpakdi, predicting that membership would catalyze a new round of growth for China. How right we were about the economic growth—more right than even the most optimistic China bulls could imagine. How wrong we were to imagine that political openness would follow.</p><p>The shattering moment came for me at the end of February 2020. One morning, at 8 a.m., I got in a taxi outside my apartment in Hong Kong. I was on my way to meet media entrepreneur and pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai, a man I had known for three decades. Then I noticed that he had sent me an e-mail: \"I'm being arrested,\" he wrote, explaining that, understandably, he couldn't meet me for breakfast.</p><p>Mr. Lai, the founder of a fiercely pro-democracy newspaper called Apple Daily, would be arrested again and again that year—next in April, as part of a round-up of longtime democracy activists. When Mr. Lai was arrested once more in August, police alerted news photographers, who captured the spectacle of a handcuffed Mr. Lai brought from his house to company headquarters, where two hundred armed police stood by as he was perp-marched through the Apple Daily newsroom. This time he was not alone: Cheung Kim-hung, the CEO of the newspaper's parent company, Next Digital, was also arrested, as was chief operating officer Royston Chow.</p><p>Hong Kongers reacted by bidding up the company's share price and buying copies of the Apple Daily, which sold 500,000 copies the day after the arrests, more than five times normal. Mr. Lai, Mr. Cheung and Mr. Chow were charged with violating the vague and sweeping National Security Law that the CCP had recently imposed on Hong Kong. They were released on bail, but the message was unsettling, to say the least. Free speech, freedom of the press and rule of law were all supposed to be guaranteed under the Basic Law, the mini-Constitution that China itself had promulgated for Hong Kong. How could this have happened?</p><p>My stake was personal. I had joined Next Digital in 2018 as an independent, non-executive director. On an emergency board of directors' call immediately after the August arrests, it emerged that I was the only director still in Hong Kong and not in police custody. Beijing's bullyboy tactics were starting to hit uncomfortably close to home.</p><p>When I joined the Next Digital board, my goal was to improve the company's financial performance and help nurture a vibrant media sector in Hong Kong. Conventional wisdom held that Hong Kongers wouldn't pay for content. But the Chinese government had long encouraged advertisers to boycott the newspaper, and we had no choice but to ask our readers for support. It worked. We went to a pay model in September 2019, and within a year we had nearly 600,000 paying subscribers, approaching 10% of the Hong Kong population.</p><p>Our success enraged the authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong. In May 2021, Mr. Lai's shares in the company were frozen—without a court order—and the government even tried to seize some accounts he held in Singapore. The following month, June 2021, more than 500 armed police marched into the Apple Daily newsroom and took away Mr. Cheung again and editor-in-chief Ryan Law. The authorities went on to round up other journalists as well.</p><p>This time was even more serious than the last. Seven Apple staff remain in prison. Most are being held without bail—effectively presumed guilty before trial. They face national security law charges that can carry sentences of life imprisonment. The provisions of the Basic Law have apparently been suspended.</p><p>The remaining journalists at Apple Daily were committed to their work and would have soldiered on. But Hong Kong's then-secretary for security, John Lee, declared that he had \"reason to believe\" that our activities in some unspecified way violated the National Security Law, and he froze the company's bank accounts.</p><p>Unable to pay salaries, we had to fire some 800 employees, and the remaining skeleton staff quit in fear. Unable to pay our phone and electricity bills, the remaining directors resigned in early September. We did not have the power to liquidate the company, but we recommended that the government take this step, selling the company's assets and distributing the proceeds to those to whom we owed money. The government has followed our advice, and the company is being wound up.</p><p>Despite imprisoning the Apple Seven and freezing Next Digital's bank accounts, the government is out to prove that the company collapsed on its own accord, a result of poor management in a Hong Kong where press freedom remains alive and well. A special inspector, Clement Chan, from the accounting firm BDO, has been tasked with probing irregularities and mismanagement, the first time since 1999 that a special inspector has been appointed in the city of Hong Kong. The Securities and Futures Commission, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and the Financial Reporting Council are also making inquiries.</p><p>So I am well on my way to my 65th birthday, fighting for freedom. Freedom for Jimmy Lai and my other Apple Daily colleagues, for the scores of people held under the National Security Law, for the more than 10,000 Hong Kongers who face political charges from the pro-democracy protests of 2019 and 2020. I am fighting for the freedom of a once remarkable city, a place open to commerce and ideas, where China and the world could meet.</p><p>Today, Hong Kong is where the CCP is perfecting its playbook for smothering free and open societies. What China does in Hong Kong today it hopes to do in Taiwan tomorrow and everywhere else when it is able. From Australia to Lithuania, governments, journalists and activists are showing that resistance is possible. I don't know when or how we will turn back China's totalitarian juggernaut. But I know that we can and will win.</p><p>This essay is adapted from Mr. Clifford's new book, \"Today Hong Kong, Tomorrow the World: What China's Crackdown Reveals About Its Plans to End Freedom Everywhere,\" which will be published by St. Martin's Press on Feb. 1. He is the president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong.</p><p>China's Ambitions and the Fate of a Hong Kong Daily</p>",
