  "text": "<p>The NHK-Fintiv ruling clarified that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board doesn't have to review the validity of certain patents when they are already the subject of lawsuits that are advancing faster than they would before the board or have already concluded in federal courts. NHK-Fintiv thus doesn't prevent tech companies from challenging patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board; it merely prevents them from getting a second bite at the apple by filing challenges at the board if they've already lost, or are about to lose, patent-infringement suits in federal court. Big-tech infringers routinely file serial challenges.</p><p>The NHK-Fintiv ruling is eminently reasonable. It isn't appropriate to force a small patent holder to defend his intellectual property from deep-pocketed rivals again in the Patent Office after he has prevailed in court. The rule saves resources for everyone.</p><p>When the Patent Office sought comments in 2020 on using the office's discretionary authority to deny certain postgrant review proceedings, more than 800 organizations and individuals weighed in. The comments showed widespread support for what became the NHK-Fintiv opinion from small inventors, the life-sciences industry, research universities, intellectual-property organizations and several senators. No member of Congress submitted comments in opposition at the time. So, it's a bit rich for Mr. Mukasey to say this carefully considered action was \"unilateral.\"</p><p>Paul R. Michel</p><p>Alexandria, Va.</p><p>Mr. Michel was chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p><p>A Patent Rule Worth Defending</p>",
