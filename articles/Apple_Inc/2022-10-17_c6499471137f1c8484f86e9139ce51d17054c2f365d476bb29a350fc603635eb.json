  "text": "<p>Chevrolet Spark</p><p>Not a sedan, but not a crossover either, the Chevrolet Spark was the brand's smallest, least expensive car. Although equipped with standard Apple AAPL CarPlay and Android Auto, easy on gas, and easy to maneuver and park, the Spark was also underpowered, under-equipped in base form, and only offered driver assistance features with the top trim level.</p><p>Infiniti Q60</p><p>The Infiniti Q60 checks so many cancellation boxes, it's a miracle it made it this far. As a coupe, it's even more out of favor with the mainstream market than a sedan would be, and doubly so as a luxury-sports coupe. The fact that the Q60 was a gorgeous, fun-to-drive, well-equipped vehicle, as well as a compact coupe, is beside the point; if it doesn't ride high and look chunky, America apparently doesn't want it.</p><p>A must read: This Lay's x Balenciaga potato chip bag reportedly costs $1,800. Who's biting?</p><p>Hyundai Accent</p><p>There's a theme to the cancellations again this year, and it's Kill All Sedans, apparently. The 2022 Hyundai Accent will be the last of its name, despite being very affordable, fuel efficient, spacious for its size, and packed with easy-to-use tech. The Accent's primary shortcomings were once its assets. In a market where bigger is always better, smaller is often worse, and the Accent's small footprint was matched by a small trunk and underwhelming power from its 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine. Hyundai HYMTF thinks the Venue subcompact crossover will absorb the customers that would have bought the Accent.</p><p>Buick Encore</p><p>Wait a second. The Buick Encore is a crossover! If crossovers are so popular, why is this one being canceled? Probably because it's too small — the slightly larger, somewhat newer, similarly named Encore GX has proved more popular than the Encore, which was Buick's smallest vehicle. Based on the Chevrolet Trax, the Encore's look and feel was almost premium, but not quite, and the \"not quite\" part of that phrase didn't help the Encore win fans, either.</p><p>Also see: 'Lease offers are horrible.' Average payments are up 384%, but here are 7 reasons leasing a car can be better than buying.</p><p>Ford EcoSport</p><p>The Ford F EcoSport had some pluses — things like standard all-wheel drive, a large cargo area, and a low starting price — but there were plenty of downsides, too. This subcompact SUV did not have the fuel economy or modern features that would have kept it competitive with its rivals. It was smaller inside than other subcompact SUVs, and the base model was downright spartan.</p><p>Mercedes-Benz A-Class</p><p>Continuing the \"SUVs good, 4-doors bad\" theme, the 2022 Mercedes-Benz A-Class is the last of its kind. Despite engaging driving dynamics, lots of technology, and an upscale look and feel for a nearly mainstream price, the A-Class' 3-box body shape has also done it in. The small trunk and tight back seat certainly didn't help its case, nor did the awkward, sometimes clunky shifts from the transmission.</p><p>Volkswagen Passat</p><p>The Volkswagen Passat's midsize balance of size and efficiency was finely tuned for the American market — so much so that the U.S. received its own specification of Passat, built in VW's VWAGY Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant. Despite its spacious interior, sizable trunk, and ample standard safety features, the Passat failed to retain its fanbase in the face of the crossover onslaught, especially with weaknesses like no available all-wheel drive and underwhelming performance.</p><p>Honda Insight</p><p>As Honda's HMC dedicated hybrid model, the Honda Insight never quite rose to the challenge of competing with the Toyota Prius, in part because it arrived on the scene far too late. Now it's being replaced by the car that preceded it — a hybrid version of the Civic. Despite the poor timing and sedan body style, the Insight did have some strengths, like a comfortable, spacious cabin and up to 55 mpg around town. It also had weaknesses, like a noisy engine under heavy acceleration, a lack of driving dynamics, and limited trim and feature options.</p><p>Acura ILX</p><p>Although it was a remarkable value, with agile handling and solid safety features, the 2022 Acura ILX was also a sedan. This year that seems to be a leading indicator of a model's demise. Fortunately, for fans of Acura 4-doors, the ILX's death comes just after the rebirth of an Acura icon — the 2023 Integra. Without the Integra's inherent sporting abilities and name recognition, the ILX's failure isn't a tremendous surprise, especially in the age of the crossover.</p><p>Read next: Finally, new car inventory is up; what it means for car shoppers</p><p>Toyota Avalon</p><p>Once a name often mentioned near the word \"retirement,\" the Toyota Avalon grew to become one of the brand's most luxurious, well-sorted sedan offerings, approaching Lexus levels of quality and comfort. By the end of its run, the Avalon was among the best sedans on sale in the U.S. But being a sedan, even a reasonably large one, is a liability in today's market. The Avalon is another victim of its form factor, being outsold by crossover and SUV alternatives. But all is not lost for fans of large Toyota TM sedans. The automaker is set to bring its Crown sedan to the U.S. market for 2023.</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com .</p><p>10 cars that are being discontinued this year (and there could be bargains here)</p>",
