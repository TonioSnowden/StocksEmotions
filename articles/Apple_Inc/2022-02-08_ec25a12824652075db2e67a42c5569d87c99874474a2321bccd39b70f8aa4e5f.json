  "text": "<p>The frontrunner for this year's Oscars is Netflix's Western psychodrama <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f2af17e-cad5-4fc6-9ea7-68e5402dda5d\"><em>The Power of the Dog</em></a>, a nominee in 12 categories including Best Picture. Among a field of big hitters announced today there is also recognition for sci-fi blockbuster <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/625f9c2e-c573-41ef-b52e-f37ab390ca93\"><em>Dune</em></a> (10 nominations), Steven Spielberg's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb9fc43-0bd8-451d-a405-f55b074d2511\"><em>West Side Story</em></a> (seven) and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01aff5d2-ad9c-4558-8b8f-5d16e2c04be9\"><em>Belfast</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/051f1c1a-34a7-4ced-b441-1a2f809b1c22\">Kenneth Branagh</a>'s coming-of-age story (seven).</p> <p>The Academy would love the 2022 awards to be a comeback story. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/658a77b1-578f-44ec-9b26-a6d5dea79c93\">Last year</a>, a low-key, Covid-affected ceremony saw a dramatic fall-off in TV ratings. The hope is that the return of a grand bash filled with star names and box-office successes will help draw back public attention. </p> <p>Among the Best Picture contenders, <em>The Power of the Dog</em> reached most of its audience through streaming. Some rivals such as <em>Dune</em> have pulled significant crowds into cinemas, but <em>West Side Story</em> delivered a flat commercial performance despite enthusiastic reviews. Other nominees include <em>Belfast</em>; <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef1a3fb8-34c5-4029-ae62-0ac54725a83d\"><em>King Richard</em></a>, biopic of Richard Williams, father and coach of Venus and Serena; Japanese breakout hit <em>Drive My Car</em> and another Netflix title, comedy cause célèbre <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88ecb5ad-9fff-4142-9e24-d8dd7699eb7e\"><em>Don't Look Up</em></a>. </p> <p>Jane Campion, nominated as Best Director for <em>The Power of the Dog</em>, was previously shortlisted in 1994 for <em>The Piano</em>. A victory at next month's ceremony would make this the first time a woman took the prize two years running (Chloé Zhao having won in 2021 for <em>Nomadland</em>), yet Campion remains the only woman nominated in a category of five. </p> <p>In the acting categories, more recognition for <em>The Power of the Dog</em> finds Benedict Cumberbatch nominated for Best Actor alongside bookies' favourite Will Smith, up for his performance in <em>King Richard</em>. The leading contender for Best Actress remains Nicole Kidman, cast as Lucille Ball in biopic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03c4592-8b5d-4519-9c66-1c238a216dfd\"><em>Being the Ricardos</em></a>. <em>The Power of the Dog</em> features too in both supporting categories, with nominations for Kodi Smit-McPhee, Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst.</p> <p>Netflix will be hoping the 2022 Oscars make a good news story every bit as much as the Academy after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fea461d6-e3e0-4016-a641-fca87e59d019\">last month's dizzying fall</a> in the price of its stock. Aside from Campion's film, the streamer has four nominations for <em>Don't Look Up</em> and a further two for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/185a5c73-ec86-4a60-b873-fdf214af7d63\">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a>'s musical <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4a963ed-95bb-4032-ab5f-581fe23e4dea\"><em>tick, tick . . . BOOM!</em></a>. Apple's filmmaking arm takes three nominations each for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f33597f7-5f24-465b-acdf-c2025853a356\"><em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em></a> and the poignant comedy-drama <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec1aa69a-6bd8-41e9-84b1-41b3386749ac\"><em>CODA</em></a> (nominated for Best Picture).</p> <p>Among the old-school studios, Warner Bros may see partial vindication in the many nominations of <em>Dune</em> after facing anger from leading film-makers over its policy of releasing films in cinemas and on its HBO Max streaming platform simultaneously. As a big box-office hit, the movie's prominence may also stem criticism that the Oscars now mostly reward films little seen by audiences.</p> <p>For the Academy, there will be further relief if it avoids a repeat of the controversies around diversity that have beset the awards in recent years. The next step will be to try to restore TV audiences and a general sense of cultural heft. In that respect, some planning detail is still needed. As the Oscars announced their nominations, it was still unknown who — if anyone — will actually host the ceremony on March 27.</p>  <p>The nominees in the four main awards categories are as follows:</p> <h1>Best Picture</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01aff5d2-ad9c-4558-8b8f-5d16e2c04be9\"><em>Belfast</em></a><em><br></em>Kenneth Branagh's autobiographical tale of a Protestant family living through the Troubles in the late 1960s</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec1aa69a-6bd8-41e9-84b1-41b3386749ac\"><em>CODA</em></a><br>Sian Heder's drama about a hearing teenager who is a child of deaf parents</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88ecb5ad-9fff-4142-9e24-d8dd7699eb7e\"><em>Don't Look Up</em></a><br>Adam McKay's satire about an impending global disaster</p> <p><em>Drive My Car</em><br>Japanese drama about a theatre director dealing with loss, regret and <em>Uncle Vanya</em> </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/625f9c2e-c573-41ef-b52e-f37ab390ca93\"><em>Dune</em></a><br>Big-budget adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef1a3fb8-34c5-4029-ae62-0ac54725a83d\"><em>King Richard</em></a><br>Biopic of Venus and Serena Williams' father and coach starring Will Smith</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22e31d10-3051-4bda-a3e7-655882ca1b3d\"><em>Licorice Pizza</em></a><br>Sunny tale of first love in 1970s California by Paul Thomas Anderson</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/384f5eb5-ee9b-45b5-aba0-2cf36375f9e9\"><em>Nightmare Alley</em></a><em><br></em>Guillermo del Toro's 1940s-set film noir about grisly sideshows and bad people</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f2af17e-cad5-4fc6-9ea7-68e5402dda5d\"><em>The Power of the Dog</em></a><br>Jane Campion's story of macho bravado and ambiguous sexuality in the Old West</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb9fc43-0bd8-451d-a405-f55b074d2511\"><em>West Side Story</em></a><br>Steven Spielberg's lavish and faithful adaptation of Sondheim's musical</p> <h1>Best Director</h1> <p>Paul Thomas Anderson, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22e31d10-3051-4bda-a3e7-655882ca1b3d\"><em>Licorice Pizza</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/051f1c1a-34a7-4ced-b441-1a2f809b1c22\">Kenneth Branagh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01aff5d2-ad9c-4558-8b8f-5d16e2c04be9\"><em>Belfast</em></a></p> <p>Jane Campion, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f2af17e-cad5-4fc6-9ea7-68e5402dda5d\"><em>The Power of the Dog</em></a></p> <p>Ryusuke Hamaguchi, <em>Drive My Car</em></p> <p>Steven Spielberg, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb9fc43-0bd8-451d-a405-f55b074d2511\"><em>West Side Story</em></a></p> <h1>Best Actor</h1> <p>Javier Bardem, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03c4592-8b5d-4519-9c66-1c238a216dfd\"><em>Being the Ricardos</em></a></p> <p>Benedict Cumberbatch, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f2af17e-cad5-4fc6-9ea7-68e5402dda5d\"><em>The Power of the Dog</em></a></p> <p>Andrew Garfield, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4a963ed-95bb-4032-ab5f-581fe23e4dea\"><em>tick, tick . . . BOOM!</em></a></p> <p>Will Smith, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef1a3fb8-34c5-4029-ae62-0ac54725a83d\"><em>King Richard</em></a></p> <p>Denzel Washington, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f33597f7-5f24-465b-acdf-c2025853a356\"><em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em></a></p> <h1>Best Actress</h1> <p>Jessica Chastain, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c69c2e63-9541-4c24-9720-240726613974\"><em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em></a></p> <p>Penélope Cruz, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d6b9da2-12c4-4f9b-96ce-e34ff54ac585\"><em>Parallel Mothers</em></a></p> <p>Nicole Kidman, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03c4592-8b5d-4519-9c66-1c238a216dfd\"><em>Being the Ricardos</em></a></p> <p>Olivia Colman, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e2480f4-4e58-425b-a480-6c29dde257fc\"><em>The Lost Daughter</em></a></p> <p>Kristen Stewart, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e05684d2-9161-4fdd-94cf-7d8f4576ffaa\"><em>Spencer</em></a></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2022 'Oscar nominations 2022: Netflix's The Power of the Dog leads the pack' FT.com 8 February.
