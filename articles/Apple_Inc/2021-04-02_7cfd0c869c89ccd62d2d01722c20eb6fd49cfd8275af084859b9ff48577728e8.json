To watch, go to palmbeachdramaworks.org. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Emily Dickinson is not only a great poet but an artistic giant who casts a long shadow across both high and popular American culture. On the one hand, her hauntingly gnomic verses formed the basis for \"Letter to the World\" (1940), one of Martha Graham's very best dances, and Aaron Copland's \"Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson,\" a song cycle of supreme sublimity. On the other hand, she cavorts wildly and ahistorically throughout \"Dickinson,\" the Apple TV+ comedy series in which she is transformed into a kind of proto-goth chick who takes opium and has hot sex with her brother's fiancee. </p><p>\n  \"The Belle of Amherst,\" William Luce's 1976 one-woman play about Dickinson, falls somewhere in between these distant extremes, if far closer to the former than the latter. Solidly stitched together by Luce from her poems and correspondence, it is no masterpiece by any means, but Luce tells the tale of her reclusive life with a proper regard for such verifiable facts as are known, and the result is one of the most commercially successful solo bioplays in the history of the genre. In addition to creating the role on Broadway and subsequently taking it on the road, Julie Harris appeared in a PBS version of the play taped at a 1976 Los Angeles performance, and that telecast (which can be streamed on Amazon Prime) has caused her to be indissolubly identified with part and play alike. While \"The Belle of Amherst\" continues to be performed by regional theater companies all over the U.S. and was revived off Broadway in 2014, nobody ever writes about it without making mention of Harris's delicate, subdued performance, which is widely regarded as definitive. </p><p>\n  You'd think such a play would have been taken up as soon as the Covid-19 pandemic closed American theaters and forced them to resort to streaming video, not least because as a one-hander it presents none of the logistical challenges of an ensemble production. But Palm Beach Dramaworks' new online version of \"The Belle of Amherst,\" starring Margery Lowe, jointly produced with Coral Gables' Actors' Playhouse and taped without an audience in PBD's 218-seat theater, appears to be the first one to be webcast since the start of the lockdown. It is also PBD's first fully staged webcast production, and the company is hoping to make its future shows available online after America's theaters reopen. </p><p>\n  If that comes to pass, \"The Belle of Amherst\" will have made for an auspicious start. Not only is this one of the best theatrical webcasts I've seen in the past year, exactly comparable in artistic quality and production values to Undermain Theatre's \"St. Nicholas\" and the Wilma Theater's \"Heroes of the Fourth Turning,\" but Ms. Lowe's performance is superior in certain important ways to that of Julie Harris. </p><p>\n  Heresy? Perhaps, but Harris's Dickinson was too closely tied to the outmoded view of the poetess (a loaded word I use deliberately in this context) as a tremulous recluse. Ms. Lowe doesn't play her that way at all: Her Dickinson is witty, occasionally peppery and more than a little bit sly. She makes no bones about being amused to think of her puzzled neighbors regarding her as \"Squire Edward Dickinson's half-cracked daughter,\" and you can tell that, like Jane Austen, she has everybody's number. </p><p>\n  William Hayes, PBD's producing artistic director, has staged \"The Belle of Amherst\" in so subtle a way that you never notice his fine directorial hand at work. Everything seems to be emanating straight from Ms. Lowe, though Mr. Hayes clearly played a crucial part in shaping her distinctive interpretation. The in-house design team -- sets by Michael Amico, lighting by Kirk Bookman, costumes by Brian O'Keefe -- has just as clearly gone to infinite trouble to make the show look just the way it should, played out as it is in a simple but comfortable 19th-century Massachusetts home. </p><p>\n  The only thing missing is the warming presence of a live audience. It always comes as a surprise to hear Harris's audience chortling in the 1976 telecast -- she doesn't do much to amuse them -- whereas Ms. Lowe's performance is at times audaciously funny, and it would be lovely to hear a roomful of delighted people responding to her crisp wit. But even if you have no choice but to watch \"The Belle of Amherst\" by yourself, you can be sure that it will both amuse and move you, for Ms. Lowe also has the emotional weight to rise to the dark occasion of the play's final scene, when death's black chariot whose \"Horse's Heads / Were toward Eternity\" pauses to collect her for the final ride from obscurity to immortality. You will not soon forget the way she speaks those familiar lines. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Teachout, the Journal's drama critic, is the author of \"Satchmo at the Waldorf.\" Write to him at tteachout@wsj.com. </p><p></p>",
