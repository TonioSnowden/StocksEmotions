  "title": "Trump Banned From Twitter",
  "text": "<p>Facebook Inc., which also announced a temporary suspension after the riot, said Thursday that it would extend that indefinitely -- and at least through the end of Mr. Trump's term -- and many critics of the president had called on Twitter to take more severe action as well.</p><p>\"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them -- specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter -- we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" Twitter said in a blog post.</p><p>Later Friday, a statement from Mr. Trump was posted in several tweets on the @POTUS Twitter account, an official government account that in the past has been operated by White House staffers and frequently retweeted posts from the president's personal account.</p><p>\"Twitter employees have coordinated with the Democrats and the Radical Left in removing my account from their platform, to silence me -- and YOU, the 75,000,000 great patriots who voted for me,\" the posts said. They added: \"We have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED!\"</p><p>Twitter removed those new tweets from the @POTUS account soon after they were posted, saying the move was consistent with its policy against using other accounts to try to evade a suspension. \"For government accounts, such as @POTUS and @WhiteHouse, we will not suspend those accounts permanently but will take action to limit their use,\" a Twitter representative said.</p><p>The actions by Twitter and Facebook shut off two of the largest megaphones Mr. Trump has relied on for years to communicate with the public, and raise further questions over the role social media plays in regulating controversial content on their platforms. Mr. Trump had more than 88 million followers on Twitter and more than 35 million on Facebook.</p><p>Conservatives have long complained that the social-media platforms' actions to label or remove posts they deem dangerous, abusive, or misleading amounted to censorship disproportionately applied to those on the right. Some of them have promoted alternatives with far less-stringent content rules, including Parler, a free-speech focused social-media network favored by the right.</p><p>In the wake of Wednesday's attacks, though, many have expressed alarm at the role tech platforms played in spreading Mr. Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the presidential election was stolen, and angry calls by his followers to take action in response.</p><p>Alphabet Inc.'s Google late Friday suspended Parler from its smartphone app store, and Apple Inc. threatened to do the same. Google said it acted because of \"continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the U.S.,\" which violated its requirements for sufficient moderation of egregious content for apps it distributes. \"In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app's listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues,\" a Google representative said.</p><p>Apple, citing similar concerns, said Parler has to provide it with detailed information about its content-moderation plans and \"what you will do to improve moderation and content filtering your service for this kind of objectionable content going forward,\" according to a notice provided to The Wall Street Journal by John Matze, Parler's chief executive. Apple set a deadline of 24 hours for Parler's compliance.</p><p>Mr. Matze said that Parler believes its existing rules against incitements to violence meet Apple's standards and that the company is confident that \"we can retain our values and make Apple happy quickly.\" Nonetheless, Mr. Matze said, he was nervous \"because the text in their messaging was fairly confrontational.\"</p><p>Other social-media companies placed indefinite bans on Mr. Trump this week including Snapchat parent Snap Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.'s Twitch. A Snap spokeswoman said Thursday the president's account was locked indefinitely because the company \"will not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice.\"</p><p>Mr. Trump had tweeted three times since regaining account access Thursday. In his first post, he tweeted a video condemning the violence at the Capitol and acknowledging that a new administration would be inaugurated Jan. 20, without specifically naming President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.</p><p>On Friday he posted a tweet saying \"The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\" Then later, he said in a tweet that he would not be going to the inauguration.</p><p>Twitter said it issued the ban in response to the Friday tweets, saying after assessing the president's language that it determined the posts violated its glorification of violence policy. Due to ongoing tensions, the company's blog post said, \"these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President's statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks.\"</p><p>Mr. Trump's tweets and photo were no longer visible on Twitter as of Friday evening, replaced with a message saying \"Account suspended . . . Twitter suspends accounts which violate the Twitter Rules,\" and linking to its policies.</p><p>Twitter also earlier Friday shut off the accounts of Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to Mr. Trump, and Sidney Powell, a lawyer who worked alongside Mr. Trump's legal team before the campaign distanced itself from her in November. The company also said that it suspended several accounts associated with the far-right conspiracy group QAnon.</p><p>Social-media companies have for years grappled with how to handle and whether to moderate content from Mr. Trump, with those efforts growing in the run-up to and after the 2020 presidential election. Those decisions to label or remove content from Mr. Trump such as those making unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud have been welcomed by critics but included calls to take stronger measures.</p><p>---</p><p>Catherine Lucey, Jeff Horwitz and Tim Higgins contributed to this article.</p>",
