  "text": "<p>MY WIFE, a farmer, grows organic vegetables—acres of them—which she sells through a CSA program. Right around this time of year, her clients start to get overwhelmed with produce. They'll ask what to do with all the carrots and beets and kohlrabi busting out of their produce drawers. The answer is always: Make pickles. The reaction to this advice tends to be abject intimidation. For some reason, lots of people don't know how easy it is to pickle a vegetable. I'm here to tell you: It's easy.</p><p>There are two basic ways to pickle vegetables: via the quick-pickle method, which is easy; and via the lacto-fermentation method, which is even easier.</p><p>Let's start with the quick-pickle method. Step one, choose your vegetable. Onions are a classic for this method, but any veggie will work. Peel or cut the vegetable into the shape you want it to be—in our onion example, this would be slices—and place in a container. Next pick a vinegar. Any type will work, technically speaking, but balsamic would make weird pickles, so try apple cider vinegar or just plain old distilled white vinegar. Cut the vinegar with water in a 1-to-1 ratio. Then, for every cup of liquid add 2 teaspoons of salt. If you want a slightly sweet pickle add the same amount of sugar. Heat this mixture until the salt is dissolved. Pour the brine over your veggies. Wait half an hour or more. That's it. Keep your quick pickles in the fridge and pull them out whenever you have a burger, as a condiment. They add nice zip to salads, too.</p><p>Though the lacto-fermentation method is, as I've said, even easier, people fear it. They'll ask if they need any milk. No, not that kind of lacto. In this method, you harness the power of lactic acid bacteria by creating a brine salty enough to prevent any other bacteria (or mold) from surviving. You've been eating lacto-fermented pickles your whole life. Kosher dill pickles are a famous example. So is sauerkraut.</p><p>For a salty-enough lacto-ferment brine you need 1 teaspoon of salt for every cup of water, which you can heat to help the salt dissolve faster. Let that brine cool, pour it over your vegetables, cover and leave at room temperature. Then, you wait until the vegetable is sour to your liking. This could take 3 or 4 days, but it could be longer if you like sour pickles. Keep tasting every day to know how far the sour has progressed. Once the pickles taste the way you want, put them in the fridge to stop the bacteria's acid production.</p><p>Once you start pickling vegetables it's easy to fall down a briny rabbit hole. If this happens to you there are some fantastic resources available to the home lacto-fermenter. One is \"The Noma Guide to Fermentation\" by René Redzepi and David Zilber. The chapter on lacto-fermentation does an excellent job of breaking down the science into layperson speak. The choice of ingredients is sometimes a little out-there, but it illustrates that anything can be preserved this way. Another great book is Sandor Ellix Katz's \"The Art of Fermentation,\" an epic compendium of the knowledge of controlled rot.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your favorite thing to pickle? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Either the quick or lacto method will yield a bonus ingredient that is often just poured down the drain. The brines themselves take on the character of the vegetables they cure and make wonderful additions to sauces, vinaigrettes and soups. The lacto-fermented brines will have additional complexity from the fermentation. Before you toss any brine, give a thought to how you might want to use it instead.</p><p>On our farm there is a walk-in cooler with a section where my name is written on tape on the wall. Under it are crates and crates of leftover vegetables. I will spend many summer weeks just making pickles to be sold in the winter months. It's one of the easiest parts of my job. The salt, vinegar and bacteria do all the work.</p><p>How to Make Pickles the Easy (And Even Easier) Way: Recipes and Tips</p>",
