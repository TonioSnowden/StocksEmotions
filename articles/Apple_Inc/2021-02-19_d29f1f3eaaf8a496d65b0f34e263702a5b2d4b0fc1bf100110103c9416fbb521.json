  "text": "<p>On Thursday, February 25, designers Raf Simons and Miuccia Prada will present their first Autumn/Winter womenswear collection as co-creative directors of the Prada label. It's their third overall, since their collaboration began officially in April last year. But they haven't been in a room together since January, and even then, only briefly. </p> <p>Thanks to Covid-19, the pair have had to power through the first year of their high-profile partnership largely via Zoom meetings, video fittings and old-fashioned telephone calls. Miuccia Prada is based in central Milan; Simons moved into a Milanese villa in June, and now divides his time between the Italian fashion capital and Antwerp, where his namesake label is based.</p> <p>“I think that, actually we are working together more and more,” says Prada, who turns 72 this year. She's talking via Zoom, from a room upholstered in green velvet. Behind her hang major artworks — a fluffy Achrome by Piero Manzoni, and John Baldessari's “Box (Blind Fate and Culture)” from 1987. </p> <p>She did work with Simons, in the flesh, through July and September last year, which was important, both say. “But now, we really started to work together, in a much more deep way,” she says. “Basically, we, on every single subject, every single thing, we talk.”</p> <p>“We had much more time for this one — the first [collection] was very compressed,” Simons, 53, says when we talk separately three days later from a room in Prada's headquarters in via Bergamo. He's speaking of Prada's Autumn/Winter womenswear show, which will be filmed later in the week. As with almost all fashion shows for this season, it will be shown without a live audience. The designs are secret — fabrics have been hidden, clothes are out of sight.</p> <p>The designers concede that this collection has some congruence with the January menswear show, which at the time they stated was about “the human body, and its freedom” expressed through form-fitting, clinging knitted bodysuits in jacquard, and cocooning coats in leather and bouclé tweed. This new iteration, Simons says, will be pushed further. “They've become more exuberant,” he says of the clothes. “They are materialised now in a way that they have more Prada DNA.” He promises it's a hardcore vision. “You know, Miuccia is an extremist,” he smiles. “And I love it.”&#xa0;</p> <p>If it's tricky to get the two in a room together, it's trickier still to wrap your head around the situation in the first place: two of fashion's most influential figures, collaborating on a single line. It's the industry equivalent of Pollock and Picasso deciding to get together and paint on the same canvas.</p> <p>These are two designers that have shifted modern fashion. When Prada launched clothing under her family's leather goods label in 1987, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbb1613a-7f6d-4381-aa1b-f4f76f349c1f\">her aesthetic had a seismic impact</a>: she helped define late 20th-century minimalism, while her clothes explored arresting, even outrageous ideas of sincerity, banality and even “bad taste” previously more akin to contemporary art than fashion. She continues to innovate, and her output has helped shape the work of subsequent generations of designers, including Simons himself.</p> <p>He started his menswear label in 1995, fundamentally affecting the silhouette of menswear not once, but twice — first, shrinking it down in skinny black suits, then oversizing it with layers of sweatshirts and bomber jackets. Both are still enormously influential, and referenced.</p> <p>A decade later, in 2005, Simons designed his first womenswear collection for the Milan-based Jil Sander label — an appointment made by Prada and her husband, Prada chief executive Patrizio Bertelli, as the Sander label was then part of the Prada Group. Simons' work showed new facets to his talent, namely his skills as a colourist, expanded in his subsequent, shortlived but critically acclaimed tenures at Christian Dior and Calvin Klein. His name is referenced in pop songs — one, by the American hip hop collective ASAP Mob, is actually titled “Raf”. </p> <p>Prada Group is, of course, not only a creative powerhouse but a commercial juggernaut, with total net revenues of €3.2bn in 2019. It was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3dd2ba8-6df0-4dcb-bd55-25ec246bdbc0\">battered by the waves of store closures</a> during last year's lockdowns, but rebounded in the second half, allowing the group to reach positive pre-tax earnings for 2020.</p> <p>The group comprises not only Prada, but the brands Carshoe, Church's and Prada's sister label Miu Miu, of which Miuccia Prada remains sole creative director. I wonder if this collaboration has changed her perception of that brand? “Somehow, yes, actually,” she says. “Before, I could have half of me in one place, half of me in the other one. Now, all myself, it is in Miu Miu. That should be good for Miu Miu.”</p> <p>Since 2014, Prada has also been co-chief executive of the group alongside her husband. Both she and Simons are often perceived as detached from business, yet their perspectives are strong: they are creatives, first, foremost, but not only.</p> <p>“I understand that responsibility,” says Simons, of business needs — indeed, he has helmed his own brand independently for over a quarter century. Responsibility is also the word Prada uses. “We are a company, with thousands of people working for us,” she says. “We have to sell. We are not here to have fun. Creative people in fashion — we are not pure artists. We have to be responsible, because companies and enterprises should be responsible. There's a responsibility to your workers, about sustainability, about inclusivity. And not only responsible, but contributing to change.” Which is precisely what they are doing, in every sense.</p> <p>As the date for their Autumn/Winter show nears, their first collection, for Spring/Summer 2021, has begun to trickle into stores. Its style was precise — minimal, maybe — with combinations of graphic pattern and text-based prints that literally layered Prada's aesthetic with Simons'. The models clutched simple, rectangular wraps around their shoulders, pared back in design but often lustrous in material — duchesse satin, chiné taffeta, one strewn with appliqué flowers. The Prada logo, an enamelled isosceles triangle originally used on its nylon backpacks, inspired triangle tongues on slingback shoes, pyramidal bags, and was a symbol used in prints. It was swirled into a rosette on short silk dresses; in the menswear, it appeared as one of those jacquard knits.</p> <p>“Raf is obsessed with the triangle,” Prada says. Simons views it very directly: “We have to be honest — right now it is a thing in fashion. The way things are labelled. I'd rather search for things to make clear what the brand is, without putting a 40 centimetre ‘Prada' — a literal word — on the garment.” He pauses. “I'm fascinated by how certain literal Prada things — like the Prada logo — can be brought into what I call the architecture of the garments. A logo jacquard, a negative space, cut out, a rosette. Instead of just putting the metal triangle on it. I understand how important it is, that something has the signal of a brand. But I would prefer to be a little more original.”</p> <p>Contemporary fashion is dominated by logoed and sloganed designer sportswear, loudly messaging designer affiliation and conspicuous consumption. Neither Prada nor Simons are ignorant to the fact that that triangle is, of course, a logo — quieter than a brand name, but just as persuasive as a badge of identity. That connects with streetwear and youth culture. Simons is obsessed with the latter, and his work has contributed much to the former. </p> <p>The triangle also suggests the insignia or crest of a uniform, the latter being something Prada adores, and has often explored. She dressed in clothes bought in school outfitters and uniform shops before she began making clothes under the Prada label; and for Simons, uniforms represent the communities he is fascinated by. He dedicated a 1998 collection to the style of Kraftwerk, the most “uniformed” band of all-time.</p> <p>“Those are all thoughts that he brought in,” Prada says. “The idea of community. The idea of defining Prada, which I think is very welcome. I think, in this moment of confusion, you have to be more precise. You have to be more direct in what you want to say. I think it's very, very important to define what the purpose of Prada is; what are the things that really matter to Prada, in this moment.” </p> <p>It also, perhaps, helps for Prada to have a fresh perspective. “When you are in your brand — you view the DNA differently than someone from outside,” Simons says when I ask him about the process of defining Prada. “We talk about it in the way that I am not there as the designer, but that I am there as the audience. I try to put myself often in that position. I am the audience. We are both critical, of our own work, of each other's work, of other people's work. Which I think is important, to push things further.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Speaking of the audience, there were some that suggested the first collection contained more Raf-isms than Prada-isms. Neither Prada nor Simons seem overtly bruised by those critiques. “Here and there you read it: it's too Raf,” says Simons himself. “We are quite flabbergasted if we read things like that, because that's also the reason, partly, while I'm here. But it's what Miuccia wants.”</p> <p>“Sometimes it's said that there is more Raf than me,” says Prada. “OK, maybe. But I like the idea because otherwise, why would I have called him? If I wanted to stay myself — <em>basta</em>. I am happy to have him and his ideas, absolutely, to open up to his ideas because this is what I wanted — to enlarge the vision.”</p> <p>“I don't see it as me, or as Prada,” Simons says. “It's two things coming together. But what we do is Prada, because it is <em>at</em> Prada.”</p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
