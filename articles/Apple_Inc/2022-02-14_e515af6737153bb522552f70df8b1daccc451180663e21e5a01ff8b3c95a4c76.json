  "text": "<p>When a candidate can't recall their own name in a job interview, it isn't usually a good sign. Yet when a young woman struggles to answer, her evaluator tells her instead that she has achieved a “perfect score” and is given a job on the spot. Unsurprisingly, the position comes with a catch. </p> <p>Apple TV Plus's cerebral alternate-reality thriller&#xa0;<em>Severance</em>&#xa0;is set at Lumon Industries, a mysterious company where a number of new employees have been fitted with a brain implant which essentially creates two distinct minds in one body. On entering the office each day, the implant disconnects staff from their personal identities and memories, allowing them to go about their arcane assignments with commitment and discretion, totally oblivious to the world outside. </p> <p>But when they exit the building every evening, the process is reversed and the individual is restored to their usual mental state, unaware of anything that happened during their time inside. While the so-called “outie” version of a&#xa0;“severed” person earns a salary without every being conscious of paying their dues, for their “innie” version, life at Lumon is tantamount to a stay at Hotel California: they may check out at the day's end, but they never have the experience of leaving.</p> <p>It's an innovative premise that raises phenomenological, existential and ethical quandaries even in synopsis form. And over nine episodes, <em>Severance </em>is not afraid to take its time delving into the complexities of selfhood and reality, while providing a sardonic image of corporate culture where people are encouraged to lose themselves in their work. </p> <p>Series creator Dan Erickson is mindful not to let the show become a protracted thought experiment. Philosophical conundrums are integrated into a plot full of intrigue and given a human face via the employees in Lumon's Macrodata Refining department. Among them is new hire Helly (Britt Lower), who struggles to come to terms with her identity as a living avatar for her “outie”, and the dandyish Irving (John Turturro), who later begins a strangely touching relationship with Christopher Walken's Burt.</p> <p>At the heart of the show is Mark (Adam Scott), recently promoted to department head by his ever-observing supervisor (Patricia Arquette). His “outie” is the only one we encounter at first; a cheery devoted grafter by day, Mark is a lugubrious alcoholic by night who joined Lumon so that he could forget about his wife's death for eight hours a day. An unwanted link between his two lives emerges when he's approached by a former colleague who has had their memories “reintegrated” and can reveal all the sinister goings-on at Lumon. </p> <p>Although the series is careful to balance these bleaker elements of the story with moments of absurdist humour, it's unlikely that anyone would recognise that most of the episodes were directed by the comedian Ben Stiller. So adept is the <em>Zoolander</em> star at developing an unsettling tone that you might just wonder if he was severed from the memory of his past work.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>Episodes 1 and 2 on Apple TV Plus from February 18; new episodes released weekly thereafter</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Severance on Apple TV Plus is a brilliant alternate-reality thriller ' FT.com 14 February.
