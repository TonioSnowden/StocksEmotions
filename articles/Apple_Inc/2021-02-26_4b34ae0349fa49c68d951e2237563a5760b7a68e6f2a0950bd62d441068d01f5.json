  "text": "<p>It has not been an easy few years for Venice. In November 2019, Italy declared a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4571dd94-06e9-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd\">state of emergency</a> after the city was hit by its worst flooding in 50 years, leading to two deaths and an estimated €1bn of damage. Then came the pandemic.</p> <p>“We were just about recovering by carnival in February 2020 when Covid arrived,” says Simone Venturini, the city's deputy mayor for social welfare, tourism and development. “The tourist economy was completely eliminated.”</p> <p>Venice now finds itself at a crossroads. With estimates suggesting that visitor figures for 2020 were only a fifth of the usual, and with short-let landlords looking to offload properties or return them to longer-term leases, a permanent population previously priced out and put off by the crowds is contemplating a return.</p> <p>In December, the number of Venice listings on Airbnb and Vrbo was 23 per cent lower than in December 2019, according to AirDNA, which tracks the short-term rental market; year-on-year, bookings in the city were down 74 per cent. Jamie Lane, vice-president of research for the analytics platform, believes that it's possible the city won't see a return to pre-pandemic levels as properties revert to long-term housing.</p> <p>The impact on rents and sale prices could be significant. Normally, the number of short-term rentals in a city comprises about 1 or 2 per cent of homes, says Lane. According to University of Siena researchers, that figure in Venice is closer to 12 per cent.</p> <p>Before the pandemic, the average property price in Venice was declining, from €4,500 per sq metre in 2018 to €4,341 in 2019, according to Engel &amp; Völkers. Full-year data for 2020 is not released yet. According to Amy Redfern-Woods, an associate at estate agent Knight Frank, some short-term rental investors have sold their properties because, without the income from tourists, they were unable to keep up with mortgage repayments.</p> <p>And there may be more to come. “It will take some time before tourists can return in the numbers of 2018-19,” says Giacomo Argenio, sales director at estate agent Engel &amp; Völkers Venice. “Many other properties currently used as Airbnbs will arrive on the [sales] market.”</p> <p>Over the past decade, the demand for short-term accommodation increased rental prices and squeezed-out locals. “For people who cannot afford to buy a property it was just impossible,” says Marco Gasparinetti, spokesman for Gruppo 25 Aprile, a residents' rights campaign in the city.</p> <p>With the impact of Covid-19, however, that may be about to change. There are now 8,000 vacant premises that could be converted into low-cost housing or workspaces, according to Gasparinetti. He says that landlords have already started offering former Airbnb properties with contracts measured in years, rather than weeks or months.</p> <p>The chance to stabilise the dwindling number of permanent residents would be long overdue. Before the pandemic, the population of the city was about 50,000, less than a third of what it was in the 1950s.</p> <p>Cruise ships and day trippers make the exact number of visitors difficult to track, but an Airbnb report from 2018 suggests that for every local there are 74 tourists.</p> <p>Asking rental prices in some of the city's central areas have fallen sharply since the pandemic, according to real estate website Immobiliare.it. In the area surrounding Dorsoduro, the average monthly rental price per sq metre in January was down 16 per cent year-on-year, from €18.90 to €15.80 — as the number of listings increased by 164 per cent. In the area around San Polo — where the number of listings rose 286 per cent — the average rental price fell 12 per cent to €15.30 per sq metre. </p> <p>Claudia Gentilcore is one of those seizing the opportunity presented by the pandemic. This week, the 33-year-old nurse moved to the city from Ferrara, 50 miles south-west of Venice, after viewing a rental property online.</p> <p>Her budget of €400 to €450 a month would not have covered higher-priced short-term lets, but was more than enough for the flatshare she soon found — in a “typical Venetian home” in Dorsoduro — with Gruppo 25 Aprile's help.</p> <p>Perhaps in anticipation of the reopening of its many museums and galleries, interest in the Dorsoduro neighbourhood has been high, according to Serena Bombassei, owner and managing director of Venice Real Estate. “[It] is a very trendy and sought-after area, generally loved by artists and designers as well as locals,” she says. The relative calm has been a draw. “I imagine the tourists will return, but not in the numbers there were before,” says Gentilcore.</p> <p>Interest is rising across the city, according to Knight Frank, which reports a 24 per cent rise in inquiries in 2020 compared with the year before. Demand has been driven by Brexit, the Venetian lifestyle and a wish to escape from larger cities during the pandemic. “Many [buyers] had a prior affinity with Venice, and the art, fashion and culture scene,” says Redfern-Woods. For the very wealthy, there's also the appeal of the Italian flat-tax regime, offering foreigners a rate of €100,000 on all income made outside of Italy.</p> <p>If Venice does transform from a tourist hotspot to a more liveable city, then it will not be the first time it has had to reinvent itself. When the Republic of Venice fell to Napoleon in 1797, the city was no longer the capital of a state which at its height extended beyond the Adriatic coast as far as Crete and Cyprus. Civil servants, diplomats, merchants and soldiers left in droves as the city's population almost halved from 170,000 at the height of the republic to 96,000 at the turn of the 18th century.</p> <p>Writer Jan Morris quotes one observer who witnessed the decline. “The English use their [gun] powder for their cannon, the French for their mortars. In Venice it is usually damp, and if it is dry they use it for fireworks.”</p> <p>The city's revival centred around this spirit of pageantry, not least in the carnival, which under normal circumstances would have brought millions of revellers to the city streets this month; instead, Venice saw carefully policed restrictions on public gatherings and a rather more mundane selection of masks. Celebrations for the 1600th anniversary of the founding of the city, due to take place in March, will also have to be more muted.</p> <p>As a port city, Venice has always suffered disproportionately when it comes to plagues: an epidemic in the 15th century reduced its population by two-thirds, with a further third killed in the plague of 1576. The Lazzaretto Vecchio, founded in 1423 and still standing beside the Lido, was the first quarantine station of its kind in the world.</p> <p>Fast-forward to 2021 and Covid-19 has prompted another existential crisis for the city's economic model. Few believe it can survive entirely without tourism, but a return to the crowds seen pre-pandemic seems unthinkable.</p> <p>“We must decide what kind of tourism we want,” says Gruppo 25 Aprile's Gasparinetti. “Do we want millions of day trippers, or smaller numbers of people who want to stay in Venice?”</p> <p>Venturini is more pragmatic. He says: “Venice needs tourism, and tourism isn't as ugly a word as some might insinuate.” He says that only a change in national law can limit the spread of short-term rentals, and the council is campaigning for such a reform.</p> <p>Despite the economic impact on the city, the lack of tourists over the past year has come with some welcome environmental benefits. Air pollution has decreased, and the reduction in water traffic has led to clearer canals as the sediment at the bottom is left untouched. Along with the quieter streets, it makes for an inviting picture for prospective residents.</p> <p>“The environment clearly benefited to an extent which is just unbelievable,” says Gasparinetti. “When Venice is overcrowded, it is no longer the same kind of experience.”</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
