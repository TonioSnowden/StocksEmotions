  "text": "<p>   Regarding your editorial \"The Progressive Purge Begins\" (Jan. 11): President Xi Jinping of the Chinese Communist Party shuts down Google, Facebook and Twitter in China, blocking information to 1.4 billion people. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey closes the sitting president's account, blocking information to his 88 million direct followers plus countless others via redistribution. Amazon blocks books based on their authors' political viewpoint. Google and Apple block Parler. Twitter blocked the New York Post, though they later relented. What master are they serving? </p><p>   Has House Speaker Nancy Pelosi considered that President Trump's 88 million Twitter followers is a larger group than the 81 million-plus Joe Biden voters? </p><p>   Bill Ragsdale </p><p>   Woodland, Calif. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   You raise the issue of websites being forced to host content they disagree with. However, the editorial fails to mention how this unethical government involvement would violate the First Amendment. </p><p>   This is exactly why Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which allows websites to host the content of others without assuming the liability, must be protected. Section 230 remains one of the best tools in America's arsenal against dangerous content and using it as a political tool to cajole tech to the short-term whims of politicians would be nothing short of a disaster. </p><p>   Repealing Section 230 would force websites to either hypermoderate, decimating the ability of everyday Americans to share their news and views online, or not moderate at all and let dangerous content stay up. While there will never be consensus over the specific actions taken by the larger social-media websites, removing their ability to engage in reasonable moderation isn't the right path forward. </p><p>   Doing so would blindly hurt both progressives and conservatives all the while, ironically, undermining our culture of free speech and expression. </p><p>   Carl Szabo </p><p>   Washington </p><p>   Mr. Szabo is general counsel for NetChoice, a trade association. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   I find it interesting that you've chosen to interpret recent actions by social-media and technology companies as a \"progressive purge.\" Another view is that these private companies are doing exactly what they believe is in the best interest of their corporations and their shareholders. Surely chaos and social disorder aren't a satisfactory business model. To the extent that their business activity facilitates this disorder, it is entirely appropriate that they eliminate their participation -- capitalism at its best. </p><p>   James L. Naughton </p><p>   Sausalito, Calif. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   There is a lot of blame to go around for inflaming emotions which caused the riot at our nation's Capitol. Big Tech's current arbitrary standard for censorship shares the blame. Passions were inflamed by Twitter's blatant attempt to hide the truth in regard to the New York Post's story on Hunter Biden. Twitter stoked the flames as much as President Trump did. </p><p>   In addition, the extreme left got the \"go\" signal this summer regarding riotous behavior. The extreme right heard the message. </p><p>   Virginia Daily </p><p>   Houston </p><p>   --- </p><p>   You have missed the mark entirely. There is no chance, none whatsoever, that the social-media giants will become the government's best friends when it comes to censorship. This is America, not Russia or China. </p><p>   We aren't talking about dissenting opinions here. We are talking about hate mongering, inciting violence, spreading lies and deceptions and opinions without any basis in facts. </p><p>   This kind of rhetoric tears at the very fabric of our country. The overwhelming majority of the people of this country are exceedingly tired of this. We want healing, courtesy, kindness -- not violence. </p><p>   Your citation of the First Amendment is misguided at best, harmful at worst. Taking this kind of hate mongering out of the mainstream should be applauded. It has no place in this country. </p><p>   Robert Oristaglio </p><p>   Boynton Beach, Fla. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Imagine a scenario in which water and electric utilities stop delivering their services to businesses or consumers whose opinions they disagree with. The social-media and tech companies are doing the same, as we speak. Congress needs to condemn and legislate a stop to this behavior, not support it. </p><p>   Bruce Morrison </p><p>   Indianapolis </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Unilaterally dumping an entire political world view forces the radicals to look for attention elsewhere, if they can't scream in public in plain sight. It raises the question of whether Twitter is now inciting people to violence by imposing a draconian silence on 74 million people and expecting that to be the end of it. Marginalized groups (American conservatives) with no way to meaningfully engage in widespread communications will find other avenues to become relevant. </p><p>   I believe this act by Twitter, et al., did nothing to dial back the superheated political environment. I believe it rapidly advanced plans by radicals to make a big noise the only other way they can. They were making noise online by shouting, mostly to each other. With no voice, they still have to scream. So how do you think they'll get attention? </p><p>   Frank Carroll </p><p>   Pueblo West, Colo. </p><p></p>",
