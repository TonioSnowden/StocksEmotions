  "text": "<p>Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the cinema, Omicron has appeared like an unwanted sequel, bringing with it another few months of uncertainty. Looking ahead, however, there are plenty of appetising upcoming releases — from blockbusters to streamers, veteran auteurs to indie favourites — to keep us hoping that cinemas will remain open and schedules on track. In that spirit, here are 10 films to look forward to in 2022. </p> <h2>The Worst Person in the World </h2> <p>Norwegian director Joachim Trier's comedy-drama was universally lauded by critics at this year's Cannes Film Festival, with the FT calling it a “refreshing, bittersweet romcom”. While the charmingly carefree, 30-going-on-16 female lead is a tired schtick in romantic comedies, here the main character of Julie is imbued with a self-awareness and textured humanity as she struggles to make decisive choices in love and work. Renate Reinsve gives a revelatory performance that saw her pick up the Best Actress prize in Cannes. <br><em>Scheduled release date March&#xa0;25</em></p> <h2>The Northman</h2> <p>The latest from Robert Eggers, director of acclaimed indie horrors <em>The Witch</em> and <em>The Lighthouse</em>, follows a young Nordic prince seeking to avenge his father's death at the hands of his uncle. If that sounds familiar, it's because this is a retelling of the medieval Scandinavian myth of <em>Amleth</em>. Eggers will be operating on epic scale, but a fjordful of eerie, unsettling scenes can still be expected. No amount of muddy, bloody battles can remove all the glitz from a cast that includes Alexander Skarsgard, Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe and Anya Taylor-Joy. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<br><em>Scheduled release date April 22</em></p> <h2>Top Gun: Maverick</h2> <p>The <em>Top Gun</em> sequel has been grounded so many times since it was announced that the trailer released in 2019 is starting to look almost as vintage as the original 1986 movie. And, suspiciously, Tom Cruise still looks the same age. Despite having single-handedly defeated the Russians in his last outing as Maverick, we find the ace pilot now working as a lowly instructor; among his new class is the son of his former co-pilot, Goose, whose death still haunts him. Confronted with this gosling (Miles Teller), Maverick realises that even flying at supersonic speed doesn't let you escape the past.<br><em>Scheduled release date May 27</em></p> <h2>Elvis</h2> <p>Such is the fandom surrounding the King that if Baz Luhrmann gets this biopic as wrong as he did 2013's wildly misjudged <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, he might find himself accused of <em>lèse majesté</em>. As far as casting goes, Austin Butler certainly looks the part, while Tom Hanks seems a sound choice to play the role of Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's hugely influential manager. Their relationship is the main focus of the film, which will chronicle the singer's precipitous rise and fall. If nothing else, Luhrmann can be trusted to deliver a first-rate soundtrack. <br><em>Scheduled release date June 24</em>&#xa0;</p> <h2>Don't Worry Darling</h2> <p>Eyebrows may be raised at the casting of former One Direction singer Harry Styles in a psychosexual thriller, but tickets will definitely be bought. Having revitalised the high school comedy with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d1a1efe-7c98-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560\"><em>Booksmart</em></a>, Olivia Wilde returns with an update of the erotic thrillers of yesteryear for a new generation who, she believes, too rarely get to see <em>la petite mort</em> on le big screen. The story itself takes place in the 1950s and follows a young married couple (Styles and Florence Pugh) as they begin life in a utopian commune that, <em>quelle surprise</em>, is actually more of a dystopia. <br><em>Scheduled release date September 23</em></p> <h2>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&#xa0;</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80e567d8-dd47-4cad-b738-fe72e4e8153d\">Chadwick Boseman</a> has given some terrific, intense performances in smaller-scale dramas, but he is best remembered for his turn as the eponymous Black Panther in Marvel's 2018 film, which brought urgent discussions about race to a blockbuster. His untimely death last year means that this follow-up will be as much defined by his absence as the abundance of colossal-budget action and detailed world-building. Little is known in terms of plot for the sequel, but its box office appeal can already be taken as a given. <br><em>Scheduled release date November 11</em></p> <h2>She Said</h2> <p>It is a sad irony that the story of how the grassroots #MeToo movement became the sociopolitical force it is today has been somewhat occluded by the spectacular downfalls of the high-profile men it helped bring to justice. A new film by Maria Schrader, director of the Netflix series <em>Unorthodox</em>, will put the spotlight on the two Pulitzer-winning New York Times investigative journalists, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey (played by Zoe Kazan and Carey Mulligan), whose work brought to light dozens of sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. <br><em>Scheduled US release date November 18</em></p> <h2>The Fabelmans</h2> <p>Steven Spielberg has told nearly every kind of story there is to tell, but one has so far eluded him: his own. His latest feature (co-written with Tony Kushner) will serve as a fictionalised portrait of the film-maker as a young man, following his upbringing in Arizona and his cinematic awakening as an adolescent. Michelle Williams, Paul Dano and Seth Rogen star as the director's parents and uncle respectively, while newcomer Gabriel LaBelle bears the responsibility of giving us a glimpse of Spielberg's precocious genius.<br><em>Scheduled US release date November 23</em></p> <h2>Killers of the Flower Moon </h2> <p>Martin Scorsese is practically synonymous with New York, from its seedy criminal underbelly to its resplendent upper crust. But now, with more than 60 credits to his name, he has finally decided to saddle up and go West. Still, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> is less about cowboys than the atrocities that befell the oil-rich native Osage tribe in Oklahoma in the 1920s, and the nascent FBI's investigations into the spate of murders. Two of Scorsese's great leading men, Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, combine forces in what will be a real statement release from rising streaming service Apple TV Plus. <br><em>Release date to be announced</em><br>&#xa0;</p> <h2>White Noise</h2> <p>There have already been numerous failed attempts to adapt Don DeLillo's idiosyncratic and exquisitely mordant 1985 novel. But if anyone can tackle the tale of a dysfunctional family of fatalistic, anxious, world-weary intellectuals it's surely Noah Baumbach. That said, the hyper-specificity of DeLillo's prose and the shagginess of his plotting make this the director's most ambitious project yet. Broadly, it is a meditation on death that centres around an academic after his exposure to radiation during an “airborne toxic event”. He is played by Adam Driver, apparently continuing his campaign to appear in everything.<br><em>Release date to be announced</em></p> <p><em>All dates are subject to change</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2021 'Films in 2022: Elvis, the women who stopped Weinstein and a Scorsese Western' FT.com 29 December.
