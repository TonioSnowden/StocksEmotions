  "text": "<p>Investors are worried that lackluster results so far in technology companies' earnings could be a sign that an economic slowdown could be on the horizon.</p><p>Facebook parent Meta Platforms posted its second revenue decline in a row after markets closed Wednesday. The social-media company is battling a host of challenges, including a tough macroeconomic climate, growing competition and the fallout from Apple's ad-tracking changes, all of which have taken a toll on its advertising business. Shares plunged 22% premarket.</p><p>Google reported its fifth consecutive quarter of slowing sales growth earlier this week, with its YouTube video platform posting a drop in advertising revenue for the first time since the company began reporting the unit's performance.</p><p>\"Some of the tech earnings have been very disappointing,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. Advertising has historically been seen as a bellwether for how the economy is doing, he said, with the decline in that part of earnings \"suggesting the economy is slowing.\"</p><p>Shares of Honeywell International gained 4.9% premarket after the conglomerate housing aerospace, materials and other businesses raised its full-year profit forecast. Caterpillar posted a 21% increase in third-quarter sales as demand for its construction and other heavy equipment held up as it raised prices. Shares rose 4.2% premarket.</p><p>Southwest Airlines shares added 3.8% premarket after the carrier reported third-quarter profit that beat expectations. McDonald's shares gained 2.5% premarket after the fast-food giant exceeded analysts' expectations for the third quarter.</p><p>Intel, Amazon.com, Apple and T-Mobile US will post results after the market close.</p><p>Data from the Commerce Department showed that the U.S. economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the third quarter, snapping two quarters of contraction. Durable goods orders rose 0.4% in September from the previous month, and new figures showed that 217,000 workers filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 22, up slightly from the week prior.</p><p>Investors are also awaiting a Federal Reserve meeting next week where officials are expected to deliver another interest-rate rise of 0.75 percentage point. Some officials have begun signaling their desire both to slow down the pace of increases soon and to stop raising rates early next year to see how their moves this year are slowing the economy. Others have said it is too soon for those discussions due to elevated inflation.</p><p>\"Globally, the Fed's tightening is working through many different channels and there is a slight concern that these things affect the real economy with a lag and the Fed is overcooking it,\" Mr. Mackay said, though he doubts that the economy is slowing fast enough to stop officials from raising rates further.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 4.053% from 4.014% Wednesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies, added 0.5%.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 0.8% to trade at $94.59 a barrel.</p><p>Twitter shares edged up 1.1% premarket. Banks have started to send $13 billion in cash backing Mr. Musk's takeover of Twitter, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.4%. Credit Suisse shares tumbled almost 14% in Swiss trading. The bank said it would raise $4 billion in fresh capital from a Saudi Arabian bank and other investors to fund a retreat from Wall Street and recover from a near-existential crisis.</p><p>The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage point Thursday. The central bank also said it expects to raise interest rates further as it works to damp inflation.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed with mixed performance. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.7%. China's Shanghai Composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.6% and 03%, respectively.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Mixed Ahead of Tech Earnings</p>",
