  "title": "Business News:  Ex-Facebook Workers Push to Fix Sector  ---  Onetime employees  launch startups in an  effort to overhaul  social-media industry  ----  By Deepa Seetharaman",
  "text": "<p>   Elon Musk isn't the only entrepreneur with big ideas about how to fix social media. </p><p>   A number of startups are emerging to challenge the status quo. Many are rooted in their founders' experiences within Facebook's parent, now known as Meta Platforms Inc. </p><p>   Nearly a decade ago, then-WhatsApp executive Neeraj Arora helped negotiate the $22 billion sale of the messaging startup to Facebook. </p><p>   But once at Facebook, Mr. Arora says he soured on the company's reliance on online advertising and saw its leadership as overly fixated on competition and rapid growth rather than improving core products. \"They didn't build with the user in mind,\" said Mr. Arora, who left in 2018. </p><p>   Now Mr. Arora and Michael Donohue, also formerly of WhatsApp, are tackling social media again, with their startup HalloApp. This time, Messrs. Arora and Donohue say they aren't focused on maximizing how much time people spend on their app or prodding users to expand their online networks to attract advertisers. </p><p>   Instead of ads, HalloApp plans to charge subscription fees, likely a dollar or two and less than $5 a month. Groups inside the app are capped at 50 people. \"You don't want to lose the plot by growing too quickly,\" Mr. Arora said in one of several recent interviews. </p><p>   HalloApp -- which raised $15 million from investors including Sequoia Capital, former Facebook board director Jim Breyer, WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton and others -- is one of several startups that are aiming to solve the problems of social media. </p><p>   Some startups say product design should be considered as much as the content decisions that generate more headlines. At HalloApp, they believe capping the size of groups will help minimize the potential for abuse. Right-leaning platforms like Parler and Truth Social argue that people need fewer content rules so as to speak freely to the masses without worrying about censorship. Other companies argue for a combination of stronger content policies and design choices so political discussions become more civil. </p><p>   Last month, Mr. Musk, waded into the fray and offered to buy Twitter Inc. for $44 billion, in part so he could relax its content rules and promote free speech. </p><p>   This competitive pressure comes as Meta confronts an unprecedented series of challenges. Its ad business is taking a beating after Apple Inc. limited its ability to collect data and the stock price fell sharply this year. </p><p>   \"We've always faced stiff competition and that's a good thing. It forces us to innovate, create better experiences for people, and focus on making the best products in the world,\" a spokesman said. </p><p>   He said the company is investing heavily in so-called community messaging, building tools that make it easier to connect with small groups of family and friends. </p><p>   Any company tackling social media faces challenges breaking into an industry that hasn't produced a bootstrapped success story in years. But many of those trying to reimagine social media today say their small size is exactly the point. </p><p>   \"The era of a few big winners is ending,\" said Eli Pariser, co-director of New Public, a nonprofit trying to create online spaces to foster healthy conversations. \"Consumer tastes are changing. The one-size-fits-all approach -- they're seeing how much that's breaking down.\" </p><p>   Mr. Pariser said the nonprofit's model is built on the premise that people are more likely to hold each other accountable in smaller, more intimate forums and become more familiar with different views. The new co-director of his initiative to tackle this problem is Deepti Doshi, who spent seven years at Facebook. </p><p>   Many of those founders who came from Facebook now say they believe the company's size came to be a liability. Some are removing growth-friendly features like friending or following that have long been the bread-and-butter of mainstream social-media sites. </p><p>   \"I think scale is problem number one,\" said Rob Ennals, a former product manager at Facebook. \"All these things fall apart when things get too big.\" </p><p>   In online spaces, groups are often dominated by the most prolific members, who post so much that it drowns out the quieter, more moderate voices, Mr. Ennals says. </p><p>   Mr. Ennals, who left Facebook in 2018, created a service called Talkwell to overhaul the way public debates take place online. On Talkwell, which is in testing, a user's posts are organized behind their user icon, no matter how often they post. This design, theoretically, makes it hard for any one individual to take over a discussion. \"You don't miss the quiet people,\" he said. </p><p>   Central to HalloApp's appeal is its lack of reliance on advertising, its founders say. Users can only connect with people in their address book. Posts disappear after 30 days. Messages are encrypted by default. HalloApp's design won't stop \"your crazy uncle from sharing disinformation,\" Mr. Donohue said, but because the networks are smaller than Facebook and it is harder to share, he believes the effects will be minimized. </p><p>   In 2018, WhatsApp was implicated in violent attacks in India, a fact that took Mr. Arora and other executives by surprise. The events prompted the service to put a cap on how often information can be forwarded and how large WhatsApp groups can be. </p><p>   Those events and others, he says, created a different climate around social media today. \"Even five years ago, if you had asked me about disinformation, I would have said, 'Are you stupid? Who cares about these things?'\" Mr. Arora said. \"We're building on a different planet.\" </p><p></p>",
