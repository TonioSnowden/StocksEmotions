  "text": "<p>Some Americans were stuck at home with partners and family, counting their steps on iPhones AAPL, and wondering whatever happened to those online yoga and fitness classes. While others were alone, worrying about their next paycheck.</p><p>This column reflected those struggles: Inflation, rising house prices, uncertainty surrounding a highly volatile stock market, politically polarized families, credit-card bills, and a rather privileged question about a $30,000 bracelet.</p><p>The variety of subjects begs the question: Is the Moneyist a financial column about relationships — or a relationship column about money? Judging by the most popular letters of 2021, an argument could be made that it's both.</p><p>In 2020, there were hundreds of questions about stimulus checks. In 2021, during the second year of the pandemic, people expressed “compassion fatigue” and vented their frustration about vaccination requirements.</p><p>One man wrote of his parents: “They refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Did I do the right thing?</p><p>My wife makes $200K a year, but gives us $700 a month, and $3,000 to her brother and mother ‘to keep them in the good life'</p><p>‘I'm a man of simple pleasures': I live with my girlfriend, 59, who owns several homes and has saved $3 million. I pay utilities, and do repairs. Is that enough?</p><p>My daughter no longer speaks to me or my husband, and mocked our family values. Do we cut her out of her $2 million inheritance?</p><p>My husband and I bought our late neighbor's foreclosed home. My stepdaughter moved in — then the problems began</p><p>My ex-wife passed away. I'm the beneficiary on her life insurance. Her family wants me to pay her funeral expenses and won't leave me alone</p><p>My father desperately begged me, ‘Son, get a lawyer. That woman is going to take away your inheritance!' My stepmother kept $1 million after he died</p><p>My girlfriend cosigned my mortgage. I paid the mortgage for 4 years, plus a $125,000 down payment. She paid the utilities.
