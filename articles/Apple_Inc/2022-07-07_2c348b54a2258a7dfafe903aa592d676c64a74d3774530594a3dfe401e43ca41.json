  "title": "Samsung Electronics' String Of Record Results to End",
  "text": "<p>Samsung benefited from pandemic-era shifts and government stimulus that created a huge appetite for the company's memory chips, smartphones and televisions. But demand across the tech industry is beginning to fall from those levels, as consumers trim spending as the costs of many essential items soar.</p><p>Samsung reports full results later this month. It expects second-quarter operating profit of 14 trillion South Korean won, roughly equivalent to $10.7 billion, for the quarter ended June 30. That compares with 12.6 trillion won a year earlier. Revenue is forecast at 77 trillion won, up from 63.7 trillion won, the company said.</p><p>Analysts polled by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence were on average expecting 14.6 trillion won in operating profit and 76.9 trillion won in revenue.</p><p>For the opening months of 2022, Samsung posted its highest-ever quarterly revenue, of 77.8 trillion won, while operating profit grew by 50%. The company's shares have fallen roughly 28% since the start of this year.</p><p>Samsung, the world's No. 1 maker of semiconductors and smartphones, is considered a tech-industry bellwether as it is an electronics maker and a component supplier to rivals like Apple Inc.</p><p>Led by memory chips, the company's semiconductor business -- which accounted for more than half of its annual operating profit in 2021 -- has enjoyed a sales boom throughout the pandemic. Its memory-chip business lost some pricing power in recent months, though it was able to offset those declines with increased shipments, said Sanjeev Rana, a senior analyst at CLSA.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
