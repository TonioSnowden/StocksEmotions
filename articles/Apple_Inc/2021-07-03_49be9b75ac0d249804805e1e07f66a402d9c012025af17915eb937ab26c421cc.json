  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Friday's Markets:  U.S. Stock Indexes Rally to Fresh Highs  ---  Employment report  sends S&P to seventh  straight record, led by  technology shares  ----  By Michael Wursthorn and Caitlin Ostroff",
  "text": "<p>   Major U.S. stock indexes climbed Friday, notching a trio of fresh highs as an early summer rally picked up steam. </p><p>   After the monthly employment report confirmed that the U.S. economy continued to recover at a healthy clip, the S&amp;P 500 added 32.40 points, or 0.8%, to 4352.34, setting a seventh consecutive record, its longest watermark streak since mid-1997. </p><p>   Technology stocks led the gains, pushing the Nasdaq up 116.95 points, or 0.8%, to 14639.33, also setting a record. As Friday's upswing broadened out, the Dow joined the rally, advancing 152.82 points, or 0.4%, to 34786.35, hitting its first closing high since early May. </p><p>   The action wrapped up another solid week of gains. The Nasdaq rose 1.9% over the last five trading days, posting its sixth weekly advance out of the last seven. The S&amp;P 500's historic run added 1.7% this week, and the Dow gained 1%. </p><p>   Friday's jobs report added to the good news cheering on markets. Employers added 850,000 jobs last month, topping expectations and showing a pickup in labor-market activity after it appeared to somewhat cool in previous months. </p><p>   For investors, the gains were further evidence that the economic recovery remains intact and doesn't currently warrant a tightening of fiscal stimulus, so far fulfilling predictions by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. </p><p>   \"From a market perspective, this was an all-out positive jobs report,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"While the stronger-than-expected payroll number signals a continued buoyant recovery, the rise in unemployment rate suggests some slack in the market and, therefore, hopefully some respite for the Fed hawks.\" </p><p>   She added: \"The 'will they, won't they' Fed question still stands, but at least today's number isn't triggering major navel gazing.\" </p><p>   Mr. Powell, over the past month, has sought to put investors at ease by saying he expects economic growth to accelerate as the year wears on and that any threats from inflation would prove temporary. </p><p>   His comments have helped usher in the growth-stock recovery, with Friday's report juicing shares of those companies further. </p><p>   But the data also foreshadowed potential problems in the labor market that could roil markets later on this year. Wages grew as businesses paid up to attract employees, with the June report showing a 2.3% month-over-month increase in nonsupervisory workers' average hourly earnings in the leisure and hospitality industries. </p><p>   Don Calcagni, chief investment officer at $31 billion money manager Mercer Advisors, said those workers have the highest propensity to spend, which could end up pushing inflation higher, especially if employers feel the need to increase wages further. So far, that doesn't seem to be a major issue as more workers look for job, Mr. Calcagni said. </p><p>   If inflation gets out of control, analysts predict the Fed would have to seriously consider an interest-rate rise sooner rather than later, renewing the pressure on growth stocks. </p><p>   \"That's a little bit of a canary in the coal mine,\" added Mr. Calcagni. </p><p>   For now, investors continued to put inflation concerns on the back burner. </p><p>   They bought growth stocks in the tech, consumer discretionary and communications sectors, and sold some cyclical stocks. </p><p>   Tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 added 1.4%, while shares of consumer discretionary and communications rose 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively. Among the gainers, Alphabet shares climbed $56.26, or 2.3%, to $2,505.15, while Apple rose $2.69, or 2%, to $139.96. </p><p>   Energy and financial stocks in the broad index declined 0.2% each. Meme stocks also traded lower, with AMC Entertainment Holdings slipping $2.26, or 4.2%, to $51.96. </p><p>   Shares of ride-hailing giant Didi Global fell 87 cents, or 5.3%, to $15.53 after it was blocked from adding new users as China's internet regulator reviews its cybersecurity. </p><p>   Outside the U.S., the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.2% over the week despite gaining 0.3% on Friday. In China, stocks mostly fell, a day after the country commemorated the 100th anniversary of China's Communist Party. </p><p>   The CSI 300 index, which tracks the largest stocks listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen, fell 2.8%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 1.8%. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Chong Koh Ping contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
