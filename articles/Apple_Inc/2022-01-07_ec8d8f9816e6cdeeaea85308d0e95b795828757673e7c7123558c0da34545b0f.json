  "title": "Samsung Forecasts 52% Rise in Quarterly Operating Profit  ----  By Jiyoung Sohn",
  "text": "<p>   SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. is forecasting a roughly 52% jump in its fourth-quarter operating profit from a year earlier, lifted by demand for memory chips and improved returns from its contract chip-making business. </p><p>   The world's largest smartphone and memory-chip maker expects operating profit of about 13.8 trillion South Korean won, equivalent to about $11.4 billion, for the quarter. That compares with about 9.05 trillion won a year earlier. </p><p>   The estimate is below market expectations, but the electronics maker said the results reflect a one-time bonus paid to employees. </p><p>   The company estimates it generated 76 trillion won in sales, roughly a 24% gain from a year earlier and a quarterly record for the company. </p><p>   Samsung's top-line boost reflects strength for chip makers that have enjoyed elevated demand during a long-lasting supply crunch. The company is considered a bellwether for the tech world as it is both a major electronics maker and components supplier to big tech firms including Apple Inc. and Sony Group Corp. </p><p>   Samsung and many other chip makers have seen their revenue jump, as a pandemic-fueled surge in demand for all sorts of devices requiring semiconductors has created widespread shortages and a run-up in prices. </p><p>   Analysts polled by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence on average expected the company to post about 15.2 trillion won in operating profit and 75 trillion won in revenue. Samsung is due to report full earnings later this month. </p><p>   Shares in Samsung rose 1.3% in early Friday trading in South Korea. </p><p>   Prices of memory chips -- both DRAM and NAND flash -- were expected to drop in the final three months of last year, as the global semiconductor shortage stalls the assembly of various tech products requiring memory. </p><p>   But profit held up, as the price decline was smaller than expected due to robust demand for server memory chips in particular, coupled with the gradual easing of the chip shortage, said CW Chung, head of Asia technology research at Nomura Holdings Inc. </p><p>   Fourth-quarter prices of DRAM are projected to have fallen as much as 8% from the prior quarter, while the same prices of NAND flash are expected to have decreased by up to 5%, according to TrendForce, a Taiwan-based market researcher. </p><p>   Memory prices are expected to fall further in the first half of this year, though temporary production adjustments at Samsung's memory manufacturing facilities in Xi'an, China, recently hit by Covid-19 lockdowns, may help temper the decline, according to analysts. </p><p></p>",
