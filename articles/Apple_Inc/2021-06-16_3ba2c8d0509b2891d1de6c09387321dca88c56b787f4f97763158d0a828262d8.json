  "text": "<p><em>Hi, this is Kenji. Tech has no doubt made our lives easier and more convenient, but it has also raised various problems that are inflicting pain on people. Online sex crime is becoming rampant across the region, including where I live in Hong Kong, but it is especially severe in South Korea (The Big Story). Some workers at Chinese tech companies are complaining about the harsh conditions in their workplaces (Mercedes' top 10). G7 leaders are making serious motions in the fight against Chinese tech to protect democratic values, but I wish they would do their homework (Our Take). Please take good care of yourself.</em>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Was this email forwarded to you?

(FT)</p></li> </ol> <h2>Our take</h2> <p>The G7 gathering last weekend in Cornwall could be remembered as the first tech-driven summit. The 25-page <a href=\"https://www.g7uk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carbis-Bay-G7-Summit-Communique-PDF-430KB-25-pages-5.pdf\">communiqué</a> issued at the end of the meeting contained more than 30 references to the words technology and technological — a stark difference from two years ago, when the leaders last met face-to-face in Biarritz, France.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The way tech was referred to was distinct, as well. In Biarritz, the word appeared a few times in some auxiliary statements, including on digital transformation in Africa, but the rest were mainly passing remarks.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>In the Cornwall document, the potential of a technological transformation was discussed “in accordance with our shared values”, and the use and evolution of new technologies were linked to “shared democratic values and commitment to open and competitive markets, strong safeguards including for human rights and fundamental freedoms”. On data-driven technologies, the leaders emphasised “data free flow with trust”, while they vowed to secure “transparent and sustainable and diverse digital, telecoms and ICT infrastructure supply chains”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unlike matters regarding Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the South and East China Seas, these references to tech were not explicit but were quite obviously pointed at Beijing. The free world leaders pledged to collectively challenge “non-market policies and practices”, but they also need to act to nurture innovations at home and enhance their own tech competitiveness in order to compete against real technological challenges emerging in China.&#xa0;</p> <p>— Kenji&#xa0;</p> <h2>Smart data</h2> <p>The number of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03ffc8b8-7846-41ee-9364-7f30ee9cadb4\">venture deals</a> in China rose 56 per cent in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier, the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing activity, as start-ups pulled in Rmb354bn ($55bn) in investment, according to data provider ITjuzi. </p> <p>The chart above lists the main investors in Chinese start-ups last year. <strong>Tencent</strong> was particularly active, and is cashing in some gains as its listed portfolio expands. VC firms such as <strong>GGV Capital</strong>, <strong>Qiming Venture Partners</strong> and <strong>Matrix Partners China</strong> raised large new funds, suggesting that their investments will remain strong in the quarters to come.</p> <p>“The capital winter [in China] is over, competition for deals is fierce,” said Ming Liao of Prospect Avenue Capital. “You need to bring something to the table more than just cash to get into deals now.” </p> <h2>Spotlight</h2> <p>Since founding <strong>Shein</strong> in 2008, <strong>Chris Xu</strong> has made the company a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b87df56a-cb71-4b6a-8c36-6e2db9a52c7c\">global Gen Z staple</a> known for selling cheap, on-trend clothing online.</p> <p>In May, the company reached the top of the app download charts for shopping on both <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>'s stores, while it was valued at $15bn in its most recent known funding round in August 2020.</p> <p>But now Shein is facing complaints from apparel brands that claim it has infringed their intellectual property. </p> <p>AirWair International, the makers of the iconic Dr Martens boot, is suing Shein over what it described in court filings as a “clear intent to sell counterfeits”, pointing to a “Martin boot” listed on the site. Kikay, a Los Angeles-based direct-to-consumer earring brand, said it was alerted to its designs being sold on Shein by one of its customers this month. </p> <h2>When sages speak</h2> <ul>  <li><p><a href=\"https://merics.org/en/ccps-next-century-expanding-economic-control-digital-governance-and-national-security\">This tour-de-force</a> from Merics, a Berlin-based think-tank, has a really good section on tech and governance in China.

A useful and detailed study.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Art of the deal</h2> <p>Wind and solar power plant operator <strong>China Three Gorges Renewables</strong> raised $3.53bn in a <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/IPO/Three-Gorges-Renewables-soars-in-China-s-biggest-IPO-in-17-months\">blockbuster IPO</a> last week in Shanghai. The company's stock price rose the maximum 44 per cent allowed on debut. </p> <p>The company, which is a unit of the operator of the world's largest hydroelectric power plant, capitalised on investor interest in China's drive to realise President Xi Jinping's pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.</p> <p>As of September 30, CTG Renewables owned 11,890 megawatts of domestic power generating capacity. Of that, 58 per cent was wind, 40 per cent solar and the rest hydropower. This gave CTG Renewables a roughly 3 per cent share of domestic wind power production and more than 2 per cent of solar capacity.</p><p>Source: Kenji Kawase and James Kynge in Hong Kong 2021 'South Korea becomes a global centre for digital sex crimes' FT.com 16 June.
