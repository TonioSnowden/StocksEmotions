  "title": "Russia's Ruling Party Leading in Elections as Putin Looks to Tighten Grip; Russian leader wants to reassure allies his position remains firm amid an antagonistic relationship with the West",
  "text": "<p>Since Russia has a mixed voting system, where half the seats are assigned to individual candidates while the other half are elected directly from party lists, those early results would be enough for United Russia to hold on to the majority of all seats.</p><p>It remained to be seen whether United Russia, which held 334 of the 450 seats in the outgoing parliament, would garner the two-thirds majority needed to enact changes to the constitution. Mr. Putin helped found United Russia and still supports it, although he isn't a formal member.</p><p>The race to control the Duma comes as Mr. Putin, who has sought to reassert Russia as a geopolitical power, attempts to reassure allies that his position remains firm amid an antagonistic relationship with the West.</p><p>Tensions between the U.S. and Russia remain high despite a summit in June between President Biden and his Russian counterpart. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on a number of government and business leaders close to Mr. Putin in punishment for what Washington says was Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>Mr. Putin needs a parliament that will support his domestic and international policies and will back any decision he makes to extend his time in power beyond his current term, which expires in 2024. United Russia's previous majority allowed Mr. Putin to easily push through constitutional reforms that give him the option of remaining in power for another 12 years.</p><p>\"It's comfortable\" for Mr. Putin if United Russia remains in control, said Evgeny Minchenko, president of an independent political studies agency in Moscow. \"About 70% of the laws that go through the parliament are not made by members of parliament, but by the government and the administration of the president,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties, independent observers and activists reported incidents of vote tampering, including ballot stuffing and pressure on employees in state-owned companies to vote. Ella Pamfilova, the head of Russia's Central Election Commission, said on Sunday there were 12 cases of ballot-stuffing and the agency had invalidated around 8,500 ballots, a number that could rise, according to the state news agency, RIA Novosti.</p><p>Ms. Pamfilova said voting violations were lower compared to previous elections and Russia's electoral system was \"one of the most, if not the most transparent in the world,\" the TASS state news agency reported.</p><p>The vote included six gubernatorial races and three heads of regional republics.</p><p>The results of Sunday's election appeared to show that the non-systemic opposition, most notably that led by the jailed dissident and Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny, is no longer a credible challenge, analysts said.</p><p>For Mr. Putin, maintaining support of Russian citizens remains key. Polls show that Russians are widely unhappy with falling living standards, collapsing infrastructure and rising inflation.</p><p>In Tver, a city of nearly half a million people around 100 miles northwest of Moscow, the country's stark polarization was on display. United Russia voters prefer the stability and predictability offered by the ruling party, while opponents say they want better living conditions and are fed up with increasing limits on personal freedoms, such as increasing internet censorship and a crackdown on independent media and antigovernment dissent.</p><p>\"The ruling party is disgusting,\" said Alexander Barashkov, 47, who cast his ballot for an opposition candidate and complained about low salaries and rising prices.</p><p>\"They've been in power for many years yet there are no changes—things are actually getting worse and worse,\" said Mr. Barashkov, who works for a state-owned energy company.</p><p>Under a system known as managed democracy, in which Russians are largely allowed to vote and voice their opinions but are mostly powerless to change public policy, Mr. Putin has managed to contain any dissent that could challenge his rule.</p><p>Although a poll earlier this month by the state public-opinion research center VCIOM showed that just 29% of Russians were ready to vote for United Russia, Mr. Putin's traditional voting bloc of pensioners, law enforcement and the military likely supported the party out of loyalty to the longtime leader, analysts said.</p><p>Russians feel that \"maybe we don't like many of these people, but we trust you so much that we are even ready to vote for [them],\" said Sergey Markov, the pro-Kremlin director of the Institute for Political Studies in Moscow.</p><p>At a polling station across the Volga River in Tver, Yuri Reshetov, an 86-year old pensioner, cast his ballot for United Russia.</p><p>\"I want my children and grandchildren to live a life without shocks, in a stable country,\" Mr. Reshetov said as Soviet-era music blared around him.</p><p>\"Putin is the best and only person who can be president, he took the country out of the ditch, I wish him good health,\" he said. \"I'm afraid to think who will be next.\"</p><p>Nina Mikhailovna, 70, concurred, scorning the opposition and calling Mr. Navalny \"a thief, a swindler, a traitor to the Motherland.\"</p><p>Vitaly Dmitrievich, 67, said he voted for the communists not because he likes the party but because they sometimes challenge United Russia.</p><p>He complained that he wouldn't be able to survive on his $230 monthly pension if not for support from his son and he criticized some of the infrastructure failings in Tver.</p><p>\"I'm driving along our potholed roads and all I do is swear,\" he said. \"It's the same as it was a hundred years ago.\"</p><p>Ahead of the election, Mr. Navalny's supporters were detained or fled into exile, fearing arrest. Several opposition groups and independent media were outlawed as extremists or foreign agents, prohibiting them from running for office. Mr. Navalny was jailed earlier this year for violating parole hearings that he said he missed because he was recuperating in Berlin following a poisoning attack. Western officials have blamed the Kremlin for that attack.</p><p>\"We have seen unprecedented pressure,\" said Ruslan Shaveddinov, a member of Mr. Navalny's team. \"We see how they are pressing from all sides, blocking all our resources and using criminal cases. Each member of our team has gone through multiple searches and administrative arrests and all my colleagues are involved in fabricated criminal cases,\" he said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think the election results in Russia will affect the U.S.-Russia relationship? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The dissident's team had continued to push the strategy that it calls smart voting, which urges Russians to cast ballots for the strongest antigovernment candidate in each electoral district in an effort to detract support of the ruling party—a tactic shunned by some supporters of sanctioned opposition parties.</p><p>The smart voting website was deemed illegal and banned, and on Friday the app meant to coordinate the activity became inaccessible on Apple and Google app stores. Russia's state censor had accused U.S. tech giants of meddling in the vote by providing a platform for Mr. Navalny.</p><p>His team criticized the tech companies action, but had held out hope that some voters would still use smart voting.</p><p>Adel Demidova, a 21-year-old advertising student who has grown up under Mr. Putin and the ruling party, said she cast her ballot for an antigovernment candidate recommended by the app.</p><p>\"It seems to me that in a democracy, there should be opposition,\" she said. \"Without it, we're going nowhere.\"</p><p>Write to Ann M.
