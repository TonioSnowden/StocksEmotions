  "title": "World News:  Volkswagen, Honda Suspend Some China Production  ----  By Selina Cheng",
  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- Auto makers in China including Volkswagen AG and Honda Motor Co. have halted production at some plants as authorities persist in using strict measures to control Covid-19 outbreaks. </p><p>   Volkswagen has suspended production at its Chengdu plant in southwestern China as well as two of five production lines at its plant in the northeastern city of Changchun since early last week, as a result of car-parts shortages and local health-protection measures, a spokesman said. </p><p>   Toyota Motor Corp. is also adjusting production at some of its factories in China because of Covid-19 disruptions, spokesman Tomoki Yoshida said. </p><p>   Honda's automotive plant in Wuhan in central China partially resumed production on Wednesday after closing for two days because many workers were locked down, spokesman Atsuki Hina said. A Honda factory in Chongqing that produces lawn mowers and generator engines has halted production since Nov. 10 because of a Covid-19 outbreak, he said. The car maker is starting to see disruption in its supply chain, though the scale is still limited, he said. </p><p>   The production halts are the latest examples of economic costs from Beijing's continued rigid Covid-19 curbs and underscore how supply-chain disruptions are bubbling up yet again in China. Under China's zero-Covid policy and repeated lockdowns, factories are cutting back on output while worker and student protests have spread in the country. </p><p>   At the world's largest iPhone factory in central China, run by Foxconn Technology Group, a Covid-19 outbreak that started in October resulted in thousands of workers fleeing and violent clashes between workers and police. Apple Inc. said in November that shipments of its high-end iPhone models would be lower than expected because of the disruptions. </p><p>   This year, the car industry suffered from supply-chain disruptions in China, when automotive hubs such as Shanghai and parts of the northeastern province of Jilin were locked down for months. </p><p>   The number of Covid-19 infections reported by China's health authorities has reached almost 40,000 a day recently, with the most serious outbreaks in Guangdong, Beijing and Chongqing. </p><p>   In Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, Chinese electric-vehicle startup Xpeng Inc. has been operating its plant in a closed-loop setup, a spokeswoman said -- which means largely keeping the site shut off from the outside world and allowing workers to only move between their lodgings and the production lines. Xpeng is also experiencing a component shortage that has affected vehicle production, she said. </p><p>   Some multinational companies are concerned about economic fallout from the latest protests. Protests could spread and \"that could impact various industries -- first and foremost, that could hit the supply chain yet again,\" Kengo Sakurada, the chairman of Japan Association of Corporate Executives, a major Japanese business lobby, said this week. </p><p>   Companies are also reviewing their sourcing reliance on China. </p><p>   Airbus SE, the world's biggest plane maker, is assessing how to dual-source products it buys from Chinese suppliers amid logistical challenges caused by China's zero-Covid policy as well as heightened political tensions between China and the West, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said. </p><p>   China's Covid lockdowns are affecting Airbus's local suppliers further down its supply chain and weighing on the plane maker's ability to deliver aircraft on time, Mr. Faury said Tuesday. </p><p>   Indexes that gauge activity in China's manufacturing, services and construction industries dropped more than expected in November, data released Wednesday showed. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   River Davis and Benjamin Katz contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
