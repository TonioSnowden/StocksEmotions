  "text": "<p>Union is an actor, author and producer. Her most recent book is You Got Anything Stronger?</p><p>Mark Cuban</p><p>\"Influence isn't just broadcasting; it's also consumption. I always try to be a consumer of information from the things that I put out there. There are different types of influence: There's industry influence, there's company influence, and then there's social media influence, and they're all three different. When you're on a social media platform, like Twitter, that's different than Instagram, that's different than TikTok, than LinkedIn, because each one of them has its own audience, and each one of them has its own level of not only nuance, but also nuisance. My approach, if you look at my blog, if you look at even how I tweet, I always try to end it with 'Tell me where I'm wrong.' Or I'll just say, 'Thoughts?' When you're trying to convey influence, when you have an audience of millions, you can become a stronger influencer by learning from your audience.\"</p><p>Cuban is an entrepreneurial investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team.</p><p>Eva Longoria</p><p>\"When I was 28, 29, I went to a photo shoot at Smashbox Studios [in L.A.]. Usually, you get there, and Madonna is shooting in one studio and Salma Hayek in the other, and I remember pulling in and there were, I kid you not, 100 paparazzi climbing over the fence. I said, 'Oh, my God, I wonder who's here? I bet you it's Madonna. Or Cher or Bon Jovi.' And the lady goes, 'It's you.' I came into fame very late in life. I already had a strong hold of who I was. The media—and social media now—defines you, and they tell you who you are. America's Sweetheart. America's Bad Girl. I was already too set in who I was to be defined by anybody. I come from a very philanthropic family, so even before I had a platform or voice, I was involved in charity and volunteerism. Once I became quote-unquote famous, I realized the spotlight I had and how I could redirect that.\"</p><p>Longoria is an actor, a producer, a director and a co-founder of Casa del Sol Tequila.</p><p>Karl Ove Knausgaard</p><p>\"When I tried to write throughout my 20s, I was really looking for my voice and my own style. I was very impressed by Salman Rushdie for a while. Later it was Thomas Bernhard. Then I read Marcel Proust when I was 24, 25. Then two years pass, maybe three, and my first novel [Out of the World] came out, and I had no idea, but it is so influenced by Proust in the way of thinking [about] literature and the way of thinking [about] metaphor, the way of thinking of memory. It was just coming into me, and it came out in a very weird way as my own. I read a lot of philosophy, forget all about it, then I later see, Oh, it's in [my books]. That's an ideal thing, because it somehow enters your way of thinking and directs you in certain ways, and you take what you need. In writing, for me, it's very important not to know where I'm going, not to know anything really.\"</p><p>Knausgaard is a writer. His most recent book is The Morning Star: A Novel.</p><p>Janty Yates</p><p>\"I was a very young and annoying seamstress from 11 onward, and I would make all my own clothes. I went to college and learned how to pattern-cut properly and dress design, but I was really influenced by designers who had their own independence. I wanted to be them. I've been influenced by John Galliano, by Alexander McQueen; I've been influenced by Sir Ridley Scott hugely the past several years. Every project is completely new. [With House of] Gucci, I had to learn so much about Italian fashion. The most wonderful thing was having the opportunity to visit the Gucci archives. I'm fascinated by historical fashion. I really regret not doing history of art at college because I take a huge amount of influence from paintings. My fabric sources really stimulate me. I think if you've got fabulous fabric, you're halfway there.\"</p><p>Yates is a costume designer. Her latest film, House of Gucci, is out November 24.</p><p>Francesco Clark</p><p>\"People are uncovering how easily we can be manipulated. Think about Facebook and Apple, about paid social advertising and people opting out of being tracked on their iPhones. The amount of money that [businesses] were putting into Facebook and Instagram no longer is of as much value as it was before. What that has shown many brands is, Oh, my God, people actually have to like our products at a certain point, but it also shows, Wow, it just so happens that you might think that you are liking this product when in reality you've been targeted on social media. It does shed a light on what it means to be truly influenced. I'm always thinking about, What does the other person want and like? I don't see myself as influential. I look at [influence] as more of the point of view of understanding the other person and connecting with the other person.\"</p><p>Clark is the founder and CEO of the skin-care company Clark's Botanicals.</p><p>These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Mark Cuban and Gabrielle Union on How to Influence People</p>",
