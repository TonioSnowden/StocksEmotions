  "title": "Frank Zappa's Trust Sells Music Catalog to Universal; Deal covers hits spanning four decades including 'Valley Girl' and 'Dancin' Fool,' as well as rights to Zappa's film archive",
  "text": "<p>The transaction marks the latest in a series of catalog- and music-rights acquisitions for Universal, which recently bought Neil Diamond's and Sting's entire song catalogs.</p><p>The latest deal comes as the value of royalty revenue from music rights has soared. Catalogs have sold for as much as 30 times their average annual royalties. Bob Dylan sold his songwriting catalog, which included 600 copyrights over the course of 60 years of music, to Universal in 2020 for between $300 million and $400 million.</p><p>Zappa's and Universal's relationship dates back to 2012, when his family trust and the record label made his entire recorded catalog available in digital formats for the first time, remastering and preparing albums for the streaming era.</p><p>Revenue from streaming music has grown in recent years, thanks to the popularity of services from Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Universal said last year that streaming was still in its early days, with opportunities for further expansion driven by growth in the number of paid subscribers, even in established markets.</p><p>\"As a prolific artist well ahead of his time, Frank Zappa was constantly creating and recording and he left behind a treasure trove of extraordinary still-unreleased music and video in his vault that will help us usher in the next era of Frank Zappa fans,\" said Bruce Resnikoff, chief executive at Universal's globalâ€¯catalog and special markets division.</p><p>The American musician and virtuoso guitarist released more than 60 albums, both as a solo artist and with his band, the Mothers of Invention. His work shifted from the early psychedelic rock beginnings to jazz-rock and satirical.</p><p>He died of prostate cancer in 1993 aged 52 and was posthumously handed the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 1997.</p><p>Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com</p><p>Frank Zappa's Trust Sells Music Catalog to Universal</p>",
