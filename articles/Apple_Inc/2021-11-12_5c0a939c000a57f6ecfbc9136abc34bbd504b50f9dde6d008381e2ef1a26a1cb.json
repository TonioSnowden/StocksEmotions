  "text": "<p>   A Malibu spec house with an Apple Store-inspired glass staircase is listing for $47.5 million. </p><p>   Developed by Kirkor Suri and Bedros Oruncakciel of Malibu Real Estate Investments, the hillside home above Carbon Beach spans about 13,000 square feet on an approximately 22-acre lot, according to Ani Dermenjian of Douglas Elliman, who has the listing with Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency. </p><p>   In addition to five bedrooms, the home has a hair salon, massage room, fitness center, spa, steam room and sauna. There is a billiards room with a wine dispenser, a poker room ventilated for cigar smoking, a 1,000-bottle wine room, a cinema and four indoor fireplaces. The house is being sold furnished, including books, wine and dishes, said Ms. Dermenjian. </p><p>   Outside, the grounds include an infinity pool, Jacuzzi, rooftop deck, terraces with fire pits, a one-bedroom guesthouse and a man-made beach area. </p><p>   The house was designed around views of the Santa Monica Bay and Malibu Pier, said the project's architect, Douglas W. Burdge of Burdge Architects. </p><p>   But the focal point of the home is the two-story glass staircase, built by Italian manufacturer Siller Treppen, Ms. Dermenjian said. The staircase was inspired by the one at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in Manhattan, according to Mr. Suri, who said he had always wanted to include something similar in one of his projects. </p><p>   Malibu Real Estate Investments purchased the land for $7.9 million in 2011, began construction in 2018 and completed the house last month, said Mr. Suri. It is the second of four homes they are developing on Carbon Beach Terrace, perched on the hills above Pacific Coast Highway. The first home was most recently listed for $49.995 million before being taken off the market. He declined to disclose the cost of the current project, but said they spent $4.5 million on concrete rail fencing and $175,000 on the closest in the primary bedroom suite. </p><p>   Malibu saw a record-breaking $177 million sale last week. The late developer-turned-philanthropist Eli Broad's Malibu mansion sold for $52 million in June. </p><p>   Malibu had 9.5% fewer homes on the market in the third quarter compared with the same time last year, and the average single-family home sold for almost $4.5 million, up almost 12% compared with the third quarter of 2020, according to a report by Douglas Elliman. </p><p></p>",
