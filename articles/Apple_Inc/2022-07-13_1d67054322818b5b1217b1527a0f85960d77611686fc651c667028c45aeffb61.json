  "text": "<p>Billionaire Len Blavatnik's sport streaming company DAZN is in talks to acquire smaller rival Eleven Sports, according to people with knowledge of the details.</p> <p>The negotiations show DAZN's determination to acquire content and move into new markets at a time of stiff competition between streaming groups to broadcast live sports that will attract and retain subscribers.</p> <p>Eleven Sports was founded by Italian entrepreneur and Leeds United Football Club owner Andrea Radrizzani. The business consists of live sports streaming, documentary maker Neo Studios and a digital marketing entity called Team Whistle.</p> <p>Eleven has accumulated an eclectic mix of sports rights including rights to show Formula One in Poland, and the Uefa Champions League and the next three seasons of the English Premier League in Portugal. </p> <p>It also owns its own streaming technology following its acquisition of technology provider MyCujoo in 2020.</p> <p>The acquisition of Team Whistle last year created a business with revenues of more than $300mn in the year to the end of June 2021. Radrizzani founded Eleven in 2015 after selling sports rights agency MP &amp; Silva to a Chinese buyer for more than $1bn. </p> <p>Although the DAZN talks are advanced, there is no guarantee that a deal will happen. This year, US media group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d7f4598-4f7d-4a08-a7ed-e76b494dbdd7\">Discovery hijacked DAZN's bid to acquire BT Sport</a>, which owns the UK rights to show English Premier League and Uefa Champions League football. DAZN said that buying BT Sport would have been “uneconomical”.</p> <p>DAZN and Eleven declined to comment. </p> <p>DAZN is aiming to pick up sports rights in an increasingly competitive market where tech groups Amazon and Apple and broadcasters such as NBC, Sky and Disney-owned ESPN are also looking to buy.</p> <p>It already owns the domestic media rights to Spain's La Liga, the German Bundesliga and Italy's Serie A football leagues, and screens sports ranging from football to boxing — but it remains lossmaking.</p> <p>Blavatnik's Access Industries agreed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cc8db53-d326-4ec0-b05a-d91358bf2212\">$4.3bn recapitalisation of the business</a> in February this year, clearing the company's debt as it strives to become profitable and diversify into new revenue streams besides subscriptions. </p> <p>Under chief executive Shay Segev, former boss of gambling group Entain, it hopes to build a betting business and a marketplace for digital collectibles.</p><p>Source: Samuel Agini and Arash Massoudi 2022 'Len Blavatnik's streaming group DAZN in talks to buy rival Eleven Sports ' FT.com 13 July.
