  "text": "<h1>Philippe Laffont: from ‘repressed computer scientist' to top tech investor</h1> <p>As a teenager, <strong>Philippe Laffont</strong> dreamt of working for <strong>Apple</strong> but, after graduating from the <strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</strong>, he was turned down five times by the company in which he would later become a prominent investor. </p> <p>“I'm a repressed mediocre computer scientist,” the now 55-year-old hedge fund manager told me and my colleague <em>Ortenca Aliaj </em>in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36f2376f-8ccb-475c-bcbf-838626b8be78\">wide-ranging interview</a> from his New York headquarters overlooking Central Park. The offices are adorned with various Apple products dating back to 1976 and other once pioneering but now obsolete gadgets. </p> <p>Laffont, a soft-spoken and publicity-shy Frenchman, cut his teeth as a telecommunications research analyst in the late 1990s at renowned investor <strong>Julian Robertson</strong>'s <strong>Tiger Management</strong>. Since striking out on his own in 1999, he has built one of the world's best-known technology-focused hedge funds, and has a growing business investing in private companies. </p> <p>As of May filings, Laffont's <strong>Coatue Management</strong> has grown to more than $70bn in assets since it launched with $50mn in December 1999. Its flagship hedge fund has gained an average of 11 per cent a year since then, compared to 6 per cent for the Nasdaq Composite. </p> <p>But growth investors like Laffont, who seek to identify the handful of companies that can make exponential gains by shaping the future, are facing a reckoning. An era of cheap money has come to an end and they are adapting to a regime change of rising interest rates and high inflation. </p> <p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is down 30 per cent this year. Hedge fund darlings like <strong>Tesla</strong> and <strong>Meta</strong>, both of which sat in Coatue's top-10 holdings as of mid-year, have more than halved in value. And many of Coatue's private investments have not yet been repriced to reflect the substantial declines in public markets. </p> <p>Read the full interview <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36f2376f-8ccb-475c-bcbf-838626b8be78\">here</a>, in which Laffont identifies the tectonic shifts that he thinks will drive the next decade and outlines how the end of cheap money has thrown up a new opportunity: providing funding to cash-strapped businesses. </p> <h1>How FTX ‘accidentally' lost $8bn</h1> <p>It was all an $8bn accident. Or so says <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>. </p> <p>As <strong>FTX</strong>, the crypto business led by the 30-year-old, quickly collapsed earlier this month, many of its employees fled the Bahamas, the Caribbean country where the company was based. Some simply abandoned their cars at the airport. </p> <p>Within the space of a few days, FTX had gone from being the vanguard of a new crypto economy, with a valuation of $32bn and celebrated by celebrities and politicians, to a humiliating bankruptcy. </p> <p>Now the focus of the investigations and legal battles is on the gaps in the crypto exchange's balance sheet — and especially $8bn of missing customer deposits. </p> <p>The most innocent version of events that Bankman-Fried can present is that the missing customer funds were simply an oversight, write my colleagues <em>Joshua Oliver</em>, <em>Nikou Asgari</em> and <em>Kadhim Shubber </em>in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/913ff750-d1f4-486a-9801-e05be20041c1\">this Big Read</a>. The <strong>MIT</strong> graduate, whose signature look combined unkempt hair and scruffy cargo shorts, acknowledged that FTX sent customer money to <strong>Alameda Research</strong>, the private trading firm he also controlled.</p> <p>Bankman-Fried told the FT that the hole in FTX's balance sheet was largely money shifted to Alameda, but that the move took place “accidentally”. (In a document shared with investors shortly before bankruptcy, the funds were listed as being in a “hidden, poorly internally labelled ‘fiat@' account”.) </p> <p>Many will find this explanation impossible to believe. A class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of investors in the US on Wednesday alleged FTX was “truly a house of cards, a Ponzi scheme where [FTX] shuffled customer funds between their opaque affiliated entities”. </p> <p>Interviews with close associates and former employees portray an organisation that was chronically understaffed and which lacked basic security measures and financial controls. </p> <p>The business was run more like a feudal court than a modern company, according to the employees. Decision-making and knowledge of the company's affairs was restricted to Bankman-Fried and a handful of close friends in their late 20s, many of whom lived together in a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas and were in romantic relationships with one another. </p> <p>Loyalty was prioritised above all else. The initial verdict from <strong>John Ray III</strong>, the veteran insolvency professional who previously helped wind down <strong>Enron</strong> and was brought in to run the business, was devastating:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.” </p> </blockquote> <p>Don't miss the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/913ff750-d1f4-486a-9801-e05be20041c1\">full story here</a>:</p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e691a6fd-b4a8-4002-ae04-d58c46ae9a40\">wild swings</a> in the nickel price have pointed up the long road ahead for the <strong>London Metal Exchange</strong> in its efforts to regain the market's confidence in using its global benchmark for trading the precious metal, writes <em>Harry Dempsey </em>in London. </p> <p>The price of high purity nickel for delivery in three months under the LME contract fell 15 per cent in the three days to Friday to $25,235 per tonne, after climbing 20 per cent in the five days beforehand and peaking at $31,275 per tonne. </p> <p>The choppy market conditions underscored how the chaotic events of March still hang over the exchange. One of the nickel market's biggest traders, China's <strong>Tsingshan</strong>, was caught out by the war in Ukraine and a sharp squeeze on prices. </p> <p>Nickel on the LME doubled to more than $100,000 a tonne, a record, and the outsized margin calls threatened to engulf smaller brokers. LME chief executive <strong>Matthew Chamberlain</strong> was forced to suspend trading for a week and cancel more than eight hours of trades, causing uproar among many of its users. LME trading volumes have declined since then as many traders have pulled back their activity — the resultant thinner market has exacerbated market moves.</p> <h1>10 unmissable stories this week</h1> <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f569ce7-e4eb-4bc6-a7f6-cbf6fde9be35\">has overruled</a> the <strong>Bank of England</strong> on a key part of insurance reforms intended to unlock tens of billions of pounds of investment into the real economy.
