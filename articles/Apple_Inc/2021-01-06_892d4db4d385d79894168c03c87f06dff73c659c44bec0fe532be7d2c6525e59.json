He will become only the 11th black senator in US history.</p> <p>In the other Georgia Senate race, Mr Ossoff led Republican incumbent David Perdue by nearly 16,000 votes.</p> <p>US government bonds and technology stock futures <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1076a42c-be4c-43bf-a2be-5a06b92a7f40\">sold off sharply</a> on the prospect of the Democrats controlling the White House and both houses of Congress. If Democrats win both contests it would prove pivotal for Joe Biden's presidency, giving him more leeway to implement his legislative agenda.</p> <p>Mr Biden is set to be officially declared the victor of the 2020 US presidential election on Wednesday when Congress meets to certify the vote. On the eve of what is normally a ceremonial occasion Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ff4a677-eb2e-438e-ac48-bb5da5a0e588\">falsely suggested</a> that vice-president Mike Pence could use the occasion to nullify the result. Mr Pence, who never contradicts the president, faces <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/caf4d412-06d8-4dda-a748-b0a0fb55f296\">a big dilemma</a> if he wants to maintain the support of his boss.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 13 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bf4ac60-cffa-4bbb-a7bc-6bdd0adff659\">Republican senators</a>, led by Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, have been less squeamish about defending the constitution and are planning to resist the certification of Mr Biden's victory. Business groups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fe61a5e-b57a-4a99-8985-ad7867a500b0\">voiced alarm</a> at the threat the move posed to US democracy.
