  "title": "Universal Spinoff to Test Music as Investment",
  "text": "<p>Analysts value Universal Music above 40 billion euros, equivalent to about $46.9 billion, higher than recent estimates and transactions indicate. In August, the company was valued at 33 billion euros, when billionaire William Ackman bought a 10% interest through his Pershing Square Holdings Ltd. hedge fund. The purchase came after Mr. Ackman scrapped ambitious plans to use his special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, to invest in Universal, citing Securities and Exchange Commission concerns.</p><p>Last year, Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. doubled its stake in Universal to about 20% in a deal that valued the business at about 30 billion euros.</p><p>When the shares list, the Tencent-led consortium will have a 20% stake, and Mr. Ackman's entities and Vivendi each will have 10%. The rest will be distributed to each Vivendi shareholder. As a result, a French investor and former chairman of Vivendi, Vincent Bollore, will hold an 18% stake. There are no restrictions on investors that would keep them from selling the shares upon receiving them.</p><p>Tencent and Mr. Ackman have expressed interest in holding Universal long-term. Vivendi said it would hold on to its stake for at least two years to remain associated and for tax reasons. Whether Mr. Bollore chooses to hold on to his stake -- which would be worth roughly 6 billion euros at a 33 billion euro valuation -- will be closely watched by investors and analysts.</p><p>Because Mr. Bollore controls Vivendi via a 27% stake, that means he will control some 28% of Universal either directly or indirectly. People close to Mr. Bollore said it was unclear what the tycoon would do with his stake, though they expect he will likely hold on to it for a while.</p><p>Mr. Ackman has laid out a bullish case for music, pronouncing it a better streaming business than video and drawing comparisons to the software industry. \"You need food and water to live, but music comes next,\" Mr. Ackman said. \"If you own UMG, you own a royalty on people listening to music.\"</p><p>At a presentation to analysts last month, Universal executives said they expect revenue to grow by more than 10% this year at constant currencies, and profit to rise by double that amount.</p><p>The targets led Barclays to increase its valuation of the company to 41.4 billion euros from 38.5 billion euros. JPMorgan analysts said they believe their base case value of 54 billion euros \"will prove conservative.\"</p><p>Once public, analysts say, Universal will be the best way to participate in the music market. Competitor Sony Music Entertainment is accessible only as a small piece of Japanese conglomerate Sony Group Corp.; Warner Music Group Corp. has less than 15% of its stock listed publicly and is controlled by billionaire Len Blavatnik.</p><p>Universal's prospectus outlines the growth prospects of the music business, in which it commands some 40% market share. The more big acts it has under its umbrella, the more Universal makes from its licensing agreements with music-streaming services, such as those offered by Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Nine of the top 10 recording artists of 2020, by sales -- and slices of the 10th -- are on its roster, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.</p><p>After years of decimation because of piracy and plummeting CD sales, the music industry has been growing since 2016, thanks to the rise of music streaming. \"Even with its strong growth in recent years, UMG believes streaming is still in the early stages of global penetration,\" the music company said, pointing to technological innovations across devices and formats such as voice-controlled speakers and connected cars. It also highlighted music's intersection with social media and gaming, and licensing opportunities in digital health and fitness industries.</p><p>Vivendi is cashing in on its longtime prized asset. The French company, which dates to the middle of the 19th century, will be left with businesses that include French pay-TV group Canal Plus, ad-holding firm Havas and publishing company Editis, as well as small divisions like the videogame maker Gameloft. (On Wednesday, Vivendi struck a deal to increase its stake in French media group Lagardere SA to 45.1% and indicated its intent to take over the entire company.)</p><p>Vivendi has held Universal since 2000, when it bought the media assets of Canadian conglomerate Seagram Co., then controlled by the Bronfman family.</p><p>Mr. Bollore has made a fortune over the past three decades by seizing control of businesses, often without paying a premium. It took Mr. Bollore less than two years to effectively take control of Vivendi after exchanging some pay-TV operations he owned for a small stake. Though his holding company remains Vivendi's No. 1 shareholder, Mr. Bollore was replaced on Vivendi's board by his son, Cyrille, in 2019, one year after another son, Yannick, succeeded him as chairman.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
