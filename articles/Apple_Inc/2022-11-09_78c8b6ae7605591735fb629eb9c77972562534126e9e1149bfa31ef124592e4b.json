  "title": "Business News: Netflix Looks to Add Live Sports --- Discussions center on events that won't carry burdensome cost, including tennis, cycling",
  "text": "<p>Additionally, in an effort to bypass the ever-escalating costs of bidding for sports rights, Netflix executives have had discussions about buying lower-profile leagues, people familiar with the discussions said. The company late last year was in talks to buy World Surf League, but negotiations fell apart because the two organizations couldn't reach an agreement on a price, people familiar with the potential deal said.</p><p>Some Netflix executives believe that given the size of its platform, Netflix could turn lesser-known sports like surfing into big franchises, and create new sporting tournaments or events, the people said.</p><p>Netflix's potential foray into sports comes as many of its streaming rivals have spent heavily for access to high-profile sporting events. Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video is now the primary home of \"Thursday Night Football,\" while Apple Inc.'s Apple TV+ and Comcast Corp.'s Peacock had exclusive rights to stream specific Major League Baseball games last season.</p><p>Earlier this year, Netflix bid for the live U.S. streaming rights to Formula One -- a sport whose profile has risen significantly in the U.S. thanks to a popular Netflix documentary series -- but lost out to Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Netflix co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings has said in meetings that he doesn't want to get caught in bidding wars every few years, according to people familiar with the discussions. That is partly why some executives are pushing for buying stakes in sports leagues, they said.</p><p>Netflix has struggled to add new subscribers in recent quarters after years of rapid growth. It recently launched an ad-backed tier of service and has vowed to crack down on password-sharing in an attempt to boost revenue and subscriber growth. The company has said it would keep its content spending steady at around $17 billion in the next few years.</p><p>Sports, as well as news, are among the rare types of programming that people still watch live. This appeals to advertisers because viewers who tune in for a big event watch for hours. Devout fans of a given league are also likely to stick around until the end of a season, which can help reduce customer defections.</p><p>\"No other category of content comes with an existing audience that has to watch it live,\" said Lee Berke, president and CEO of LHB Sports, Entertainment &amp; Media Inc.</p>",
