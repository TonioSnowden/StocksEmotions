  "text": "<p>\"We see perishable demand stemming from the Zhengzhou Foxconn plant disruption, instead of an outright production deferral\" to the March quarter, Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note to clients Sunday.</p><p>His industry conversations indicate that utilization at the Zhengzhou plant is now up to 30%, from 20% at the end of November, but his \"base case is that utilization won't return to normal until sometime [in] late January, at the earliest.\"</p><p>Long rates the stock at equal weight with a $144 price target.</p><p>See also: Qualcomm stock declines after Wells Fargo turns bearish</p><p>Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang has an outperform rating on Apple's stock, but he lowered his price target to $170 from $190 on concerns related to the production constraints. The price-target cut comes in conjunction with a reduction in his fiscal 2023 estimates that stems, he said, from \"later-than-expected iPhone production capacity recovery in China.\"</p><p>\"Our reduced outlook also accounts for loss of iPhone demand in [the March quarter] due to supply constraints during the holidays,\" Yang wrote. \"As a result, we also model more conservative accessories and software and service revenues associated with new phone sales.\"</p><p>While he's more cautious on that near-term dynamic, he also noted that with the recent easing of China's zero-COVID policy, he has \"more confidence over accelerated iPhone capacity recovery in Zhengzhou\" and doesn't expect additional pandemic-driven production issues in the new year.</p><p>Apple shares are near flat in midday trading Monday. The stock has lost 21% over the past 12 months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has shed 6% over the same span.</p><p>Apple faces risk of 'perishable demand' for iPhones, analysts say</p>",
