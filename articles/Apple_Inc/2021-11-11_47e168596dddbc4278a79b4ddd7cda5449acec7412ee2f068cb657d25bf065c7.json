From an ambitious caramel-apple pie élevée to a super-simple Key lime mousse you can whip up last-minute, these are recipes we need this year.",
  "text": "<p>IN SOME WAYS, 2021 isn't so different from 1621, the year of the fabled first Thanksgiving: We come to the table with a craving for some reassuring sweetness as well as a wish to meet the mere fact of persevering with an act of gratitude. As far as I know, no one has come up with a better way to satisfy both impulses than baking a pie. We've rounded up some of our favorite recipes from the past few years, from a classic but impressive sweet-potato pie to a sweet-and-savory apple gouda one. There are ample options, too, for vegan and gluten-free bakers. And if you really want to keep things as easy as possible—with a 15-minute mince pie, for instance, or an elegantly simple French pumpkin custard—not a problem. We've got you covered.</p><p>Showstopper Recipes </p><p>Find the recipe below for the lemon meringue pie pictured here, top right, along with a strawberry pie and a blueberry crumble pie from Woodruff's Cafe and Pie Shop in Monroe, Va.

For these ambitious types we offer recipes for a caramel-apple pie élevée with a magnificent basket-weave crust a full three inches high; a sweet potato pie dolloped with elegant whipped-cream quenelles; a striking chocolate-rye lattice filled with billows of snowy meringue; and a fragrant cranberry-sage pie topped with a starburst crust. Though a lemon meringue pie is indisputably an American classic, to many it might not sound like the typical Thanksgiving choice, and in this case they'd be right: The recipe, from Angela Scott of Woodruff's Cafe and Pie Shop in Monroe, Va., is a real standout, crowned with spectacular, perfectly toasted meringue peaks.</p><p>Innovative Flavors </p><p>Salted maple whipped cream provides a tasty counterpoint to this tart vinegar pie.

But the Thanksgiving table has always made space for ingredients from a wide range of culinary traditions as well as flavor combinations that reflect the creativity of individual cooks. At Sister Pie, Lisa Ludwinski's celebrated bakery in Detroit, the apple sage gouda pie boldly blurs the line between sweet and savory. Bold is the right word, too, for the pop of color and tart flavor that this muhallabiyeh and hibiscus rose tart from chef Reem Kassis brings to a holiday spread. If you like that tangy flavor profile, you might want to try this Appalachian-style vinegar pie, which West Virginia chef Mike Costello garnishes with a salted maple whipped cream. You'll also find the irresistible combination of salty and sweet in mazurek, a nutty salted-caramel tart that puts a Slavic spin on the more-expected pecan pie. And this milk chocolate pudding pie with halvah whipped cream offers an elegant update on the crowd-pleasing chocolate-peanut butter combo, with a crust that's effectively failproof.</p><p>Simple Pleasures </p><p>In this silky pumpkin flamusse, a splash of rum and a sprinkling of orange zest balance the sweet pumpkin.

HWANG, Prop Styling by ANETA FLORCZYK</p><p>And then there are those looking to keep the feast totally low-key and low-effort. The pledge of allegiance never mentions rolling out pie crust. Why not keep things easy and focus on the filling? Pumpkin flamusse, the custardy French dessert laced with dark rum, takes just 40 minutes and zero culinary skill to prepare. A light, bright Key lime mousse might be all some of us want after several hours of feasting. If apple pie is your thing but, this year, stress and fuss are not, this apple custard crisp should do the trick. And for those who still want pie but no pressure, these easiest-ever mini mince pies made with frozen puff pastry demand a mere 15-minute commitment from the cook.</p><p>Gorgeous Gluten-Free and Vegan Options </p><p>A splendid array of vegan desserts, from a coconut-parsnip tart (far left) to a dark and stormy crumble (at front).

This gluten-freewarm hazelnut brown butter torte is enough to make anyone at the table weak in the knees, while plant-based eaters and omnivores alike will love these vegan recipes for a dark and stormy crumble, a cornmeal-molasses pudding, a coconut-parsnip tart and a chocolate-swirled pumpkin Bundt cake with molasses glaze.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Share your experience with these recipes.
