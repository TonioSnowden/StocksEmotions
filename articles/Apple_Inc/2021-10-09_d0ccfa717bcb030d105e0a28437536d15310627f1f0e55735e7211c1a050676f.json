  "text": "<p><strong>Muriel Barbery, 52, a French former lecturer in philosophy, is the author of novels including </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/919b3cf0-9662-11dd-9dce-000077b07658\"><em><strong>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</strong></em></a><strong>, which has sold more than 10 million copies&#xa0;worldwide.</strong> </p> <p><strong>What was your childhood or earliest ambition?</strong> <br>To be one of the Famous Five by Enid Blyton. With my girlfriends, we would explore our surroundings, biking or strolling, while inventing gripping detective stories. In a way, being a novelist, I remain faithful to that early aim.</p> <p><strong>Private school or state school? University or straight into work?</strong> <br>State school, then Ecole Normale Supérieure. And after that, I didn't leave school, since in the first part of my adult life I was a teacher in the public system. I am very attached to the idea of an egalitarian educational system.</p> <p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor?</strong> <br>Each time I doubt myself or need advice, I read Flaubert's correspondence. How much I'd have liked to share a glass of wine and talk endlessly with him! Everything about the writing process is in his letters.</p> <p><strong>How physically fit are you?</strong> <br>I have to fight time and again my penchant for contemplation. </p> <p><strong>Ambition or talent: which matters more to success?</strong> <br>It depends on what they mean. In the age of bestseller lists and the mass market and speculation, I sometimes wonder if it is still possible to see art and literature as the fruits of a genuine call for beauty, meaning and authenticity. In this sense, ambition and talent are two sides of the same coin — of the desire to explore one's soul. Also, I believe that life is about trying, not necessarily about succeeding. Bliss is in the path. </p> <p><strong>How politically committed are&#xa0;you?</strong> <br>That belongs mostly to my private sphere. But I find no excuse to not denounce publicly the ecological pillage of the&#xa0;Earth.</p> <p><strong>What would you like to own that you don't currently possess?</strong> <br>A wooden house on the shore of a Japanese river with a tea room and a Zen garden.</p> <p><strong>What's your biggest extravagance?</strong> <br>Writing novels. Nobody asks you to invent these stories, make up these characters, put these words together, while everybody asks the baker for bread or the doctor for care. But in the end, people buy and read your books! That is as extravagant as it is wonderful.</p> <p><strong>In what place are you happiest?</strong> <br>In Kyoto and in my house in the French countryside.</p> <p><strong>What ambitions do you still have?</strong> <br>Write better books. Never give up on making progress and exploring new territories.</p> <p><strong>What drives you on?</strong> <br>The search for moments of grace in the midst of daily life, together with my passion for writing.</p> <p><strong>What is the greatest achievement of your life so far?</strong> <br>Love. I was once told that many people about to die express the same regret: not to have loved enough. If I die tomorrow, I will have loved fully and not only in a romantic way, considering that friendship is a part of love.</p> <p><strong>What do you find most irritating in other people?</strong><br>The same thing I find irritating and try to fight in myself: the need to be right, which, as Camus wrote, is “the sign of a vulgar mind”.</p> <p><strong>If your 20-year-old self could see you now, what would she think?</strong> <br>I guess she would be relieved to see how lucky I have been so far and how blessed I am.</p> <p><strong>Which object that you've lost do you wish you still had?</strong> <br>The book of short stories I wrote when I was 12, that my father typed and bound with a nice cover illustration. It was called <em>The Boat</em> and comprised a dozen portraits. In the end, you discovered that all the characters were sailing on the same boat! I am quite sad it was lost.</p> <p><strong>What is the greatest challenge of our time?</strong><br>Reversing the lethal ecological process the Earth is trapped in. Changing our ways of living. Trying not to get discouraged by the fear that it is too late. </p> <p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife?</strong> <br>No and neither do I believe in reincarnation. That makes my job clear: things have to be done now.</p> <p><strong>If you had to rate your satisfaction with your life so far, out of 10, what would you score?</strong> <br>20? I am not fond of figures in such&#xa0;matters.</p> <p><em>“A Single Rose” by Muriel Barbery, translated into English by Alison Anderson, is published by Gallic Books</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
