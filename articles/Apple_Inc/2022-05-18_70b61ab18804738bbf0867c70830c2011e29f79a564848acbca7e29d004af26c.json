  "title": "Finance News:  Apple  Halts Plan  For 3 Days  In Office  ----  By Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>   Apple Inc. is sticking with two days back in the office each week, for now. </p><p>   The iPhone maker on Tuesday paused plans to start bringing employees back to the office an extra day a week, amid an increase in Covid-19 cases in the San Francisco area and complaints from some workers unhappy with the proposed increase. </p><p>   After several delays, Apple began returning to the office at least one day a week in early April with a plan to gradually increase to three days next week. </p><p>   Workers had already resumed two days a week. Some workers have left the company over its determination to be in person more. </p><p>   The company's memo to workers on Tuesday didn't include a new timeline for increasing in-office time. </p><p>   It was the latest twist in Apple's efforts to return to some semblance of normality more than two years after the global pandemic upended daily life. </p><p>   The Cupertino, Calif., tech company was among the first companies to send workers home as the coronavirus spread and it remains one of the highest-profile examples of the challenges of striking a balance in returning. </p><p>   As businesses large and small have tried to navigate a hybrid-work life, some have narrowed their ambitions of returning to two days from three days a week amid a tight labor market and workers looking for more flexibility. </p><p>   Apple's delayed plans were earlier reported by Bloomberg News. </p><p></p>",
