The global average has already increased by roughly 1.1°C - 1.2°C and if dramatic action isn't taken, it could hit 3°C—a catastrophe for the critical Earth systems upon which humanity relies.</p><p>In the run up to the conference, we'll be asking:</p><p>* Can humanity slow the pace of global warming?</p><p>* How well can people adapt to climate change?</p><p>* Who will pay the price of a hotter planet?</p><p>* What innovations could counteract the damage done by climate change?</p><p>The new podcast is hosted by Vijay Vaitheeswaran, The Economist's global energy &amp; climate innovation editor, with Catherine Brahic, environment editor, and Oliver Morton, briefings editor.</p><p>Together they ask expert guests whether and how the pace of global warming can be slowed and explore how everything - from finance to agriculture, transport to international policy - might need to change in order to do it.</p><p>The series will map out the path to tackling climate change with intelligent and informed analysis of the three key steps that need to happen: reducing emissions and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere; adapting to climate change; and getting the politics right in Glasgow and beyond.</p><p>“To a Lesser Degree\" is an eight-part special series, with new episodes published every Monday, starting 27th September 2021.</p><p>Subscribe and listen on:</p><p>Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Pocket Casts | Google | Overcast</p><p>or wherever you get your podcasts</p><p>“To a Lesser Degree\" is part of our collection of award-winning podcasts which include “The Intelligence\", “The Economist Asks\", \"Money Talks\" and “Checks and Balance\".</p><p>The podcast is complemented by our newsletter “The Climate Issue\", published fortnightly on Mondays and in this package we aim to give our readers and listeners fair-minded analysis of a politically, and emotionally, heated topic.</p><p>Subscribe and listen on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Pocket Casts | Google | Overcast</p><p>To dig deeper and follow the global climate story:</p><p>* Sign up for “The Climate Issue\" newsletter</p><p>* Read and watch our coverage of climate change</p><p>* And full access to The Economist's print, digital and audio editions subscribe now at: economist.com/climatepod</p>",
