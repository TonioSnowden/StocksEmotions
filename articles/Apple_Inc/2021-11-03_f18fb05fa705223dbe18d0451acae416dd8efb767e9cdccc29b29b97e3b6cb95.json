  "text": "<p>Later this week, doctors, nurses and pharmacists could start administering the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, which federal health regulators recently authorized for use in young children ages 5 to 11 years.</p><p>While a large number of parents have expressed eagerness to vaccinate their young children as soon as possible, many others say they will wait, out of concerns the inoculations could have unexpected or long-term side effects, affect fertility, or were too rushed.</p><p>\"It's kind of like an iPhone; you always wait and see how the bugs are,\" said Cherish Latting, 36, a bar manager in Roxie, Miss.</p><p>Ms. Latting said she is vaccinated, along with two of her teenage sons. Yet she said she would wait and see that the vaccines aren't causing side effects before signing up her 9-year-old daughter.</p><p>There are 28 million 5- to 11-year-olds in the U.S. Covid-19 infections are usually mild in children, according to doctors, though some can become serious -- in rare cases, leading to hospitalization and even death.</p><p>Health authorities want to vaccinate the youths to protect them and to limit their ability to spread the virus to more vulnerable older people. The drive to vaccinate the youngsters is expected to start in some places as soon as Wednesday, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off Tuesday night.</p><p>A CDC advisory panel voted unanimously in support of the vaccines. The CDC had been waiting for the vote before issuing its own recommendation.</p><p>The campaign should be running at full capacity next week, said White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients. Parents will be able to search a federal website -- vaccines.gov -- to find a vaccination site and sign up their children, he said.</p><p>Some 27% of parents said they would vaccinate their 5- to 11-year-olds right away, while 33% said they would wait and see, and 5% said they would go ahead only if their child's school requires vaccination, according to a recent survey of 1,519 people, including 219 parents of 5- to 11-year-olds, by the Kaiser Family Foundation. About 30% said they wouldn't vaccinate their children.</p><p>More than 70% of the polled parents said they were very or somewhat concerned that not enough is known about long-term side effects, or their children might experience serious side effects. Two-thirds of parents in the Kaiser survey said they were concerned the vaccines would hurt their child's fertility in the future.</p><p>The CDC has said there is no evidence that Covid-19 vaccines cause fertility problems. But the concern continues to circulate, though its provenance is unclear.</p><p>Citing fertility and other concerns of long-term side effects, Samantha Golembo, a 30-year-old from Brooklyn who has 2-year-old twins and a 5-year-old son, said she won't get him vaccinated unless his school requires it.</p><p>Ms. Golembo said she got vaccinated because the nursing home where she works required it. She expressed concern about the shot's rapid development. \"I am pro-vaccine, my kids are up-to-date with vaccines -- it's just the simple fact of this vaccine being so rushed,\" she said.</p><p>Pediatricians and immunologists say the benefits of vaccinating young children outweigh the risks. Covid-19 is the eighth-leading cause of death in children, killing more than 700 under the age of 18 years since the start of the pandemic, according to the CDC. The deaths are largely vaccine-preventable, pediatricians said.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be safe and 90.7% effective in a clinical trial, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Side effects in children were similar to those in adults and adolescents, including injection site pain, headaches, chills, fever and fatigue, the agency said.</p><p>It is rare that side effects that haven't appeared in adults or adolescents would appear in younger children, said Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at Stanford University.</p><p>The way the vaccine works -- delivering messenger RNA that disintegrates relatively quickly after it is injected into the body -- also suggests a low risk for long-term side effects, Dr. Maldonado said.</p><p>Like many other parents, Ms. Latting in Mississippi said she was concerned about myocarditis, an inflammatory heart condition, after reviewing a pamphlet about it when her sons were vaccinated.</p><p>The risk of myocarditis is low and cases that have come up have largely been mild and resolved quickly, according to studies. The risk of myocarditis after Covid-19 infection is much higher, according to several studies.</p><p>---</p><p>Sabrina Siddiqui contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
