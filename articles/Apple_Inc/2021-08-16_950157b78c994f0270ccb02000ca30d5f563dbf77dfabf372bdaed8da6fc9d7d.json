  "text": "<p>Cleveland -- Having emerged from lockdown, with fresh perspectives on life during quarantine, we are well-primed, perhaps, for \"Private Lives: Home and Family in the Art of the Nabis, Paris, 1889-1900,\" an exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art. Co-organized by CMA chief curator Heather Lemonedes Brown and Mary Weaver Chapin, a curator at Oregon's Portland Art Museum (where the show opens in October), \"Private Lives\" explores the domestic-themed pictures, mostly interiors, by the four chief members of the Nabis: Felix Vallotton (1865-1925), Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947), Edouard Vuillard (1868-1940) and Maurice Denis (1870-1943).</p><p>A tightly knit band of young, fin-de-siecle Parisian painters, the Nabis (Hebrew for \"Prophets\") sought to elevate Impressionism from perceptual to poetic, spiritual sensations -- to imbue light-filled, decorative surfaces with deep feeling and symbolic weight, veering at times toward mysticism. Utilizing Impressionist and Post-Impressionist brushwork, the Nabis synthesized the intimate scenes of the 17th-century Dutch masters; the transient, everyday themes of Japanese Ukiyo-e prints; the serpentine line of Art Nouveau; and the heightened, expressive color of the Symbolists, especially Paul Gauguin.</p><p>Also known as \"the generation of intimists,\" the Nabis strived, in Bonnard's words, \"to draw emotion from the most modest acts of life.\" Intimacy, of course, takes many forms. It implies small private pleasures, familial closeness, warm hearth, tenderness -- but also drama, secrets, claustrophobia, codependence, rivalry, betrayal. The Nabis, with a plurality of interests and approaches -- and creating not just pictures but also graphic, theatrical, interior and industrial designs -- explored these themes from many angles.</p><p>\"Private Lives\" -- comprising 39 oil paintings and 115 works on paper, including a handful of watercolors but primarily prints -- focuses on pictures of home life. Divided into five sections -- \"The Intimate Interior / The Troubled Interior,\" \"Family Life,\" \"Music chez soi,\" \"In the Garden\" and \"The Nabis City\" -- it opens with Vuillard's mesmerizing interior \"Woman in a Striped Dress\" (1895). Suggesting garden and visitation, its two women, blending with wallpaper patterns and vases of bouquets, blossom as if they were flowers while a golden, angelic child floats above them.</p><p>Nearby are two other Vuillards. His \"Woman Sewing by an Open Window\" (1895) is a darkened interior dappled with cool, afternoon light, reminiscent of both Henri Matisse and Jan Vermeer. In the surreal double portrait \"Interior, Mother and Sister of the Artist\" (1893), his seated mother anchors the room like a black hole; his sister, braced against the wall and bending over, as if cowering beneath the encroaching ceiling, both sinks into and emerges from animated wallpaper.</p><p>In these and other works, Vuillard balances beauty and unease; simplicity and anticipation; comfort and foreboding. In his portrait \"Grandmother Michaud Seen Against the Light\" (1890), her darkened silhouette is engulfed as if in flames. Vuillard's brushstrokes are often roughened and opaque -- suggesting ancient fresco. And his tactile surfaces, teeming like petri dishes seen under a microscope, are charged, alive. You can feel his eye and brush searching intuitively, empathetically, not just among forms and through space but among interpersonal relationships, if not memories, as he weaves a melancholic fabric of light, energies, tensions.</p><p>Even more instinctive and inventive is Bonnard, whose pictures are deceptively plain-spoken. In his dreamy landscape \"Apple Gathering\" (c. 1895-96), red apples and a linear, black-and-white brushwork of trees enliven a field of creamy aquamarine; a woman and children, collecting and eating fruit, give weight to the foreground. In the paintings \"The Children's Meal\" (1895) and \"The Lamp\" (c. 1899), Bonnard's humble scenes explore the bizarre landscape of the dining table. Walls open into the distance like night sky and countryside. Tablecloths, quivering, flow like iridescent lava fields. People -- especially the elderly and infants -- feel distorted, alien. But so, too, do animals and objects. Yet one never feels that Bonnard exaggerates.</p><p>Comparatively, Vallotton's pictures feel illustrative, over-stylized -- planned out and then executed. Most beguiling is his \"Intimacies\" (1897-98), a series of ambiguously titled, black-and-white woodcuts exploring lovers' joys and tribulations.</p><p>Denis, whose Gauguin-influenced paintings also devolve into the schematic, is best represented here with gorgeous prints. Two unusual oils -- the stippled \"Child With Apron or Little Girl in a Red Dress\" (1897), suggesting children's art, and the lovely, primitive \"Moonrise at the Priory\" (1894), reminiscent of Henri Rousseau -- are beautiful exceptions. And Denis shines in the soft-focus, color lithographs \"The Reflection in the Fountain\" (1897) and \"Love\" (1899), his wistful series of romantic musings on his courtship with Marthe Meurier.</p><p>Still, in this overhung, uneven show's unwittingly competitive atmosphere, it's impossible not to see Vuillard, and particularly Bonnard, not only as more compelling painters than Vallotton and Denis, but also as far superior graphic artists. This impression is furthered by the fact that, though beautifully designed and installed, the exhibition feels like a massive print show fleshed out with paintings. When \"Private Lives\" is good, however, it's great. The Nabis are often undersold as a Post-Impressionist stepping stone on modernism's path. This welcome show, long overdue, proves the Nabis are fertile, relevant. Quarantine or no quarantine, this exhibition's themes of home and family are universal.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Esplund, the author of \"The Art of Looking: How to Read Modern and Contemporary Art\" (Basic Books), writes about art for the Journal.</p>",
