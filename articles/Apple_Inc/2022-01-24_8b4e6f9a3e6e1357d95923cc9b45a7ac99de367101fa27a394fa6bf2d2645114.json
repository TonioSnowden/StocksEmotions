  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start</strong>: <strong>Nelson Peltz</strong>'s activist hedge fund <strong>Trian Partners</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a17a6811-78a8-4eb7-a2be-adbb8eb75119\">built a stake</a> in Unilever, ratcheting up the pressure on the FTSE 100 company after its abortive pursuit of <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>'s consumer health business.</p> <h1>Michael Hintze warns on China's Covid strategy</h1> <p>Last week I caught up with <strong>Sir Michael Hintze</strong>, founder of $21.6bn London-based hedge fund <strong>CQS</strong>. He thinks geopolitical events are even more likely to be felt in markets this year. One area he's particularly worried about? Already stretched supply chains, and notably how China's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fc48ac3-5328-4dc5-b8e6-efa52b050b59\">zero-Covid policy</a> (ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing next month) is creating bottlenecks for materials such as copper, lithium and rare earth metals, and inhibiting the energy transition.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dbc60a5-29c0-45f2-a72c-566c4cfc20ec\">Hintze says</a>: </p> <blockquote>  <p>“In the UK we are nearing herd immunity because of the Omicron variant and high vaccination rates, so we can increasingly live with the virus. In China, where they haven't done that, they have had to shut down most of their economy to fight the pandemic. And this has a huge impact on the global supply chain.”</p> </blockquote> <p>In this environment, he thinks that individual countries must consider their own supply chain sovereignty and domestic production facilities, onshoring the supply of semiconductors, chemicals and raw materials. </p> <p>“When it comes to supply chains we need to think about geopolitics,” says Hintze, whose flagship fund rebounded last year after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd0f73e5-1b78-42c3-a6e5-a4444034fd26\">a tough 2020</a>. “It's about sovereignty, it's about resilience, regrettably it's inflationary too because it's less efficient and it causes inequality if you're not careful. So it's a really big deal.”</p> <p>What do you think is the biggest geopolitical risk for markets in 2022?

But they face a more uncertain outlook in 2022, as my colleague <em>Adrienne Klasa</em> reports in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/415bcf2a-c9d5-4a1a-90bb-80ac8d3bc43c\">analysis</a>. There are two key pressures: mounting research costs and hits to the big growth stocks that have helped power their outperformance.</p> <p>In Europe, research budgets at asset management houses have more than halved between 2016 and 2022, according to estimates from <strong>Frost Consulting</strong>, since the companies started financing them out of their own budgets instead of through investor fees under Mifid II reforms. At the same time, the costs of running ESG strategies have ballooned as funds have launched and grown, and may eclipse overall research budgets by 2024. All of this is straining already thin margins and potentially endangering sustainable strategies if a market correction takes hold.</p> <p>Meanwhile many ESG strategies have been exposed as growth or tech funds by another name. At the end of December, the top positions held across the world's 20 largest ESG funds, which together manage about $340bn in assets, were technology giants <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>'s parent company <strong>Alphabet</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong>, according to <strong>Rumi Mahmood</strong>, vice-president of ESG research at <strong>MSCI</strong>. </p> <p>Yet while tech shares have been big winners during the pandemic, they have taken a hit since the turn of the year — fuelling speculation that a more sustained rotation towards value strategies is in the offing as the US <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> starts to withdraw Covid-era monetary stimulus. </p> <p><strong>David McCann</strong>, equity analyst at <strong>Numis</strong>, said: </p> <blockquote>  <p>“This year is going to be an important test for the ESG industry. I'm not convinced that 100 per cent of people who are buying sustainable funds are doing so purely for environmental and ethical reasons. Many are in it as ‘tourists' because these just happened to be the best performing funds.”</p> </blockquote> <h1>Crypto clampdown gathers steam</h1> <p>Bosses at the UK's <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong> have been champing at the bit to crack down on crypto ads. The regulator's chair <strong>Charles Randell</strong> told a parliamentary committee in December: “As I go around London and see things on the sides of buses, the first thing I do is ring the office asking, ‘What can we do about this?'”</p> <p>Until this week, the answer has been “not much”.</p> <p>Adverts like the well-known <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f317c2b-cb5f-4ebd-abfe-0dc5725d5538\"><strong>Luno</strong> promotions</a> “If you're seeing Bitcoin on the Underground, it's time to buy” and anonymously backed “memecoin” <strong>Floki Inu'</strong>s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4da6160-a632-423b-8d8b-ca86489f1d22\">marketing blitz</a> have proliferated across the country and online.</p> <p>Now, chancellor <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> has handed the FCA the job of bringing crypto promotions in line with the strict rules for other high-risk investments. And he's not alone in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d58c5181-aabc-47e5-bac1-8f68dc43928d\">signalling a crackdown</a>, reports my colleague <em>Joshua Oliver</em>.</p> <p>Spain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a119dc9e-189d-4a87-ae02-a81a37260196\">is leading</a> the European crackdown on crypto promotions, unwilling to wait for the glacial EU rulemaking process to tackle what it sees as a pressing consumer protection issue. And Singapore has gone even further by banning swaths of crypto advertising outright.</p> <p>Our <em>FT Money </em>columnist <em>Merryn Somerset Webb</em> has some thoughts on this:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“I can't imagine how a crypto ad will be all these things — upfront about having no yield, no obvious fundamental value and no accepted valuation method, for example — and still be compelling. Something to look forward to.”</p> </blockquote> <p>And she also has a word for investors who are quick to scoff at crypto losses. Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d71cda4-c399-4dff-afaf-57ff655f59bd\">what's inside</a> your own portfolios — notably long-duration assets in tech and ESG that are looking vulnerable as interest rates rise.</p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>Want to see a stark example of the rotation between growth and value investment styles? Look no further than the Sage of Omaha and the “Queen of the bull market”. <strong>Cathie Wood</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d26e8ee6-f724-4a7a-8cef-61bd5f101c28\">flagship <strong>Ark Invest</strong> fund </a>is on the cusp of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42bb6639-79a0-48da-9f21-01f33e7370f9\">being overtaken</a> by <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>'s <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> in the performance table, after a shift in fortunes between the two prominent investors. This year has been particularly tough for often-unprofitable technology growth stocks favoured by Wood, and buoyant for the steadier equities that are the hallmark of Buffett. The power of the shift has raised eyebrows across markets. </p> <h1>11 unmissable asset management stories this week</h1> <p>Our condolences to the friends and family of <strong>Lord Paul Myners</strong>, who has died aged 73. Here's <em>John Plender</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a84e710d-dcc3-4b70-ad49-1e9da451a7b3\">obituary of Myners</a>, the opposite of a conventional City grandee. And in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/802ffa47-a3a3-4859-90eb-f070e71f492f\">this moving recollection</a>, retail veteran <strong>Lord Stuart Rose</strong> shares his memories of “a very big man in a pretty mediocre world”. He recounts the period in 2004 when he worked with Myners at <strong>M&amp;S </strong>and they fended off a hostile bid from <strong>Philip Green</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Brookfield Asset Management</strong>, the Canadian investment group best known for its real estate, infrastructure and private equity investments, is expanding its hedge fund business into Europe. It is opening an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbdf8ead-1dc2-4578-a070-453a7265393e\">office in London</a> and has begun hiring for its multi-strategy division, one of the most profitable — and competitive — corners of the industry, dominated by the likes of <strong>Citadel</strong> and <strong>Millennium Management</strong>.</p> <p><strong>BlackRock</strong>'s <strong>Larry Fink</strong> rejected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ab11b21-9a5c-480a-acd5-097ea0bb1ff3\">accusations of being “woke”</a> in his annual letter to chief executives, following attacks from US conservatives. Stakeholder capitalism is just good business, says the head of the world's largest asset manager.</p> <p><strong>Terry Smith</strong> is also on the woke warpath with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/210a5297-159c-4d34-8096-933b1d04c4a1\">fresh attacks</a> on <strong>Unilever</strong>'s management. They have responded to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a1d6f47-90e0-4639-aed7-3817d4c18ed0\">poor performance</a> at the global consumer goods company with “meaningless platitudes”, says the <strong>Fundsmith </strong>founder.</p> <p>Oil prices have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7932ca2-a215-48a5-86b6-7760b5b04c90\">surged higher in 2022</a> as buyers eye patchy production and an unstable geopolitical landscape. Could we hit $100 a barrel this year? </p> <p>Investors are on a shopping spree for bargain companies in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38b56e27-a3d2-4dfb-a3fb-6f3c6aed36a5\">unloved corners</a> of Europe's equities market, as central banks' plans to unwind their powerful stimulus programmes dull the allure of glitzier tech companies.</p> <p>The late-night witching hour, when ghouls and witches are most powerful, also produces some spooky movements in stock markets. <em>Robin Wigglesworth</em> investigates <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cc17824-3077-4e39-9a99-cbccc83a2251&#xa0;\">the curious case</a> of stocks in the night-time. </p> <p><strong>Blackstone</strong>'s $6bn purchase of <strong>Home Partners</strong> is the private equity group's boldest bet on real estate since the foreclosure crisis. Its rent-to-buy model offers the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2267d715-6ff9-428e-959a-f0e379e581e9\">promise of home ownership</a> to more Americans, but is the company selling false hope? </p> <p>“Asset management has changed more in the last dozen years than in the last three decades before,” says outgoing <strong>T Rowe Price</strong> chief <strong>Bill Stromberg</strong>. Here's his take on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57ad5eac-c574-42eb-915a-108c6a7d1a02\">how to manage teams</a> that are tired out by the pandemic and the pace of change. (A hint: you can't just jack up their pay.) </p> <p>Central banks' hawks and doves <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ecf9753-ffc4-4f2e-bbc4-cda4754ff41e\">are playing chicken</a> on how aggressively to fight inflation, writes markets editor <em>Katie Martin</em> in a column on what to expect from the most important economic decisions of 2022. </p> <p>A succession of private equity firms have raised piles of cash by going public. But another group of managers has been raising capital more discreetly — by selling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8f6efe3-592f-4dac-ab9f-a70648d34cb8\">record amounts of debt</a>. </p> <h1>And finally </h1> <p>To the National Gallery, and the first major UK exhibition of German Renaissance artist <strong>Albrecht Dürer</strong> in nearly 20 years. The exhibition follows Dürer's travels across Europe, charting his journeys to the Alps, Italy, Venice and the Netherlands, and exploring how they sparked an exchange of ideas with Netherlandish and Italian Renaissance artists.</p><p>Source: Harriet Agnew, Asset Management Editor 2022 'The sage of Omaha vs the ‘Queen of the bull market'' FT.com 24 January.
