  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- President Biden is expected to nominate Lina Khan, a critic of Big Tech's market power, to a seat on the Federal Trade Commission, according to people familiar with the situation, in a move that could signal more aggressive application of laws to ensure competition. </p><p>   Ms. Khan is a law professor at Columbia University and former Democratic staffer at the FTC and Congress. She was one of the House antitrust subcommittee staffers who wrote an October report that concluded Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., and Alphabet Inc.'s Google hold significant and durable market power, resulting in \"less innovation, fewer choices for consumers, and a weakened democracy.\" </p><p>   The White House declined to comment on the expected nomination, which was reported earlier by Politico. Ms. Khan didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   Public Citizen, the advocacy group, called the expected nomination \"a hopeful sign that the Biden administration intends to take a more aggressive approach,\" pointing to her experience as a congressional staffer. </p><p>   Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), called Ms. Khan's potential appointment \"deeply concerning\" in a statement Tuesday. He said that \"being less than four years out of law school, she lacks the experience necessary for such an important role as FTC Commissioner. Her views on antitrust enforcement are also wildly out of step with a prudent approach to the law.\" </p><p>   Ms. Khan is among a group of progressives who have suggested farther-reaching changes, such as the House report's suggestion that Congress consider forcing companies to separate large online platforms from other business lines. Other Democrats, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), haven't endorsed a law requiring structural separation and have instead proposed legal changes to help the government win antitrust cases. </p><p>   As one of five members of the FTC, Ms. Khan would be in a position to influence policies, rulemakings and enforcement actions at an agency with authority to administer antitrust and consumer-protection laws. She wouldn't be able to dictate decisions, given that she is likely to be one of three members of a Democratic majority. </p><p>   The commission is currently led by acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. She shares many of Ms. Khan's views, but is seen as more of a consensus-builder. </p><p>   Ms. Khan's nomination would mark Mr. Biden's second recent move elevating someone who is pressing for a more aggressive antitrust approach. The White House on Friday named Tim Wu, an advocate of stricter antitrust enforcement and breakups of large technology companies such as Facebook, to serve as special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy at the White House National Economic Council. </p><p>   Ms. Khan graduated from Yale Law School in 2017. That same year, she published a widely cited law review article, \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" suggesting that the prevailing approach to antitrust law is ill-equipped to deal with the potential harms posed by online platforms such as Amazon. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Andrew Restuccia contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
