  "title": "Business & Technology:  Netflix, Apple TV+ Win Big  Over Broadcast, Cable TV  ----  By John Jurgensen",
  "text": "<p>   A historic night at the Emmy Awards for AMC and other cable networks roughly a decade ago left the television industry's old guard questioning its relevance. Now the former insurgents of cable find themselves in the same wilderness. </p><p>   Back then, in 2008, it was AMC's \"Mad Men\" that became the first basic cable series to win the flagship award for outstanding drama series. It was a symbol that the major networks' long reign over TV culture was ending. No broadcaster has won that top prize since. </p><p>   The latest changing of the guard became official Sunday at the 73rd Emmy Awards, as streaming platforms swept most of the major awards. With Netflix Inc.'s first-ever wins for drama series (\"The Crown\") and limited series (\"The Queen's Gambit\"), the streamer amassed 44 total Emmys, tying a record that CBS has held since 1974. Apple TV+ stormed the comedy categories with wins, including best series for \"Ted Lasso.\" </p><p>   The crowning of the streaming era came at the expense of not just the long-suffering broadcast networks, but also some of the cable networks that unseated them in the prestige race. AMC had a single nomination, for the stunt work in action series \"Gangs of London,\" but didn't win it. FX, one of the biggest forces in cable's golden era of the 2000s and 2010s, received only three technical awards for its drama \"Pose,\" and left Sunday's ceremony empty-handed. </p><p>   HBO has routinely piled up more wins than any network or streamer, including 30 total wins in 2020. The premium cable powerhouse claimed 19 wins this year -- four for shows on HBO's streaming sibling, HBO Max. </p><p>   As they celebrated their own wins Monday, Netflix executives took a victory lap on behalf of their sector as a whole. \"It was a historic night for streaming,\" Netflix's head of global TV, Bela Bajaria, said. \"The nominations were there [for TV networks], so there's great work being done in a lot of different places, but I do think this was the streamers' year.\" </p><p>   Not every streamer succeeded. Hulu's \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" the first streaming show to win best drama, in 2017, won none of the 21 Emmys it was nominated for this year. </p><p>   Amazon Prime Video, which cracked the ranks of best comedies in 2018 with \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" was shut out, despite high-profile nominations for its drama \"The Boys\" and limited series \"The Underground Railroad.\" </p><p>   The pandemic played a role in this year's results. It influenced the kinds of shows and platforms viewers gravitated to, such as \"The Queen's Gambit,\" which triggered a run on chess sets during the lockdown months. Covid-19 also halted the production cycles for established hits, including HBO's big winner from 2020, \"Succession.\" </p><p>   Netflix countered that none of these factors merited an asterisk on the breakthrough wins for streamers. \"I believe that at any moment in history, 'The Queen's Gambit' and 'The Crown' and many of those other shows would absolutely have won and could have won,\" Ms. Bajaria said. </p><p>   One legacy network that walked away from the ceremony with a measurable win was CBS, which aired the ceremony. The network said its Emmy telecast drew 7.4 million viewers, up 16% from last year's show, a largely virtual event. </p><p></p>",
