  "text": "<p><em>How well did you keep up with the news this week? Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-08-06/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Amazon announced yesterday that they were delaying plans for staff to come back to the office, a sign of how the spread of the Delta variant is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11f403e4-3bab-4f5c-920d-03c2ccf3cb76\">hampering the plans</a> for a return to pre-Covid work life.</p> <p>They are the latest large US employers to revise or delay plans to return to the office more regularly, as the number of&#xa0;Covid infections&#xa0;in the country rises.</p> <p>Wells, one of America's largest retail banks with 4,900 branches, had hoped to bring its workers back to the office after the&#xa0;Labor Day holiday&#xa0;on September 6, the unofficial end of summer in the US. That will now be postponed until October 4.</p> <p>BlackRock has told staff that plans for a full return to their offices will be delayed until the start of October from early September.</p> <p>Amazon went further, telling its employees that the ecommerce giant is pushing back its return-to-office plans until January 3.</p> <p>Microsoft and Apple have also delayed their plans for workers to return until October, while Google, Walmart and Walt Disney have announced stricter mask or vaccine requirements for employees or customers.</p> <p>Yet Wall Street banks, which have been among the most aggressive in bringing their workers back to the office, show no sign of changing their back-to-work policies.</p> <p>“We've asked our folks, 100 per cent of the people, to come in. And that we do not intend to change,” said Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, this week. </p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Apple to scan US iPhones for child abuse </strong>Apple intends to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14440f81-d405-452f-97e2-a81458f5411f\">install software</a> on American iPhones to scan for images of child abuse, according to people briefed on the plans, raising security researchers' concerns that it could open the door to surveillance of millions of people's personal devices.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>BoE's ‘modest tightening' of monetary policy </strong>The Bank of England said “some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691\">modest tightening</a> of monetary policy is likely to be necessary” over the next two years to keep inflation under control, while in a hawkish shift most committee members indicated economic conditions had been met to start discussing raising interest rates again. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Tidjane Thiam's Spac in talks with Credijusto </strong>The former Credit Suisse chief executive's blank-cheque company is in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8072dffd-6e01-4a03-a4d7-e2d66fa742d9\">exclusive talks</a> with Mexican fintech start-up Credijusto and Latin American corporate data provider CIAL Dun &amp; Bradstreet to merge and list the groups in New York this year.</p> <p><strong>4. US offers ‘safe haven' to Hong Kongers </strong>Washington will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/916dca78-a7e0-4c49-89dc-b876b08120d4\">defer removal</a> of Hong Kong residents present in the US by 18 months, in response to China's repression of the financial hub. The homeland security department did not say how many individuals will be eligible for the offer, but a US official told the Financial Times the number affected was “in the thousands”.</p> <p><strong>5. Lionel Messi and FC Barcelona part ways </strong>The Barcelona football club said yesterday that Lionel Messi, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers in history, would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60fce12e-ed5a-4141-b265-aeded7a73bea\">leave</a> because of “financial and structural obstacles” that it blamed on regulations imposed by Spain's La Liga to rein in spending. <em>For more on the business of sport, </em><a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=5e5e3d297600b40004c209fc\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> for our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/scoreboard\"><em>Scoreboard</em></a><em> newsletter.</em></p> <h1>Tokyo Olympics round-up</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Two <strong>Belarusian </strong>coaches who allegedly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41fb2ec6-d483-4467-a748-5a37670a60e1\">tried to force</a> Krystsina Tsimanouskaya on a flight have had their accreditation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/06/ioc-strips-two-belarus-olympics-coaches-of-accreditation-over-krystsina-tsimanouskaya-scandal\">rescinded</a>.

(USA Today)</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Can Scarlett Johansson take down Hollywood studios?&#xa0;</strong>Negotiations between studios and actors are often tense but Scarlett Johansson's battle with Disney stands out. For the past seven decades, actors have enjoyed considerable leverage in Hollywood but streaming has changed that, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1550ed57-047f-46dd-a9a0-121406199076\">writes Anna Nicolaou</a>. The new metric of success is not box office revenue but subscriber numbers — and studios are not about to share subscription revenue with actors.</p> <p><strong>Crypto bros stay loyal despite gathering crackdown</strong> Why has the price of crypto held steady in face of Gensler's ‘Wild West' remarks? Despite the wild utopian vision that some of the noisy hardline crypto crowd espouse, most buyers are not trying to change the world. They are just looking for a way to make some money, generally over the long term. To them, the “regulate, don't obliterate” stance from the US authorities so far is a validation, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df42ae4d-bc2e-4847-8e68-7dec1a385c9a\">writes Market Editor Katie Martin</a>. </p> <p><strong>Pandemic shatters M&amp;A taboo for Italy's luxury brands</strong> The fashion world has been captivated by its own soap opera this summer as the biggest brands roar back from the pandemic: will legendary designer Giorgio Armani sell up?

But that has changed as coronavirus vaccination campaigns in the US and Europe advance. The recovery has been strong enough <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ca0fbd4-0f7a-408b-9b77-8e576e2b62be\">to&#xa0;attract new investors</a>.</p> <p><strong>Powerful union leader dies aged 72</strong> In over a decade as leader of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, Richard Trumka became one of the most powerful <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a92f14bc-02ae-4d00-b019-5fd5a53330b3\">labour leaders</a> in the US.
