  "text": "<p>\"With incredible growth and progress made in our mission to deploy driverless vehicles, we are making prudent adjustments to our business plan to best continue on a path for success,\" Argo said in a statement.</p><p>The spokesman added that the Pittsburgh-based startup is taking this step to correct an aggressive period of hiring and get its staffing levels back in line to hit operational goals.</p><p>Launched in 2016, Argo garnered attention as one of a handful of driverless-car firms looking to advance the autonomous-driving technology with the aim of deploying vehicles that can fully operate themselves using software and computersâ€”and without a human driver.</p><p>Over the years, it has received investments from some of the world's largest car companies.</p><p>Ford holds an ownership stake in Argo, having initially invested $1 billion in Argo in 2017. Volkswagen AG invested $2.6 billion in the tech startup.</p><p>Walmart Inc. joined with Argo and Ford last year to test an autonomous-vehicle delivery service in three U.S. cities. The firm began driverless-car operations in Miami and Austin on the Lyft Inc. network earlier this year, and aims to install 1,000 autonomous vehicles on that network in the next few years.</p><p>As Argo has built up its business, it has lured talent from established tech companies, such as Apple Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.</p><p>Still, the prospects of commercializing fully driverless technology remain uncertain with many executives saying the technical and regulatory hurdles are steeper than they initially envisioned.</p><p>Write to Nora Eckert at nora.eckert@wsj.com</p><p>Ford-Backed Driverless Car Startup Lays Off 150 Workers</p>",
