  "text": "<p>Government bond markets suffered a fresh bout of selling on Friday, halting a rally in tech stocks, after President Joe Biden said the US aimed to make vaccinations available to every adult by the start of May.</p> <p>The yield on 10-year US Treasuries jumped to 1.62 per cent, breaking through the 13-month high struck during a choppy session a week ago. </p> <p>Markets were experiencing “powerful cross-currents”, said Lauren Goodwin, economist and multi-asset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments. </p> <p>As Biden's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecc0cc34-3ca7-40f7-9b02-3b4cfeaf7099\"> $1.9tn stimulus bill</a> leads to growth, inflation and yield expectations, she says, speculation surrounding an interest rate decision next week by the Federal Reserve has also fuelled volatility.</p> <p>Following the bond sell-off, Wall Street's Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.6 per cent by the market close as the tech rally that had powered US indices to record highs this week careened&#xa0;off course. </p> <p>The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 rose 0.1 per cent.</p> <p>Large-cap tech led the losses, with Apple and Amazon both falling 0.8 per cent, while Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slid 2.4 per cent.</p> <p>The stimulus bill and the European Central Bank's pledge to increase the pace of its bond-buying programme have launched “a wall of money coming like we haven't seen since the second world war”, said Didier Rabattu, head of equities at Lombard Odier Investment Management. “The Nasdaq is made of growth companies, it's a pretty volatile index. In this environment, when rates go up, investors reprice the value of growth.” </p> <p>In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 slid 0.3 per cent in the afternoon, while London's FTSE 100 rose 0.3 per cent and Frankfurt's Xetra Dax dropped 0.5 per cent. </p> <p>On the continent, yields on the UK's 10-year gilt also leapt near a one-year high, trading at 0.83 per cent, but the sell-off in German debt was less severe, with the yield on the equivalent Bund up 0.04 percentage points at minus 0.29 per cent.</p> <p>The latest jolt of market jitters came after Biden said every US adult would be eligible for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfb266e4-2843-42bb-8806-765cc032b091\">Covid-19 vaccination by May 1</a>, and touted “some real progress” in America's fight against the pandemic in a televised address. The US president set the July 4 Independence Day holiday as a new target for a return to some normality.</p> <p>Bond markets have been volatile in recent weeks over the prospect that a swift US economic recovery would stoke inflation, which erodes the value of bonds' interest payments. </p> <p>In Asia, China's CSI 300 index closed up 0.4 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 2.2 per cent and South Korea's Kospi gained 1.4 per cent.</p><p>Source: Leke Oso Alabi and Joshua Oliver in London and Francesca Friday in New York 2021 'Bond sell-off resumes after Biden vows to accelerate vaccinations' FT.com 12 March.
