  "text": "<p>Pixie, a nutritionist, goes through her fridge and indicates which items she would have eliminated during her orthorexia phase. Meat and dairy are out: “pasta, that's got gluten, hell no”. Even an inoffensive carton of soup gets the heave-ho, and not just because of the cream it contains. “It's got more than five ingredients, that means it's processed.” An off-screen voice, presumably that of director Ziyaad Desai, asks her to explain. “Someone on the internet made it up, and it became a thing.”</p> <p>Pixie was among the many admiring Instagram followers of a radiant young Australian woman fighting off a brain tumour with a wholefood diet. In 2013, Belle Gibson claimed to have been diagnosed with cancer four years earlier and given four months to live. Her no-drug method for staving off symptoms was hugely appealing to Turner, who at age 19 faced a lifetime of statins to combat high cholesterol. Going “straight to Dr Google”, Pixie found the “wellness community”, with Gibson its high priestess. Gibson had published a clean eating cookbook, <em>The Whole Pantry,</em> with Penguin, and Apple had invited her to San Francisco to oversee a Whole Pantry app. A portion from each app sale, Gibson promised, would go to charity. </p> <p>The story is told here through three bitterly disappointed former acolytes: Pixie, Maxine, who was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at the age of 12, and personal trainer Kylie, a cancer patient. “The doctor said to me, ‘You need to get your affairs in order.' Give me a chance to fight it first!”</p> <p>Gibson's unmasking and downfall might be old news, but Desai's film amply demonstrates the seductive visual appeal of the wellness craze, with its artful snaps of yoga bodies and multicoloured fruit platters. Pixie and Maxine explain how, for them, the lifestyle was a fast-track to low self-worth. Keeping to the food restrictions led to lethargy, not superhealth, but when advised it was time to exercise less and eat more, Maxine insisted: “It's not the diet, it's me.”</p> <p>Journalist Richard Guilliatt, whose wife had cancer, was intrigued by Gibson, a supposed sufferer who “looked a million dollars”, and dug deeper. Face to face, the personable Gibson was curiously evasive, and an internet search revealed she had erased much of her pre-2013 activity. Gibson's deception — as well as the false cancer claims, the pledged funds for charity never materialised — is such a tricky subject that a school friend Desai manages to track down only agrees to talk on condition of anonymity. </p> <p>“She should be burnt at the stake” was a typical online comment once the truth came out. But Kylie is angrier at the publishers, TV companies, social media platforms and media outlets that validated Gibson to begin with. “I wouldn't have thought it was my responsibility to fact-check her.”</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On BBC3 from June 30 at 10.35pm</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Suzi Feay 2021 'Bad Influencer — the story of a fraudulent wellness blogger on BBC3' FT.com 25 June.
