  "text": "<p>Technology, rather than the government intervention he recommends, may quell this scourge. I haven't owned a car in 15 years and have received hundreds of warranty calls in five years. My new iPhone, instead of displaying the caller's number on the screen as in the past, now flashes a message: \"Likely Scam.\" Enough said.</p><p>Dennis Kneale</p><p>Brooklyn, N.Y.</p><p>---</p><p>There are two beneficiaries to these swindles, the thieves themselves and the carriers who grant them access to bandwidth. If caller ID is able to identify spam, why doesn't Verizon, my carrier, shut the call down? Why does my phone ring at all? How is it possible that a single source can generate thousands of calls with spoofed numbers listed that carriers are helpless to identify and shut down? Since putting one's name and number on do-not-call lists prevents nothing, the only conclusion is that the carriers are enjoying a premium from call centers that generate hundreds of thousands of calls per hour. Crocodile tears about helplessness in the face of that technology is bunk, and should be met by legislation that fines the carriers for every bogus call that leaks through; plainly, the carriers are partners in crime. The drain on American productivity is enough to require this legislation.</p><p>Perry Glasser</p><p>Haverhill, Mass.</p>",
