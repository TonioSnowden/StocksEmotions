  "text": "<p>   When Hyundai Motor Group's new chairman Chung Eui-sun took over last fall, he outlined a bold road map for a future where flying vehicles and robots make up as much business as typical gas-guzzling cars. </p><p>   A few months later, he would get a big opportunity to reshape the company along his stated design: a potential deal with Apple Inc. to build driverless cars. </p><p>   Investors cheered a promising union between Apple, the world's most valuable company, and a new Hyundai with Mr. Chung at the helm. Groomed his entire life to run the auto empire, Mr. Chung, the 50-year-old grandson of Hyundai's founder, has shirked convention, down to often changing the color on his company car -- occasionally opting for gold or navy blue -- instead of keeping the standard-issue black. He earned his M.B.A. in San Francisco during the 1990s dot-com boom and has become one of the auto industry's most outspoken technologists. </p><p>   But negotiations between the iPhone maker and Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia Corp. broke down, according to South Korean regulatory filings last week. Hyundai's discussions for self-driving cars continue with unspecified others, according to the filings. </p><p>   The failure to seal a deal shows how challenging the terrain is for Mr. Chung and Hyundai, if not the broader auto industry itself, struggling to partner up or home-brew solutions for future technologies outside the traditional lines of business. </p><p>   \"Usually the auto maker is the one who decides everything and is in control,\" said James Hong, head of mobility research at Macquarie Capital, in Seoul. \"Here, Apple's the one making the call.\" </p><p>   Global tech giants and the auto industry have been on a collision course for years. Both sides need each other, with factory-floor basics on one side and software wizardry on the other. But divvying up the spoils from potentially lucrative vehicle data has in some cases proven a sticking point, industry analysts say. </p><p>   Mr. Chung's quest to transform Hyundai, the world's fourth-largest auto maker by sales, is both professional and personal. His father, who led Hyundai for two decades, became the first South Korean named to the Automotive Hall of Fame in Michigan. But to carve out his own legacy, the younger Mr. Chung aims to turn Hyundai into more than just a car maker -- a challenge the whole auto industry faces. </p><p>   \"He knows the rules, so he knows how to be creative and where and when to push,\" said Frank Ahrens, a former vice president at Hyundai's Korean headquarters. </p><p>   Mr. Chung, through a spokeswoman, declined an interview request. Hyundai and Kia declined to comment. Apple didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   Even without a deal, the Hyundai-Apple discussions planted the flag for Mr. Chung's future ambitions. Hyundai has earmarked at least $30 billion for future technology. The company has recently forged a joint venture with Aptiv PLC on autonomous vehicles, and gained controlling interest of U.S. robotics company Boston Dynamics. Kia plans to boost electric vehicles to 40% of total production by 2030, nearly quadrupling from current levels. </p><p>   Mr. Chung, a basketball junkie and \"Top Gear\" fan, has focused on improving the company's image, rather than obsessing over wringing out costs, according to former Hyundai executives and employees. He oversaw the rollout of Hyundai's new Genesis brand, a premium rival to BMW AG and others. The conglomerate hired talent away from Audi AG and Volkswagen AG. As president of Kia in the mid-2000s, he led an effort to inject a hip image for its fleet. The company even enlisted basketball star Blake Griffin to jump over one of its cars at a slam-dunk contest in 2011. </p><p>   It modernized internally, too, swapping out cubicles for more open-office designs. </p><p>   Neither Hyundai or Apple has specified why negotiations broke down, but the potential deal had progressed far enough in the South Korean firm's eyes that Kia representatives had reached out to partners in recent weeks about a plan to assemble electric cars for Apple in Georgia, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. </p><p>   Investors sold the South Korean auto makers' shares after they disclosed the halt in talks with Apple. But Hyundai's stock remains up 27% this year, while Kia's has soared by roughly a third. In contrast, South Korea's benchmark Kospi index has increased 9% in 2021. </p><p>   Hyundai's planned corporate metamorphosis expands what the current chairman's father, Chung Mong-koo, staked out for the formerly downtrodden South Korean auto maker two decades ago. </p><p>   Once known as unreliable and cheap, Hyundai leapfrogged rivals by going beyond the traditional car-maker playbook. Others offered warranties spanning three years or 36,000 miles. Hyundai and Kia -- which set up massive plants in nonunionized Alabama and Georgia -- reached for 10 years and 100,000 miles. Lower labor costs helped the South Koreans undercut competitors on price. </p><p>   When he took over the chairmanship in October, Mr. Chung signaled further plans to update the culture of the company. \"If each and every employee thinks of oneself as a pioneer, and channel that positive energy into our growth and that of our future generations,\" Mr. Chung said in a video to employees, \"I am certain we will seize fresh opportunities out of crises.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Tim Higgins in San Francisco contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
