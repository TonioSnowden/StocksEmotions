  "title": "15 SUVs with a panoramic sunroof for under $40k; The cheapest one starts at $26,730",
  "text": "<p>One other caveat about the list: These are just the SUVs with panoramic glass roofs, i.e. multiple-row-spanning glass roofs, not the more common (but still great) single-row sunroofs or multiple individual sunroofs.</p><p>1. 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer</p><p>Price with panoramic sunroof: $26,730</p><p>To get the panoramic-roof version of the 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer, you'll have to tick the box for the LT's $1,770 Sun and Liftgate Package, as well as the $520 Convenience Package and the $145 Confidence II Package. Along with the panoramic sunroof, you'll get a hands-free rear liftgate, automatic climate control with cabin humidity sensor, rear park assist, and more.</p><p>2. 2022 Kia Sportage</p><p>Price with panoramic sunroof: $28,090</p><p>Getting a panoramic sunroof as standard equipment in the 2022 Kia KR:000270 Sportage is as easy as selecting the Nightfall Edition. At a starting price of $28,090, the Nightfall is the least expensive way to get a panoramic glass roof in the 2022 Sportage. Those shopping for a new Sportage may notice that the all-new 2023 Kia Sportage is now available, but the 2022 model, if you can find it, still offers great value.</p><p>3. 2022 Subaru Forester</p><p>Price with panoramic sunroof: $28,895</p><p>A power panoramic moonroof is standard on all variants of the 2022 Subaru FUJHY Forester except for the base model, meaning you'll have to step up to the $28,895 2022 Forester Premium (or a higher trim) to get the expansive glass roof.</p><p>Check out: The 2022 Honda CR-V or the 2022 Subaru Forester: Which is better?</p><p>4. 2022 Volkswagen Taos</p><p>Price with panoramic sunroof: $29,095</p><p>The Volkswagen XE:VOW Taos is all-new for 2022.

Not bad for a compact SUV that also offers 3-row seating in some configurations.</p><p>6. 2022 Jeep Renegade</p><p>Price with panoramic sunroof: $31,440</p><p>Like the Forester, the 2022 Jeep Renegade offers a powered panoramic sunroof on every model except the base Sport model.
