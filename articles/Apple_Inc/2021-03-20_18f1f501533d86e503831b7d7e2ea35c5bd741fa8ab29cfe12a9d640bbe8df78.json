  "text": "<p>Edna Lewis recalled that the first salad of spring during her Virginia childhood “consisted of scallions or young onion plants, before they had reached the bulb stage, and Simpson, a tender kind of lettuce”. Lewis&#xa0;— <a href=\"https://www.kinfolk.com/edna-lewis/\">author of <em>The&#xa0;Taste of Country Cooking</em></a>, one of the great American cookbooks — was born in 1916, the grandchild of an emancipated slave, in a small farming settlement called Freetown where everything her family ate was freshly made and linked to the seasons. She later said that her life's mission was “to try to recapture those good flavours of the past”.</p> <p>Her&#xa0;spring salad was one of those forgotten flavours: the freshest of spring onions and lettuce, simply washed and dressed with sugar, vinegar and salt, but no oil. Lewis recalled that she and her seven siblings loved this dish so much that they would save it to eat last “so that we could spoon lots of dressing onto our plates”. While the young green onions were available, her family ate it every day until sometime in late April or early May when they became “too tough to use”.</p> <p>Spring onions — or scallions, to give them their American name — really were a spring vegetable once. These days, it can seem like a misnomer. There isn't a month of the year when spring onions are not in the shops. Whatever the season, they are always nestling unobtrusively in the salad aisle, near the radishes and celery. Sometimes, they are boringly labelled “salad onions”, as if there were no other use for them. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b69f0b2-68b7-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">asparagus</a>, which gains prestige through the shortness of its season, no one heralds the spring onion. But to me, they are still deserving of their name because no other vegetable tastes quite so much like green shoots of hope. Whether you eat them in April or December, they add something springlike to the plate. They are also good for impatient cooks because they soften more quickly than regular onions in stews or risottos. </p> <p>Spring onions might be the most underrated of all vegetables, at least in the west. Most of the time, we hardly even consider them in their own right, rather than as a mere garnish. Yet for the price, I feel that no other vegetable can delight in quite so many ways. Served chopped and raw, spring onions are like an onion in soft focus, with some of the pungent edges blurred away. But if you keep them whole and cook them, their character transforms. They go as silky and sugary-sweet as leeks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.countrylife.co.uk/gardens/gardening-tips/alliums-what-to-grow-and-how-to-grow-them-from-elephant-garlic-to-babingtons-leek-219182\">Mark Diacono</a> — the author of <em>Herb: A Cook's Companion</em> — tells me that he enjoys the fresh, bright flavour of spring onions because they are “less harsh than a regular onion” but have “more oomph than a chive”. He likes to add them to chopped eggs with a mix of green herbs, or to season a very green Greek herb pie made with filo pastry. Diacono points out that unlike many other vegetables such as green beans, spring onions can be homegrown in the UK for most of the year. They are harvested in Worcestershire, one of the main growing areas, from March to November.</p>  <p><strong>But what exactly is a spring onion?</strong> For years, I had been confused about the difference between green onions, spring onions and scallions. The confusing part is, first, there is no difference and, second, that a “spring onion” can actually refer to a whole family of different green onions, all in the allium family. According to Alan Davidson in <em>The Oxford Companion to Food</em>: “Most of the spring onions grown in the West are simply immature plants which, if left in the ground . . . would develop into full-sized onions.” The majority sold in Britain are — like the ones Edna Lewis relished during her childhood — just white onions that haven't yet turned into bulbs. But&#xa0;“spring onion” also sometimes refers to the long green bunching onions of Asia — allium fistulosum — which grow in clusters and never form a bulb, no matter how long they stay in the ground. Sometimes these are called Welsh onions — this actually has nothing to do with Wales and comes from the Anglo-Saxon word “welise”, meaning “foreign”.</p> <p>Whichever kind you buy, spring onions will have hollow tubular green leaves and a white bulb (unless you have managed to find a bunch of red scallions with a purple root, in which case, lucky you). You can tell whether your spring onion is an immature bulb onion (allium cepa) or a mature bunching one (allium fistulosum) by looking more closely at the leaves. Cut a leaf open in cross section. If the layers look circular, then it is a bunching onion. If the layers look flattened inside, then it is a young version of a regular onion.</p> <p>To see these little spring onions in a new light, try barbecuing them whole or charring them in a hot cast-iron skillet. It is a revelation to see how quickly their flavour evolves from strong to sweet. In Catalonia, a kind of spring onion called <em>calçots</em> are barbecued and eaten with a heady romesco sauce made from hazelnuts, almonds, smoky dried peppers and tomatoes. When&#xa0;eating these <em>calçots</em>, you slip off the charred outer layer “like pulling off an evening glove”, as restaurateur Gabrielle Hamilton memorably observed, and dip each one in the romesco sauce. Pre-pandemic, Catalans would meet for sociable <em>calçotadas</em> in early spring — parties revolving around cooking <em>calçots</em> over an open fire.</p> <p>But you can still have an onion party by yourself. A single bunch is the perfect portion for one. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat on the hob and cook the onions for about 10 minutes, turning with tongs until evenly charred. When they are soft, wrap them in newspaper for another 10 minutes to allow them to rest before devouring with toast and romesco (<a href=\"https://boroughmarket.org.uk/recipes/calcots-romesco-sauce\">there's a good recipe</a> from Jenny Chandler on the Borough Market website). This charring technique works best with spring onions that are not too big.</p> <p>The vegetable varies hugely in size, which reflects not just the variety but the stage at which they are harvested. The long bouquets of green onions sold in Chinese and Korean food shops tend to be larger and more bulbous than the little finger-width ones that are standard in British supermarkets. These fatter, juicier spring onions with their slippery layers lend themselves to being cut lengthwise into fine julienne strips and dropped into cold water, where they will not only lose some of their pungency but curl up delightfully. Spring onion curls are an excellent thing to add at the last minute to a salad or any number of stir-fry dishes.</p>  <p><strong>Without spring onions</strong> — ginger's essential companion — Chinese cuisine is unimaginable. <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2021/02/10/top-chef-ching-he-huang-shares-her-asian-food-tips-14052037/\">Food writer Ching-He Huang</a> tells me that they give not just a “sweet oniony bite” but the crucial element of balance to a dish. She asks me to imagine eating Peking duck without the finely sliced cucumbers and spring onions cutting through the delicious fattiness. Huang points out that spring onions have been used in China since the Han dynasty of 202BC-AD220. Back then, they were used to prepare meaty stews or “geng”. They are still used, Huang says, as a kind of culinary disinfectant to dispel “xing wei”, meaning “the raw-meaty flavours in meat, fish and seafood”.</p> <p>Huang's latest book, <em>Asian Green: Everyday plant-based recipes inspired by the East</em>, is teeming with spring onions in one form or another: she makes savoury pancakes studded with them and sautés them sweetly with carrots and spinach to serve with noodles. One of my favourite recipes in the book is a ginger and spring onion-infused oil: a paste of ginger, red chilli and spring onion mixed with sesame oil and soy sauce. Huang describes this as a Chinese answer to salsa verde — a verdant seasoning to make almost any dish taste springlike.</p> <p>Spring onions are considered so special in China that there was once a tradition of sending a child for their first day of school with a bunch of them to bring good luck (a bit like the American tradition of an apple for the teacher). I was told this by Georgine Leung, a nutritionist who grew up in Hong Kong. Leung explains that in mainland China, spring onions are associated with intelligence, partly because the word for spring onion — transliterated as “cong” or “ts'ung” — sounds like one of the Chinese words for “clever”.</p> <p>As well as being a food, they have also long been seen as a medicine. Leung notes that in ancient Chinese medical texts, they were touted as a treatment for a range of conditions, from fevers to digestive issues. Interestingly, Leung says that the different parts of the onion are seen in Chinese medicine to have different properties — the root being “spicy” and “moderate” and the green parts “warm”. Huang confirms this, saying that the white part is considered more potent and “yang” and this carries over into the way that the different parts are used in cooking. “We tend to use white in cooking, then green in&#xa0;garnish.”</p> <p>One of the saddest instructions you will ever see in a cookbook is the advice to discard all the green part of a spring onion and use only the white. This is completely missing the point. To borrow from Booker T and the MGs, these are green onions. If you throw away the top parts, how can you make an Irish champ, in which mashed potatoes are enhanced with flecks of green onions and lots of butter? Except for the root and the very tips of the green, which may be tough, the whole thing is good to use. Even the trimmings can enhance a stock.</p> <p>My very favourite spring onion recipe is also one of the simplest I have come across. Like the spring salad, it comes from Edna Lewis, who calls it “Skillet Scallions” and recommends serving it with veal kidneys or steak. For four people, you take four bunches of spring onions, trim the roots and tops to fit a medium-sized frying pan and wash them, leaving any clinging water as it helps them to steam. You heat three tablespoons of butter in the pan and, as soon as it foams, add the onions in a single layer. Cover with a lid for three minutes before turning them. After a minute or so more, they will be done. Lewis comments that “the white part should be a bit crisp, the&#xa0;tops tender, shiny, and green”. She insists that no salt is needed. I was sceptical on this last point but she is right, as usual. They are like an oniony bouquet of spring and nothing you could add would improve them. </p> <p><em>Bee Wilson is a food writer and author of “The Way We Eat Now”</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Bee Wilson 2021 'Why spring onions deserve their name' FT.com 20 March.
