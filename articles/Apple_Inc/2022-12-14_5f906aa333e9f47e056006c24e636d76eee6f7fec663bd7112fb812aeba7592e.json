  "title": "Technology:  New Instagram Feature  Mimics Rival BeReal  With Unpolished Look  ----  By Cordilia James",
  "text": "<p>   Polished is out and authentic is in among social-media users -- and Instagram is taking note. </p><p>   The photo-sharing app owned by Meta Platforms Inc. is giving its users new ways to share and connect with friends, including one feature that might look familiar to users of BeReal, the popular social-media app. </p><p>   Candid Stories, which Instagram began testing in South Africa Tuesday, gives users a daily notification to snap and share two unfiltered photos using the front and back camera lenses -- not unlike the prompts sent by BeReal, which has recently amassed millions of users. Instagram didn't say when or whether Candid Stories will roll out globally. </p><p>   Another new feature -- called Notes, friend-focused status updates that appear at the top of the inbox -- began rolling out to all users Tuesday. </p><p>   Instagram's updates come as young people flock to newer apps such as BeReal and TikTok. They also address some recent criticism that Instagram posts often feel overly curated or inauthentic, with ads and sponsored content squeezing out updates from friends. </p><p>   BeReal, which launched in 2020, has become popular marketing itself to younger people as an authentic, unfiltered alternative to the curated posts found on Instagram and TikTok. </p><p>   At a random time each day, users are asked to take a front-and-back shot and submit it. Any posts that show up two minutes after the prompt are noted as late when viewed by others. </p><p>   BeReal has been installed 73.7 million times from its launch to Dec. 11, according to Sensor Tower, which tracks app-performance metrics. The app topped Apple's App Store earlier this year, though its growth has slowed in recent months, Sensor Tower said. </p><p>   Instagram's Candid Stories still prompts users once a day and includes a time stamp so friends know when you posted. </p><p>   Unlike BeReal, however, users can enhance their daily posts with text or squiggles, and can opt out of the daily alert whenever they like. (They also aren't marked tardy.) </p><p>   Instagram previously enabled the dual-camera function, which simultaneously uses front and back lenses. </p><p>   More than two billion people use Instagram every month, Meta says. The app and its parent company have faced concerns about their impact on younger users. At the same time, some users -- including the celebrities that long championed the platform -- have urged the company to \"make Instagram Instagram again\" by giving priority to friends' posts over paid ones. </p><p>   The new features are intended to give users more ways to engage with people they know, said Tessa Lyons-Laing, director of product management at Instagram. </p><p>   Notes -- the only announced feature now hitting the app -- lets users share their thoughts in a 60-character text post with close friends or people who follow them back. The note appears at the top of recipients' inboxes and invites them to respond before it disappears in 24 hours. </p><p></p>",
