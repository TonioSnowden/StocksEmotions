Inflation will also be higher than originally forecast at 7 per cent for 2023, a slight improvement on the 9.3 per cent expected this year. </p></li>  <li><p>China eased coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/709e95e6-cc63-4fe0-9c4a-5683c87f7e7b\">quarantine restrictions</a> for close contacts and international travellers in the first signs of a softening of its zero-Covid strategy. The manufacturing hub Guangzhou however is on the brink of a citywide lockdown.</p></li>  <li><p>The crypto market faces a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0fa4f3b6-213c-4e76-bcd9-fcf184a264a2\">2008-style financial crisis</a>, according to the head of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, a point echoed by US editor-at-large <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2b60629-953c-4fd8-bebf-2a0c78ecfe4b\">Gillian Tett</a>. Binance's rival FTX, previously valued $32bn, has filed for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afe56c4e-2d68-457e-bbb2-476752d5f02e\">bankruptcy</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/931550d3-db2c-4c56-8277-b581afe409da\"><em>live blog</em></a></p>  <p>Good evening.</p> <p>“I am under no illusion that there is a tough road ahead.”</p> <p>That was the reaction of chancellor Jeremy Hunt to news this morning that the UK economy had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3dd140d2-a2a7-4882-b832-96950c3fb661\">shrunk more than expected</a>, highlighting the challenge he faces ahead of his landmark statement on the public finances of a nation teetering on the edge of recession.</p> <p>GDP fell 0.6 per cent between August and September, while output dropped 0.2 per cent between the second and third quarter, the first three-monthly decline since February 2020. This leaves the UK economy, unlike its peers, smaller than before the pandemic. </p> <p>The Bank of England has already forecast that the third quarter would be the start of a long recession thanks to tighter financial conditions and the squeeze on household budgets from surging prices.</p> <p>There are also ominous signs in the labour market, an area where the government has been keen to trumpet its success. New analysis suggests the UK will be the only developed economy with employment still below <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/650a0b9b-026f-4c2f-ad75-37a6202ea8fe\">pre-pandemic levels</a> at the start of 2023. A new “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a7b0ef7-d3be-4af6-b393-27900366bd40\">winter of discontent</a>” is also looming as more public sector workers — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62263ae7-e2dd-4583-b28c-10f0f1656a17\">nurses are the latest</a> — demand pay rises in line with inflation.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11780782.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Hunt meanwhile is casting around for ways of filling the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3317b16-be1c-464b-a289-db6af2df1f0e\">£55bn budgetary hole</a> as he prepares for his big moment on November 17 in what could be, as former top government official <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f0243f7b-ce02-4125-a04d-0319cb3b9767\">Nicholas Macpherson</a> sees it, a return to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e840d2a7-b5a1-4bd7-9c2f-43d7587d9f19\">Treasury orthodoxy</a>.</p> <p>About half is set to be filled by spending cuts, ushering in what former Bank of England official Charlie Bean dubbed “Austerity 2.0”. Other potential measures include a delay in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8b0ea6e-a161-46ed-8cdc-5aad21d2d06e\">social care reforms</a>, a freeze in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3698777-99a1-4165-9d9d-be11b421c073\">income tax thresholds</a> and a stealth raid on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cb99420-13a4-4ecd-b06d-16d812377a57\">inheritance tax</a>. (And if you think you could balance the books yourself, have a go at our “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acbddf57-17d3-4aed-bfcd-34162da18d95\">fill the black hole</a>” interactive.)</p> <p>Ultimately, says economics editor Chris Giles, Hunt has to choose between <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f0d630a-4e2a-4589-9de3-f05dfea7329e\">politics and economics</a>. </p> <p>Immediate tax rises and spending cuts may put the country's finances in better position later this decade, but that's when the opposition Labour party is likely to be in power. Deferring action could minimise the immediate pain and mean Labour inherits weak public finances, but runs the risk of falling foul of financial markets. And, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2865a87-4080-4da6-8929-c9222d9430b8\">recent history</a> shows us, that is not a good position to be in.</p> <p><em>FT Schools is hosting a free economics webinar on Monday with senior FT journalists and guests covering topics from green energy to government budgets and Brexit.
