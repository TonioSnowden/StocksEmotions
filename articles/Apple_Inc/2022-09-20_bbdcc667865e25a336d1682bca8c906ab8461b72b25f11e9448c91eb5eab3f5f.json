  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 408 points, or 1.3%, to 30,610, after dropping nearly 459 points at its session low.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 52 points, or 1.4%, at 3,847.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP declined 118 points, or 1%, to 11,416.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The next Federal Open Market Committee decision is looming over the market, as investors grapple not just with whether the central bank will make a 75 basis point rate hike or lift rates by 100 points, but also how high the Fed will signal rates will go in the future. The meeting starts Tuesday and ends Wednesday.</p><p>Monday's market action was without conviction, where stocks opened lower yet closed higher on the least volume since Aug. 29. But markets appeared headed lower on Tuesday, as stocks took their cues from rising Treasury yields.</p><p>\"Volumes remain light and the mood cautious, with few looking to take on large positions before hearing what the Fed says and where policymakers see rates going by the end of the hiking cycle,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, in a note. \"This is what will drive the markets, not the rate hike tomorrow, but what the Fed plans to do next.\"</p><p>Need to Know: There's only one 'perfect asset' to fight all the bad news that could be coming, says this strategist</p><p>Meanwhile, Treasury yields, which move opposite to price, continued to march higher, with the rate on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y jumping 6.9 basis points to 3.54% after ending Monday at its highest since 2011. The yield on the 2-year note BX:TMUBMUSD02Y continued to press toward the 4% threshold.
