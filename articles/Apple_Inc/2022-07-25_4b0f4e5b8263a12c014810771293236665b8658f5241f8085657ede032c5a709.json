  "text": "<p>The Pacific Palisades property is asking significantly more than its last sale price of $25.5 million a year ago. Known as Valley Farm, the seven-bedroom estate spans about 10,000 square feet, including the main house, a two-story pool house and a small guesthouse being used as a gym, all built in farmhouse style.</p><p>The bomb shelter, which is built into a rock formation in a separate structure, dates to the 1950s, when the original home on the property was built, said owner Rita DeLeone, 64. In 2012, that house was largely demolished and rebuilt, but the bomb shelter was preserved and converted into a wine storage area.</p><p>Ms. DeLeone formerly worked in corporate hospitality and lives primarily in Texas. She said she was helped with the purchase by a wealthy \"significant other,\" whom she declined to name.</p><p>\"He's a very generous person,\" she said. \"He has afforded me what I never could have imagined. All my girlfriends call me Cinderella.\"</p><p>Originally from Ohio, Ms. DeLeone said she was shopping for a property in the Los Angeles area to be closer to her son, a film editor and producer who lives in the Marina del Rey area. For the past year, she has been splitting her time between Pacific Palisades and another home she owns in Woodlands, Texas, she said.</p><p>Located at the edge of Will Rogers State Historic Park, Valley Farm sits on more than an acre, with a pool, vegetable garden, fruit orchards, batting cage and bocce court, Mr. Gambino said.</p><p>Finished largely with bright white interiors, the estate has a library, a music room and a study, Mr. Gambino said. The main house has a London-style bar with plaid fabric walls, and a wood-paneled dining room with a large stone fireplace.</p><p>Ms. DeLeone said she was drawn to the property because it reminded her of visiting strawberry fields and apple orchards near her childhood home in Ohio, then going home and making pie. She said she has done significant work to the property, including installing a new pool and spa and building a new motor court that allows for additional parking. In the garden, she installed a series of swings for her grandchildren, who think of the property as akin to Disneyland, she said.</p><p>Ms. DeLeone said she is selling the property because, as much as she loves it, it is too large. \"It's a bit much for me,\" she said.</p><p>Mr. Gambino said the value of the property has increased significantly over the past year, thanks to the improvements Ms. DeLeone has made as well as an increase in demand for properties near the ocean. He cited a recent sale in which Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine sold a Pacific Palisades home for $51 million after buying it in 2018 for $31.95 million.</p><p>Write to Katherine Clarke at Katherine.Clarke@wsj.com</p><p>This $37.5 Million L.A.
