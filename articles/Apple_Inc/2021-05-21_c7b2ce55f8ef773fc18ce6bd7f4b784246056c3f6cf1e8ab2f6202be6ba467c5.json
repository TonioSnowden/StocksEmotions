  "text": "<p>Last weekend, our friend's son celebrated his 17th birthday. </p> <p>Usually, we stuff a £20 note inside a card. However, the pandemic's erasure of cash as a payment method in central London means that he would probably <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd4a803a-bf79-4d39-89c8-b259f106a2e7\">struggle to spend it</a>. My husband suggested an Amazon voucher instead. Not the most thought-provoking present — but would £20 worth of <em>shares</em> in Amazon be a better idea?</p> <p>An educational gift with a twist, this prospect moved a step closer in the US this week, with Fidelity's launch of a <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/go/youth-account/overview\">“youth account</a>” for 13- to 17-year-old investors. The wonders of fractional share ownership mean teen traders can buy $1 stakes in around 7,000 US-listed securities, including big brands such as Apple, Facebook, Netflix and Amazon, as well as a range of ETFs and Fidelity's own funds. </p> <p>Youth accounts have to be linked to a parental account, but you can only monitor the trading prowess of your teenagers from afar. They call the shots via an app on their phone, and could squander their birthday money in a matter of minutes. The traditional adolescent-parent battleground of, “You're not going out dressed like that” could soon be replaced by, “You're not going all out in GameStop!”</p> <p>Nevertheless, I think trading accounts for teens are an idea that the rest of the investment industry will be watching closely — and parents should take it very seriously too. During the pandemic, there has been a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7e52d87-0b0d-44ef-bed9-72e66a1f14ee\">surge of interest</a> from investors in their late teens and twenties who are old enough to set up their own trading or brokerage accounts.</p> <p>From a financial literacy perspective, this is potentially encouraging. However, many young investors have been drawn towards the most speculative areas of the market, trading in and out of “meme stocks” like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/3c1fa744-9de0-4398-a6cc-16e430d8a8dd\">GameStop and AMC</a>, dabbling with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3df7bdb0-2c87-478f-bc3c-636a73a73712\">spread betting</a> and buying <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be796d33-a5e7-4753-98a8-b586f1680d58\">cryptocurrencies.</a></p> <p>For a generation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c58f5522-e58f-4f3d-b4b9-9a4ea62a74a1\">priced out </a>of the property market, these kinds of gambles present an alluring short-cut to a housing deposit. Yet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4c29bb3-c8ee-454c-a2dd-eac9f644007f\">wild swings</a> in the price of Bitcoin this week show that “get rich quick” can easily turn into “get broke fast” — something that could put them off investing for life. Could teaching them how to “get richer slowly” from an earlier age be a better way of passing on valuable life lessons? </p> <p>Sam, a 20-something crypto trader who features in an upcoming episode of the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/money-clinic-with-claer-barrett\">Money Clinic podcast</a> put all of his savings into various coins. With hopes of doubling or trebling his money fading fast, Sam said one of the reasons he had risked putting his cash in an unregulated asset class was the ease of learning about how to do it online. </p> <p>He showed me an array of social media content and YouTube crypto webinars, all tailored for a younger audience. He was capable of assessing the investment case for different coins, and closely followed what hedge fund managers were investing in. Yet the thought of starting anything so dull as a pension or conventional brokerage account had never occurred to him. “I've never been told anything about regular finance or investing before,” he said.</p> <p>Talking to teenagers about anything is notoriously difficult, but a bit of money could pique their interest. In the UK, parents can now save up to £9,000 per year per child into a tax-free investment account called a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d3c7d6-57b3-44a4-90e5-985a9a1886a8\">Junior Isa</a> (Jisa for short). The majority of investment providers offer them, although parents have full control. With annual investment growth of 6 per cent, funding the full £9,000 allowance each year from birth could result in a total pot of around £300,000 by the time your child turns 18. </p> <p>At this point, control of the account legally passes to the teen — a fact that makes many British parents extremely fearful. Yet statistics show that the majority of 18-year-olds keep the money invested when they come of age. One way parents could alleviate their fears is by involving teens in managing the money and helping decide where their portfolio is invested. Even if they're not money mad, talking about how their investments could be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db62fea4-29c3-4a93-9478-bae721bbefe6\">affected by climate change</a> is a way of engaging them. </p> <p>Having their own money at stake brings a new dimension to learning about the magic of compound interest, riding out volatile markets, the dangers of trading too frequently and how high fees erode investment performance. Although single-stock investing is riskier, getting them to investigate the top 10 holdings of different funds is a great way of fostering a wider interest in business and economics, and could even help them fathom where to build their future career. </p> <p>And don't forget, 16- to 19-year-old students anywhere in the world can get free access to FT.com through the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/dc4eb395-7eaa-4cea-a0c8-4ad46ec26347\">FT Schools</a> programme.
