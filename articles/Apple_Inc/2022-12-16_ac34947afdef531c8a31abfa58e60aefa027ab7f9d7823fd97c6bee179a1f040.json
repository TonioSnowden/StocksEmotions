  "title": "China's Pro-Business Shift May Prove Fickle; U.S. regulator's successful push to review work of Chinese auditors adds to signs that Beijing wants to shed bad-for-business reputation",
  "text": "<p>A letter from Terry Gou, the founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, was a key factor behind Beijing's sudden shift away from its draconian set of zero-Covid policies. The Politburo last week explicitly named buttressing foreign investors' sentiment as a key priority. And Chinese ride-hailing company Didi, under a more-or-less unrelenting regulatory assault since mid-2021, may soon be permitted back into domestic app stores.</p><p>The change in tone—and news on audits in particular—is obviously very positive for U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba.</p><p>But the fact that the shift in orientation has been so abrupt and wide-ranging, and so obviously executed under steep economic and social pressure, raises obvious questions. Most important: Does all this represent a real sea change in the leadership's thinking, or more of a tactical adjustment? If the latter, then it could be vulnerable to a reversal once the economy and public health situation stabilize.</p><p>The announcement by the PCAOB itself is significant, but not necessarily the end of the long-running game of chicken between Chinese and U.S. regulators. The apparently unfettered access the PCAOB's inspectors were given to the records of eight U.S. listed Chinese companies—including Alibaba and, according to the PCAOB, state owned-companies—at two Chinese auditors sets a strong precedent. It also resets the three-year delisting \"clock\" mandated by Congress for Chinese companies such as Alibaba using previously uninspected Chinese auditors.</p><p>As the world has just witnessed, however, three years can be a very long time in the Sino-U.S. relationship.</p><p>More broadly, it is worth remembering that China's current leader Xi Jinping was once regarded as a possible reformer who had vowed to allow a decisive role for markets in the economy. In the long-ago days of late 2014 and early 2015, state media routinely talked up the stock market, leading to a huge embarrassment for Mr. Xi when the margin-fueled stock bubble collapsed in mid 2015. It was only after the disastrous stock, bond and foreign-exchange ructions of 2015 that more heavy-handed state-centric policies like so-called mixed ownership reform and supply-side structural reform—code for forced mergers led by the state and forced closures of small private industrial companies—became much more prominent.</p><p>In other words, Mr. Xi has changed tack before—either opportunistically or because he perceived the real challenges facing the country and the economy to be changing. As investors evaluate this latest sudden effusion of warmth, they should keep that in mind.</p><p>Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com</p><p>China's Pro-Business Shift May Prove Fickle</p>",
