  "text": "<p>It has now been six months since FT Edit launched in the UK, so what have we learned? </p> <p>You told us you like the clean design of the app and its range of topics (some of you were surprised to find these kinds of articles in the FT!)</p> <p>You like the way we only pick eight articles a day and said the app feels manageable, rather than endless. (On average, you are reading just under four articles a week.)</p> <p>We want to give you deep, unbiased analysis of the big news of the day, as well as something delightful to read when you are relaxing. But some of you are a bit confused by how, and why, we choose our articles. </p> <p>Happily, we will be rolling out some improvements soon. </p> <p>You can now read the app when you are offline, and we have an iPad version on the way. We are also looking at changes to the homepage to explain our curation more clearly. And we want to build more audio, video and visual journalism into the app. </p> <p>Meanwhile, we asked our data analyst Aru to tell us what stories were the most, and least, popular over the past six months. </p> <h2>What you liked the most:</h2> <p>An ode to introverts everywhere by Pilita Clark <br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d5942a2-a13a-49ea-a833-a6d5ce780ae3\"><strong>It's OK to be quiet in meetings</strong></a></p> <p>Stephen Bush on the delicate politics of restaurant tips<br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdec78c4-2d5a-4252-bf1b-27fc2f77ea4c\"><strong>Want to understand 21st century power? Look at PizzaExpress</strong></a><br><br>Three views on marriage, from “men suck” to “slowly unfolding apocalypse”<br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c43dcf4-f055-4985-86c1-f3b5403a6d4c\"><strong>Marriage in all its divine tedium</strong></a><br><br>A security guard's illuminating first-person essay on the cost of living crisis:<br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af633a2e-3e46-4eaa-9173-167b87dc8c3e\"><strong>I earn £10.71 an hour. Here's what the cost of living crisis is like</strong></a></p> <p>Frank insight from the FT's innovation editor on starting his own business<br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6153cc9b-fe18-4bcd-8583-4f54d6340497\"><strong>Seven lessons from a late-starting entrepreneur</strong></a></p> <h2>What you don't like:</h2> <p>We're not going to name and shame the worst performing articles; our journalists' egos might never recover. </p> <p>But in general, it seems that you have less time for foreign affairs, the arts and fashion (apart from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f49cc5f-dacb-47d3-8112-baa26b18fa2b\">watches</a>. You like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c68c88fb-fa38-4fcf-a6f1-b3d88f6256a8\">watches</a>.)</p> <p>“I love seeing how our readers' interests cover such a wide range of subjects,” said Aru. But he added that you “really don't like gardening, gaming or — surprisingly — space exploration.” </p> <p>(We still think <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f50fba1d-5f03-4035-8302-535319f9338c\">this piece</a> on space stations is amazing though.)</p> <h1>Our favourite pieces this week</h1> <p>• One of our goals in the FT Edit team is to give you “news you can use” — great articles that help you navigate the tricky times we are in. And with the turmoil in the markets this week, and soaring mortgage rates, this article on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0acec9c1-00ca-48a6-b565-b10688b240cf\">what to do with your savings</a> was essential. (If you have any savings left, given the cost of living crisis . . .)<br><strong>Malcolm Moore</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalcolmMoore\"><em>(@malcolmmoore)</em></a> <br><em>Editor, FT Edit</em></p> <p>• There's been only one story in town this week, and it's not a good one. But as the financial markets collapse around us, there's nothing that boosts the mood quite like playing IRL claw-grabber arcade games thousands of miles away in an Israeli warehouse from the comfort of your own sofa, amirite? Your stuffed prize will even be delivered to your door. This is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5aedb42-8ab6-40d3-bbfb-6ac8112e4c15\">premise of Clawee</a>, a wildly popular mobile phone game. If it sounds utterly bonkers, it's because it is.<br><strong>Hannah Rock</strong><br><em>Deputy editor, FT Edit</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HannahRockFT\"><em>(@HannahRockFT)</em></a> </p> <h1>Something to listen to </h1> <p><strong>Money Clinic — </strong>Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's “mini” Budget was anything but.
