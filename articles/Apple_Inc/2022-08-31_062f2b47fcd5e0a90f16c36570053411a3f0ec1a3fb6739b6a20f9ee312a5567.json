  "title": "China's Economic Woes Drag On With Factory Disruptions, Property Slump; Extreme weather and power shortages depressed manufacturing, while home sales fell for the 14th consecutive month",
  "text": "<p>Prolonged weakness in China's economy is impeding an engine of global growth as major economies face pressure from inflation and the impact of the Ukraine war. Weak demand within China also spells trouble for multinationals such as Apple Inc. and Starbucks Corp., which count on China's appetite for a range of goods from raw materials to smartphones and coffee for profit growth.</p><p>China showed signs of a nascent recovery in June, after pandemic restrictions were lifted in the financial hub of Shanghai, but that recovery has lost steam in the months since. A resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the past month has triggered fresh lockdowns in Chinese cities.</p><p>The official manufacturing purchasing managers index edged up to 49.4 in August from 49 in July, China's National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday, exceeding the median forecast of 49.2 among economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. A score of above 50 indicates an expansion in the manufacturing sector; below 50, a decline.</p><p>China's \"recovery is still not on solid footing,\" Barclays economists Yingke Zhou and Jian Chang wrote in a note to clients after Wednesday's data was released.</p><p>The power crunch brought on by the heat wave depressed factory activity and forced global manufacturers including Foxconn Technology Group and car makers Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG to temporarily halt production.</p><p>Separately, new data released Wednesday showed the property market is still trying to find a bottom, with home sales tumbling for the 14th consecutive month.</p><p>Sales at the country's top 100 property developers fell more than 30% from the same month last year, to the equivalent of about $75 billion, or 519 billion yuan, according to data released Wednesday by China Real Estate Information Corp., an industry data provider. Compared with July, August sales slipped 0.8%.</p><p>Beijing unexpectedly lowered two key interest rates in mid-August, and the State Council, China's cabinet, announced a $146 billion stimulus package to shore up growth. Still, many economists expect business investment and consumer spending to remain depressed, as China's stimulus is largely focused around infrastructure spending and the country remains reluctant to budge from its zero-Covid policy, which has amplified uncertainties for companies and hurt consumer confidence.</p><p>Chinese leaders have signaled they are prepared for lower growth this year. At a key political meeting in July, Chinese policy makers effectively abandoned a growth target of about 5.5%, set earlier this year.</p><p>China's statistics bureau also said Wednesday that China's nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 52.6 in August from 53.8 in July. The spread of the coronavirus and bad weather held back growth in both services and construction activity in August, it added.</p><p>The services sector represented 53% of China's gross domestic product in 2021, and sluggishness there doesn't bode well for the economy, economists from ANZ said. The bank cut China's full-year GDP growth to 3% from 4% after Wednesday's data release, citing weakening demand at home and abroad.</p><p>The country's strategy of resorting to sudden lockdowns to contain Covid-19 continues to hinder growth. In the past month, Covid flare-ups in dozens of cities have led to mass testing and closure of entertainment and business venues.</p><p>Authorities in Shenzhen, a wealthy technology hub in southern China that is home to Tencent Holdings Ltd., shut down an electronics wholesale market this week. In the port city of Tianjin, schools pushed back their reopening after summer vacation as local authorities required more than 13 million residents to undergo mass testing after dozens of Covid cases were detected.</p><p>A total of 41 cities, which account for about a third of China's GDP, are in the midst of outbreaks, the highest since April, according to research firm Capital Economics.</p><p>This Covid containment strategy also affected multinational companies, many of which were forced into factory stoppages earlier in the year.</p><p>A recent survey of member companies by the U.S.-China Business Council found business confidence in China had fallen to the lowest since the business group began the poll more than 16 years ago, largely driven by Beijing's continued use of abrupt Covid-19 lockdowns.</p><p>Unlike past slowdowns, when Chinese exports helped cushion a weaker economy, exports will provide less of a lifeline this time, economists said. Decades-high inflation and tightened monetary policy in the U.S. and other developed economies have crimped consumer spending, they said.</p><p>\"I can't think of any engine of growth going forward,\" said Alicia García Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, who recently lowered her full-year China growth forecast to 3% from 3.5%.</p><p>Already, there are signs that global demand for Chinese goods is waning. A subindex tracking China's new export orders contracted for the 16th month in a row in August, Wednesday's data shows.</p><p>Even so, economists expect further disruption to factory operations to be limited, as temperatures have started to fall in China's central Sichuan province. China's state media said Wednesday that most of the power supply for industrial and commercial usage has been restored this week. The stimulus measures announced by Chinese policy makers last week, which include bank credit to launch infrastructure projects, should also support economic growth, they said.</p><p>Meanwhile, China's faltering real-estate market continues to drag on its economy.</p><p>Average home prices in dozens of cities have fallen since September last year with no clear sign of recovery.</p><p>On Wednesday, the chairman of one of the country's leading real-estate companies, China Vanke Co., said a mortgage revolt during the summer—in which many buyers of unfinished apartments threatened to stop paying their home loans—hurt demand for housing.</p><p>The protest movement was \"a blow to consumers' confidence,\" Yu Liang, Vanke's chairman, said on a conference call discussing the company's results. The developer, like many of its peers, has reported drops in contracted sales this year, but managed to post an increase in first-half profit. Mr. Yu said the property market had shrunk so much that a rebound is inevitable.</p><p>A day earlier, another large Chinese developer, Country Garden Holdings Co., posted a steep decline in profits. The company said China's property market has \"slid rapidly into severe depression.\"</p><p>Property sales remain low on expectations that prices will keep dropping, as well as fears that more cash-strapped developers could fail to complete construction of apartments.</p><p>A prolonged property slowdown raises the risk that the weakness in the sector may spill over to the broader economy, hurting job growth and denting household consumption.</p><p>China's property market is expected to only \"muddle through\" the second half of this year, Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients last week.</p><p>\"The housing market thus appears to remain locked between a ramp up in policy easing and the momentum of the downturn,\" Mr. Xing said.</p><p>Bingyan Wang in Beijing contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stella Yifan Xie at stella.xie@wsj.com and Cao Li at li.cao@wsj.com</p><p>China's Economic Woes Drag On With Factory Disruptions, Property Slump</p>",
