  "title": "Wednesday's Markets:  Inflation Comments  By Powell Help  S&P, Dow Advance  ----  By Caitlin McCabe and Joe Wallace",
  "text": "<p>   The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told members of Congress that inflation will moderate and that the central bank plans to maintain its current monetary policies. </p><p>   Both major indexes finished off their session highs after a choppy session marked by swings between gains and losses. U.S. stocks jumped to start the day -- launching the S&amp;P 500 to a new intraday high -- before trimming their gains and wobbling as the day continued. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 finished the day 5.09 points higher, or 0.1%, to end at 4374.30. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 44.44 points, or 0.1%, to 34933.23. </p><p>   The Nasdaq Composite fell 32.70 points, or 0.2%, to 14644.95, marking a two-day losing streak for the index. </p><p>   The fluctuations in major indexes came as investors continued to try to make sense of the outlook for inflation in the U.S., as well as how the Fed will respond. On Tuesday, the Labor Department said June's consumer-price index rose 5.4% from a year ago, the highest 12-month rate since August 2008. Meanwhile, the Labor Department said Wednesday that its producer-price index, which measures the prices that suppliers charge businesses and other customers, increased 7.3% in the 12 months ending in June on an unadjusted basis. That marked the largest jump since 12-month data were first calculated in November 2010. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Mr. Powell addressed the topic when presenting the Fed's semiannual monetary-policy report to the House Financial Services Committee He said in testimony that inflation \"has been higher than we've expected and a little bit more persistent\" than hoped. </p><p>   But he also noted that price increases should partially reverse as the effects of pandemic-related bottlenecks and supply constraints unwind. </p><p>   He added that the economy is still a ways off from reaching \"substantial further progress\" toward its employment and inflation goals. </p><p>   Major indexes are hovering just below their records. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is within striking distance of closing above 35000, a new milestone. Expectations of a strong economic rebound and healthy corporate results in this quarter's earnings season have helped power stocks. </p><p>   However, some investors are wary of potential hurdles for the broad market rally. In addition to concerns about inflation, investors are also keeping an eye on the spread of the delta variant of coronavirus, which on Wednesday prompted Australian officials to extend a lockdown of Sydney, while South Korea tightened curbs. </p><p>   High stock valuations are also a concern for some investors. </p><p>   \"We would not be surprised if you had a bit of a pullback,\" said Daniel Morris, chief market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. Longer term, however, Mr. Morris is bullish about the market. </p><p>   Shares of megacap technology companies helped lead the way. Netflix added $7.27, or 1.3%, to $547.95, while Apple gained $3.51, or 2.4%, to a record $149.15. Bloomberg News reported that Apple asked suppliers to build as many as 90 million next-generation iPhones this year, a sharp increase from last year. </p><p>   \"We're seeing a continuation of investors moving out of the reflation trade and money moving into secular growth areas of the market,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist for Truist Advisory Services. \"We're in this transitional period where there are a lot of questions. . . On an overall basis, the market is trading a bit more cautiously underneath the surface.\" </p><p>   Shares of banks and other financial-services companies were among the hardest hit -- of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors, only energy stocks fared worse -- even after many firms reported better-than-expected financial results. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.356% from 1.415% on Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. </p><p>   In the oil market, Brent-crude futures, the international benchmark, fell 2.3% to $74.76 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached a compromise with the United Arab Emirates over production, resolving a standoff that whipsawed energy markets this month. </p><p>   In overseas markets, the Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.1%. Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.9% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.3%. </p><p></p>",
