  "text": "<p>The past year has brought a glut of series charting the rise and Icarus-like fall of big-name entrepreneurs. So it's refreshing to come across a show that does the opposite by celebrating the small triumphs of everyday people.</p> <p>Returning to Apple TV Plus for a second season, the comedy-drama anthology <em>Little America</em> delivers eight more short stories based on the real lives of immigrants who realised their personal American dreams. In this often idiosyncratic, consistently warm-hearted multilingual collection there is an episode about a bravura bra saleswoman, one about a Somalian chef introducing “camel on a stick” to Minnesotans, and another which follows a young woman competing in a “car kissing” contest (exactly what it sounds like).</p> <p>While each tale is enriched by the specific details of the lead character's cultural background, there are themes and dynamics that recur throughout and speak to more universal experiences of migrant life. Much time is devoted, for instance, to the tensions that arise in intergenerational families — in particular the slightly paradoxical attitude of parents who made sacrifices to give their children American privileges only to disapprove when they then pursue their own interests. </p> <p>Not that the show suggests that “west is best”. Rather, it serves as a paean to multiculturalism as it explores how different minorities build communities with one another. In the first episode, a Korean family-run hat shop becomes the unofficial outfitter for a local gospel church; in the next, a Belizean woman finds spiritual solace among the Orthodox Jews of Brooklyn. </p> <p>This variety is fittingly matched by the different styles adopted by the changing roster of writers and directors. There are chapters that cover several decades, and others that follow life in a single day. Some are contemplative or sentimental while “Camel on a Stick” is as frantic as an episode of high-pressure kitchen drama <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cb55d07-9abf-4dee-a984-1761a95fbc1c\"><em>The Bear</em></a>. In every instance, the cast of relative unknowns demonstrate that <em>Little America</em> is full of big talent. </p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from December&#xa0;9</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Little America Season 2 review — idiosyncratic stories of immigrant life' FT.com 8 December.
