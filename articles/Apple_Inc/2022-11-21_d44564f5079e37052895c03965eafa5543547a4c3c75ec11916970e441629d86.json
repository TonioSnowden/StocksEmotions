  "title": "Will Ferrell on Working with Ryan Reynolds, Leaving 'SNL' and Making 'Barbie'; What intimidates the guy who always makes us laugh? In ​'​Spirited,​'​ Ferrell dances and sings alongside Ryan Reynolds in his most vulnerable role yet​.",
  "text": "<p>On this October morning, Ferrell is playing a parking attendant for reasons beyond comic value: Although his three sons are already at school (one in college), his home is a hive of domestic activity. Ferrell waves to his wife, Viveca Paulin-Ferrell, an art auctioneer and board member at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, as she sits idling in a blue Tesla, waiting to pull out. Paulin-Ferrell has to navigate a mobile pet grooming service van, a pair of contractor pickup trucks and people shuttling tools to a work site downhill from the main house. \"It's gonna be a tennis court,\" Ferrell explains. \"I don't play, but you need one if you want to sip a gin and tonic.\"</p><p>Leery of construction noise, Ferrell leads me past a chicken coop and inside the well-appointed guesthouse. By his own admission, the 55-year-old actor, comedian and producer is out of practice at interviews. \"I don't do this that much. Is that bad?\" he says as he slumps into an armchair. \"I used to have to. Now…I do it when I want to.\"</p><p>The statement sums up the former Saturday Night Live star's orientation toward acting. Ferrell spends much of his time overseeing his Big Money Players Network (whose podcasts include Clown Parade, on which Ferrell, Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers highlight young and underrepresented comedic talent) and Gloria Sanchez Productions (originally a part of Gary Sanchez Productions, Ferrell's company with Adam McKay), which he runs with Jessica Elbaum. Through Gloria Sanchez, Ferrell, whose comedies helped give rise to the so-called Frat Pack in the early 2000s, has produced films like Booksmart, Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar and Hustlers and helped champion female storytellers and stories focusing on women. \"It's all women, and then there's me,\" Ferrell says of the company. \"Everyone bends over backwards to check in with each other, and there's just an egoless kind of sharing of ideas. It's like, 'Oh, this is the way it should operate.' It's really healthy.\"</p><p>As a performer, however, Ferrell acknowledges he is deep in the \"zero f—s given\" phase of his career. He's made a movie send-up of telenovelas entirely in Spanish (Casa de mi Padre) and a straight-faced parody of a Lifetime movie—on Lifetime (A Deadly Adoption). He says nothing has left him feeling as exposed as Spirited (now streaming on Apple TV+), a musical reimagining of A Christmas Carol, in which he and Ryan Reynolds dance and sing songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Dear Evan Hansen and La La Land). Next year, Ferrell will star in Strays, voicing an abandoned dog in the \"incredibly filthy\" R-rated live-action animated film, and will play a toy company executive in Barbie, directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig. And he's about to film a yet-untitled wedding comedy with Reese Witherspoon from Bros writer-director Nicholas Stoller.</p><p>As we sit for a wide-ranging conversation, Ferrell is happy to shut his phone off. \"I only had my phone with me to make sure you weren't lost,\" Ferrell says, leaning in expectantly. \"Are you lost?\"</p><p>Alex Bhattacharji: So many of your lines are now part of the vernacular that people must quote back to you often. At this point, what is it like to hear someone say, \"When in Rome,\" \"You sit on a throne of lies\" or \"More cowbell\"?</p><p>Will Ferrell: Honest answer? It's all fantastic. It never stops being surreal, though, because everything in this business, at least for me, has been a delicious flying by the seat of my pants. Delicious corduroy wide-wale. So, when I think back to all the things that were silly notions, and they become part of the vernacular or a meme or a reference on SportsCenter—it just makes me laugh and go, \"That's so crazy.\" Because I think you have to remember, just for context, I grew up with a father as a musician [Lee Ferrell, sometime keyboardist for the Righteous Brothers] who'd lived very hand-to-mouth and saw the instability and was dead set against me becoming a performer. And then I got Saturday Night Live, which is my dream job, and I could've just hung it up. That was so much fun. All I ever wanted to do was ensemble comedy.</p><p>AB: Ultimately, what made you decide to leave SNL?</p><p>WF: I was creeping up on my seventh season, and it was just feeling like, for better or for worse, a good time to go. It was a mix of scary and \"No, this is the right time.\" I don't know why. Because there really wasn't a pile of scripts waiting for me. It was more like, \"I'm doing well from the show. I'm pretty well-known. Let's use this momentum to try.\" I had Old School. And then we had this script that was a great concept but needed some work about a grown man at the North Pole who thought he was an elf. So I packed up. \"I'm leaving the show. Let's see what happens.\"</p><p>You sit down with Lorne Michaels at your last show, and he says—which is one of my favorite Lorne comments, because it's an absolutely amazing compliment and at the same time there's still some instability to it—\"I have to say, I have to put you in the top three of anyone ever having done the show. Where in that top three—I can't tell you.\"</p><p>AB: Did that mess with you or motivate you?</p><p>WF: I was like, \"Thanks. Wow, that's great…. Oh, I guess. Am I third?\" Look, I have some talent. I knew there'd be people funnier than me, and I'd probably be funnier than other people. But I [also] knew no one would commit more than me. That's the one thing I could control.</p><p>AB: How does that manifest? What does it mean to work hard at comedy?</p><p>WF: It helps a lot that my brain, still to this day, is kicking out odd and amusing ideas, at least to me. The comedy game is really—if the audience thinks your ideas are funny, you'll have success. But if they don't, those ideas don't win. So that's the question: The sands in the hourglass, how much is there left? Do your ideas still intersect with the audience, or is it like, \"That's not what people think is funny anymore\"?</p><p>AB: How much do you think is left? Some of your movies have done poorly. The zeitgeist moves quickly, but it also moves in cycles, and the hourglass can flip over again.</p><p>WF: I try not to judge that too much. Just as long as I have some sort of currency in this business, I'm going to keep throwing things out there and see what sticks. I get motivated by, \"Oh, that feels like that'd be funny. Oh, let's pursue that,\" and then the hard work kicks in. But I'm not like, \"Must. Think. Of. Funny. Idea.\" It's not hard work in that regard.</p><p>AB: Who are your sounding boards for those ideas?</p><p>WF: I still have a bunch of writer friends. Also, I've been with the same agents [Jason Heyman, Martin Lesak and Jimmy Miller] this whole time, so we're all pretty close. Our company is a great forum, like, \"Hey, does this resonate with anyone?\" But at the same time, I never pitched the cowbell sketch. I just did it. If I pitched it, you'd be like, \"There's nothing there.\" Let me just write it and get out the beats. And then you'll be like, \"Oh, OK, I see it.\" So I'm also just my own advocate a lot of times.</p><p>AB: How do you choose what project to make?</p><p>WF: Well, there are different examples, like Eurovision Song Contest was an idea I literally had for almost 20 years. When I'd seen that show for the first time on one of our trips to Sweden [Paulin-Ferrell was born there], I thought, \"God, that's just so funny. That's a movie. There's no bandwidth over here, but someone's going to do it.\" And then as time took, I was like, \"It's so funny that no one's trying to do a Eurovision movie,\" and it started to get a little more traction. A lot of times, what governs me, in a way, is a mix of, \"Ooh, no one's done this\" or \"I haven't done this.\"</p><p>That's where we get into Spirited, when [director and co-writer] Sean Anders calls me four years ago. He's like, \"Hey, I've got an idea, a reimagining of A Christmas Carol, but this time it's from the ghost perspective, and it's a crisis of faith, and it's not the usual Scrooge is visited by the ghosts and wakes up the next day rejuvenated. It's these guys, led by Christmas Present, examining \"Is this [whole redemption thing] even working anymore?\" Then Sean was like, \"Oh, and it's a musical.\" And I go, \"Oh.\" Then within five minutes, I was like, \"Yeah—of course, it's a musical. Yeah, we have to do this.\"</p><p>AB: That's it. So first you and then Ryan Reynolds signed on the dotted line and became song-and-dance men?</p><p>WF: Yeah. Cut to us in seven weeks of rehearsals and a month just doing the pre-records. It was just crazy…. There was tons of anxiety, but that's where it was just great to be in the same foxhole together with Ryan and go, \"This is nuts, right?\" There were moments when Ryan and I were in a dance studio looking at each other in the mirrors trying to do the steps. Ryan's like, \"I feel like I'm in a Zumba class at The Villages retirement community in Florida.\" We're like, \"Wait, we're supposed to get to this twirl here and this thing. How is this going to happen? This is madness.\"</p><p>AB: What does it take to intimidate you? Was this the thing?</p><p>WF: Yep. You got it. That's the thing. This was sleepless nights, this was, \"Oh, next week is dedicated to the shooting of this one number,\" and waking up at 4 in the morning. And I can't go back to sleep, so I'm walking around in the dark through Boston Common with my earphones in, with the track, singing out loud, walking in the dark. People are waking up and going on their morning jogs and [thinking] \"What is that guy doing?\"</p><p>AB: You've always done musical bits in comedy—the singing Devil on SNL, \"Dust in the Wind\" in Old School and so on. But there's a difference between that and a proper musical.</p><p>WF: Huge difference. All of those other previous examples were comedic singing, like, \"Oh, that's funny,\" and maybe on occasion someone's like, \"You're kind of a good singer though, too, but that was really funny.\" This was legit. That was the intimidating part, to give an earnest performance with these songs. So, it was theater camp. It was full-on boot camp. It's literally the most vulnerable thing I've ever had to do. It just felt like that was the longest high-wire act done to date. Maybe the only closest thing was doing a movie entirely in Spanish, but that still was different. That still was not as intimidating, in a weird way.</p><p>AB: Have you ever considered what it is that makes you so funny?</p><p>WF: I'm terrible at self-analysis, but if I had to venture a guess: Obviously, I look like the guy next door, and I've been able to play against that in that you don't expect me to say or do the things that I've done in performances. But all I can say is that my brain is wired in a way that can somehow come up with weird stuff. It's that same loop of or the same process with \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" by Blue Öyster Cult. I always focus on the guy—I hear that cowbell in the background, I wonder what his life is like. These are the things that play through my head. That's the music.</p><p>AB: Ryan Reynolds has talked about how your ability to access vulnerability unlocks comedy. You've played so many funny and fragile man-children—Ron Burgundy, Ricky Bobby, Buddy the Elf, Frank the Tank, even Steve Butabi from A Night at The Roxbury. How did you become an avatar of the comedic man-child?</p><p>WF: I mean, it was never a conscious decision to develop that as a character or a genre or a type, but I think a lot of this stuff kept landing on the same square: that men, in so many ways, are just big babies and we can't take it—and we can't take that we know that about ourselves. I love pushing that out there because we should listen to that.</p><p>Not to get political, but we just had the biggest baby of all time running the country. It was the ultimate manifestation of this guy who'd act tough and mean, but then, \"I got the most glorious letter from Kim Jong Un.\" Just looking for validation at every turn. It was like this man-child, like, \"See, I'm doing things.\"</p><p>AB: The same year Talladega Nights came out, you also did the melancholy drama Stranger Than Fiction. Last year, you did a dramatic turn in the limited series The Shrink Next Door opposite Paul Rudd. To what extent do you want to be a dramatic actor?</p><p>WF: I mean, Shrink Next Door was like, \"Ooh, this is going to be challenging, this is going to be fun to work with Paul in a one-on-one thing.\" I love doing that kind of stuff. I guess the question is—and a lot of people go, \"You should do more drama\"—does it move the needle? I don't know.</p><p>AB: Do you worry that the audience won't accept you in a serious dramatic part?</p><p>WF: Well, that's a great question. I mean Matthew McConaughey, he just dominated that rom-com space and was that guy, and then is like, \"I don't want to do this anymore.\" I read how he made a concerted effort to get away from that. But, yeah, I don't have that vision for myself. I think at the end of the day, the audience wants me to just do comedy, in a way, which is fine. I'm open to listening to any idea, but the marketplace doesn't bring those serious things to me a lot of times. You can either say, \"I'm going to rail against that and show I can do this other thing,\" or is that just the cosmic karmic tax you have to pay for how great the other stuff has been? That's a small price to pay.</p><p>AB: You have three kids, ages 12, 15 and 18. Do they think you're funny?</p><p>WF: They're underwhelmed, but I can still get them to laugh every now and then—a little sneaker-upper and I catch them off guard. I'll be curious as they get older if they're like, \"Yeah, he was too serious.\" I don't know. I'd rather err on the side of, \"At least he was listening,\" as opposed to, \"My dad was funny, but never gave me the time of day.\"</p><p>AB: You and your now wife both worked at an art auction house in the 1990s, and you are now serious collectors. She has said you both enjoy Maurizio Cattelan and Ai Weiwei, who inject humor into their art. Is that where your tastes meet?</p><p>WF: Yeah, it's amazing. Ai Weiwei's middle finger series—to the White House and to famous monuments—that was really impactful. One of our boys—we got a call from the kindergarten teacher because he was giving the finger to something. We're like, \"Mattias, you can't do that.\" He goes, \"But what about Ai Weiwei? He does it.\" And we're like, \"Yeah, you're right. OK, you can do it now whenever you want.\"</p><p>AB: On the subject of high art and comedy, I wanted to ask you about Barbie and Greta Gerwig, who directed it. She co-wrote it with Noah Baumbach—both art-house icons.</p><p>WF: It is, in my humble opinion, the ultimate example of high art and low art. It's a loving homage to the brand and, at the same time, couldn't be more satirical—just an amazing comment on male patriarchy and women in society and why Barbie's criticized and yet why every little girl still wants to play with Barbie. Boy, when I read it, I was like, \"This is fantastic.\" I get to play the CEO of Mattel and be that guy who's just insensitive but weird and then, not to spoil anything, but…. Anyway, that's what excites me.</p><p>AB: Where else do you find joy?</p><p>WF: I love cleaning the chicken cage. No, really. I'm not doing a bit right now.</p><p>AB: It's tough to know with you. Is that meditative?</p><p>WF: I know. It is kind of meditative. I like going in and talking to them, giving them some scraps of food. I'll change their little—whatever, the wood shavings. Clean it all out, make sure their water's good. That's great. I really like it.</p><p>AB: I guess that brings me to a larger question: Where are you these days?</p><p>WF: Home. I'm here at home. I really love driving the kids to school and watching their sports. If the Mayor of Showbiz called me and said, \"We took a vote, you're out,\" I'd be like, \"Thank you so much. When do I get my gold watch?\"</p><p>AB: Will, thank you. Good stuff. Oh, I'm sorry. I just quoted you as Frank from Old School.</p><p>WF: But you know what, though? That was just the end of a take. There wasn't anything scripted there. I just went, \"Good stuff.\" Todd [Phillips] keeps it in, and then it becomes a thing that, how many years now, you're saying it back to me. I just randomly threw that out there, just messing around, not trying to be clever.</p><p>AB: Trying or not, it's now a way of acknowledging the awkward end of a heartfelt chat.</p><p>WF: Good stuff.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Will Ferrell on Working with Ryan Reynolds, Leaving 'SNL' and Making 'Barbie'</p>",
