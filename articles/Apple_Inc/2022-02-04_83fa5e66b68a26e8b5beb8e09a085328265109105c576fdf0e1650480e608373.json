  "text": "<p>Meta said it expected revenue growth to slow because users were spending less time on its more lucrative services.</p><p>It cited inflation as a weight on advertiser spending and estimated that ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple Inc. last year would cost Meta some $10 billion this year.</p><p>For years, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has enjoyed its status as one of the largest companies in the U.S. stock market. The plunge in its market value served as a reminder of its influence and dominance. Its drop exceeded the individual market capitalizations of 472 companies in the S&amp;P 500, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Its drop in market value also surpassed the record that Apple Inc. set in September 2020. The iPhone maker lost about $182 billion on Sept. 3 of that year, according to Dow Jones Market Data, during a selloff of technology stocks.</p><p>The 26% tumble in its stock price weighed heavily on major U.S. indexes and rippled across the market. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.4%, its biggest percentage decline since February 2021. In contrast, the equally weighted S&amp;P 500 index -- which gives the same weight to both the smallest and largest companies in the index -- lost 1.4%</p><p>With Thursday's close, Meta has a market value of about $647.17 billion, making it the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P 500. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with a market value of about $703.8 billion, replaced Meta as the sixth-largest Thursday.</p>",
