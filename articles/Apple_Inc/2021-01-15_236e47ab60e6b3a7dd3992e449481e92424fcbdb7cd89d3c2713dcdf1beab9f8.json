  "text": "<p>TSMC just logged another bumper quarter: Net profit for the three months ended in December rose 23% from a year earlier. That brought full-year profit to a record $17.6 billion, a 50% increase from 2019.</p><p>Strong demand helped TSMC, which makes chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia. Stay-at-home demand led to a boom in personal computers and servers used in data centers. Also, 5G smartphones and base stations added to chip demand.</p><p>TSMC sailed smoothly through the Trump administration's ban on Huawei, previously an important customer. China accounted for only 6% of TSMC's revenue last quarter, compared with 22% a year earlier. Orders from Apple and Taiwanese chip company MediaTek, which supplies many Chinese phone makers, probably helped to offset the blow.</p><p>The sudden jump in demand led to tight supply for chips throughout the year. Shortages forced some car makers to delay production. TSMC's revenue from the automotive sector grew 27% last quarter, though the segment accounted for only 3% of its revenue. The supply constraints helped TSMC: The company managed to expand its net profit margin last quarter by 2.9 percentage points compared with a year earlier.</p><p>The chip shortage means a record year of investment ahead for TSMC as well. It expects $25 billion to $28 billion in capital spending this year, a 45% to 62% increase from 2020. Semiconductor-equipment makers like ASML Holding will benefit.</p><p>Those investments mean TSMC is confident about its future. One potential new customer could be Intel, which is considering outsourcing some of its production in the most-chip-advanced nodes. Bernstein estimates capturing 20% of Intel's production needs could boost TSMC's revenue 8%. But even if Intel decides against outsourcing, TSMC could benefit from AMD's rising market share, says Bernstein. AMD, a TSMC customer, has been eroding Intel's market share in CPUs.</p><p>TSMC's shares are trading at 29 times forward earnings, after gaining 79% since the beginning of 2020. That might seem pricey, but the company is spending a lot of cash to maintain its technological edge -- add in growing demand and the struggles of competitors, and that premium valuation looks a bit less hard to swallow.</p>",
