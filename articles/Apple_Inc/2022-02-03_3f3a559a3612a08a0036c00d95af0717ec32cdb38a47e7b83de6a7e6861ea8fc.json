  "text": "<p>The airline said Thursday it will resume in-flight alcohol sales — including beer, wine and liquor — Feb. 16 on flights of 176 miles or more.</p><p>The selection of non-alcoholic beverages on those flights is expanding as well, including tonic water, apple juice, hot tea and hot cocoa.</p><p>“Customers have expressed a desire for more beverage options, so we're delighted to restore additional on-board offerings,” Tony Roach, Southwest's vice president for customer experience and customer relations, said in a statement.</p><p>Southwest LUV and other airlines suspended in-flight alcohol sales in March 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Last May, Southwest and American Airlines AALextended the pause on alcohol sales after a rise in unruly behavior by passengers, including an incident where a Southwest flight attendant had two teeth broken when she was assaulted by a passenger.</p><p>Passengers on U.S. airlines are still required to wear masks on flights, but may remove them when eating or drinking.</p>",
