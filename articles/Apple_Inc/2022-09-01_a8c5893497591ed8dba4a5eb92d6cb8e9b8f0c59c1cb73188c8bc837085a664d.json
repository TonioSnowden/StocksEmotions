  "text": "<p>Brad Pitt doesn't need to borrow another movie star's entrance, yet here he struts, shoes-first, into the breakneck caper \"Bullet Train,\" grooving to a Japanese cover of \"Staying Alive\" as though he fancies himself the Tony Manero of Tokyo, another likable bum looking to better himself a smidge. This cheeky theft of \"Saturday Night Fever\" is the director David Leitch's so-sue-me admission that he's a cultural magpie. Working off Kôtarô Isaka's 2010 thriller novel, Mr. Leitch poaches bits of other genre action flicks—katana slice-em-ups, gun-packing British comedies, sunbaked cartel melodramas—and welds them together for a careening contraption that attempts to vault over every gap in its tracks.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Undeclared War (Peacock)</p><p>Predicting the future has its hazards. In \"The Undeclared War,\" set in late spring 2024, Boris Johnson has been gone from 10 Downing Street for only a few months; Vladimir Putin, undistracted by Ukraine, has all the time in the world to create havoc on the internet. But we get it: This gripping, troubling, we-hope-it-isn't-prescient espionage series isn't really about tomorrow.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Patient (FX on Hulu)</p><p>If \"The Patient\" were a book, what shelf would it go on? Thrillers? Psychology? Holocaust Studies? Judaica? An option would be Self-Help: Sam Fortner (Domhnall Gleeson) is a serial killer who wants to stop murdering people—though in his efforts to improve, he becomes a kidnapper as well.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Leonardo (The CW)</p><p>Defying trends in air travel, friends have just returned from a trip to Paris, during which they posted photos of the Mona Lisa, as one does. Getting a decent shot took some effort: The hordes that jam the Louvre to see the Italian Renaissance masterpiece have always seemed less possessed by a love of art or history and something closer to religious fervor. If Mona L herself were in the room, they'd be jockeying to touch the hem of her garment.</p><p>With that in mind, \"Leonardo\" might be construed as heretical, given how fast and loose the CW series plays with the life of Leonardo da Vinci, author of the aforementioned painting, bona-fide genius and one of the architects of Western civilization. At the risk of delivering a backhanded compliment, though, it's not as much of an affront as one might fear. It's audacious, yes, and certainly takes liberties with history—Leonardo was never accused of the murder upon which the season's narrative revolves; his \"victim\" never existed. But at the same time, the show takes seriously the devotion to art, engineering, anatomy, armaments and technology that he must have had, given what he accomplished over 67 years (1452-1519).</p><p>Read the review</p><p>House of the Dragon (HBO)</p><p>It's hard to imagine the uninitiated viewer getting past the introduction to the \"Game of Thrones\" prequel \"House of the Dragon\" without thinking, \"Wake up and smell the Kool-Aid.\" The ponderous recitation of textual obscurities; the litany of unintelligible names; the holy tone—is this a TV show or a religious exercise? Some may suspect, with good reason, that the modus operandi of the entertainment industry now is to create experiences that not only amuse but indoctrinate. (See: The Marvel Cinematic Universe.)</p><p>Sign me up...</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Welcome to Wrexham (FX)</p><p>\"There is a version of this story,\" actor Rob McElhenney tells actor Ryan Reynolds during their \"Welcome to Wrexham\" docuseries, \"where we're the villains.\" It's not just a candid thing to say, it's strategic: Two Hollywood A-listers buying a stalled-out Welsh soccer team? They might be perceived as dabblers, tourists, only in it for the TV show. They might have to sell, eventually. They might even leave the team worse off than it was, and a temporarily buoyant community bereft. \"Football isn't a matter of life or death,\" says one Wrexhamite (paraphrasing the late Liverpudlian Bill Shankly). \"It's more important than that.\"</p><p>Read the review</p><p>They/Them (Peacock)</p><p>The pronoun debate is a singular social issue, one that a plurality of the population seems to find slightly horrifying. Enter \"They/Them,\" an aptly ambiguous entry into the genre-movie pool—a good-natured slasher flick set at an LGBTQIA+ conversion camp. It includes a wonderful serving of Kevin Bacon and at least one outburst of \"Glee.\" If you're a bit confused already, mission accomplished.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>A League of Their Own (Prime Video)</p><p>To paraphrase that '80s Oldsmobile commercial, this is not your mother's \"A League of Their Own.\" Or maybe it is? Based on the 1992 Penny Marshall film starring Geena Davis and Tom Hanks, the eight-part Amazon adaptation charges directly into the issues that the 30-year-old movie side-stepped—racism and lesbianism, specifically—and is one of the more engaging series of the year thus far.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Rogue Agent (AMC+)</p><p>All the teasers and come-ons for the feature-length \"Rogue Agent\" are about its fact-based con artistry, which is kind of a shame: Directors Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson play things so straight for so long that if an audience didn't know anything at all, it might be as surprised by the scammery to come as is the heroine of the movie.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Innocents (Shudder)</p><p>Children with power are scary. Rod Serling, Stephen King and \"The Bad Seed\" have all shown that to be true, as did Henry James in \"The Turn of the Screw\"—and director Jack Clayton, who turned the James novella into \"The Innocents\" of 1961. In that tale lay ambiguity. In \"The Innocents\" of Eskil Vogt, good and evil simply square off, just below the sightline of adults.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Thirteen Lives</p><p>On June 23, 2018, 12 boys and a coach from a soccer team in northern Thailand entered the Tham Luang cave network to have some fun exploring after practice, as they had done on occasion before. While they were inside, unforeseen heavy rains flash-flooded the caves, leaving them stranded more than two miles from the entrance. It took 10 agonizing days before any diver could get through the forbidding terrain to reach them and determine they were all still alive. But there appeared to be no way to get them out.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Murder at the Cottage (Topic)</p><p>It's certainly not fair, but the \"who\" and \"where\" of a murder case can dictate the uproar around it; the absence of an evident \"why\" means even more attention will be paid. It isn't usually personal. It's just business.</p><p>As regards \"Murder at the Cottage,\" the personal is unavoidable. While the five-part series is not about Irish director Jim Sheridan himself—it's not a \"personal documentary\" as commonly understood—it's certainly the most intimate kind of pursuit, given the subject at hand. In exploring the death of the French filmmaker Sophie Toscan du Plantier, who was slain near her vacation home in West Cork, Ireland, in 1996, Mr. Sheridan displays not just a thirst for abstract truth, and a journalistic doggedness. He expresses a profound regret that someone who was a guest in his country should have been so brutally slain and her case—and her corpse—treated so shabbily. Also, like the detective in the classic noir \"Laura,\" he might be slightly in love with the victim, whom he knows only through her picture.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Five Days at Memorial (Apple TV+)</p><p>\"Five Days at Memorial,\" an eight-part, blow-by-blow re-creation of what happened at the title hospital during and after Hurricane Katrina, may eventually be recognized as a classic of the disaster genre. But it may take another 17 years for the 2005 storm—and the memories—to recede before the series can be appreciated as entertainment. When it comes to on-screen catastrophes, part of the thrill is wondering what we might do under the same set of circumstances. Unlike \"The Towering Inferno,\" say, or \"Station Eleven,\" this story is nonfiction. And \"thrill\" isn't quite the word.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Spin Me Round</p><p>A movie that starts out mocking an Olive Garden-style chain restaurant in Bakersfield, Calif., might be expected to indulge in easy laughs, but there's nothing rote or predictable about \"Spin Me Round,\" a difficult-to-classify comedy about a bright, eager restaurant manager who along with several other high-achieving employees from the chain is rewarded with all-expenses-paid corporate trip to Tuscany. The movie starts out as a cringe comedy but seems as if it could turn into either an Agatha Christie mystery or a lurid horror picture. The critical question on the audience's mind for most of the running time will be not so much \"Whodunit?\" as \"What type of movie are we watching?\"</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Afghanistan Undercover (PBS)</p><p>Since the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan last summer, women there have experienced domestic violence on a national scale—so says \"Afghanistan Undercover,\" a \"Frontline\" presentation timed to the anniversary of the Taliban takeover last Aug. 15. Despite vague pre-takeover assurances from the country's fundamentalist Muslim leadership, what correspondent Ramita Navai finds are widespread cases of torture, beatings, capricious imprisonment, forced marriage and a nonexistent system of criminal justice through which any woman might seek redress. Ms. Navai's reporting, much of it done in secret, calls into question not just the legitimacy but competence of the current Afghan regime.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Sprung (Freevee)</p><p>Greg Garcia, the creator, writer and director of \"Sprung,\" wrote a note to the press regarding his new comedy: If you like it, he said, tell everyone. If you don't, keep it to yourself. \"Go get an ice cream or something. It's on me. I'll Venmo you.\"</p><p>As much as I like Jamoca Almond Fudge, I like \"Sprung\" more: It may feature some spectacularly dopey people but it's a smart comedy, one that proves two things: There are, in fact, new places to take the half-hour-or-so sitcom format. And there is such a thing as a free lunch.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>The Good Boss</p><p>A scale proves to be an apt and rich metaphor for how to keep a company going in the slyly engaging workplace comedy \"The Good Boss,\" which was the big winner at the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars last winter.</p><p>Taking place at a factory that makes scales, the film adopts balance as its theme and watchword. Such respect for subtlety tends to go begging at the Academy Awards, but it earned a record 20 nominations at Spain's Goya Awards and won six prizes including Best Picture, Best Actor for Javier Bardem and Best Director and Screenplay for writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Breaking</p><p>\"I'm worth nothing. I am nothing,\" says John Boyega in a deeply moving performance as former Marine Brian Brown-Easley, in \"Breaking,\" an intense drama about an episode that took place in 2017. Brown-Easley, a desperate man with no fixed address, is seen taking two hostages inside a suburban Atlanta bank. In the strange futility of his actions he becomes an uneasy symbol of all the troubled young black American men who have had distressing police encounters rooted in trivial disputes.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>Pantheon (AMC+)</p><p>Is there life after death? Is there parenting after death? In 1989's \"New York Stories,\" Woody Allen put Sheldon's late mom up in the sky (the segment \"Oedipus Wrecks\"). In \"Pantheon,\" dad is on the internet.</p><p>The animated series is not a comedy, but it does have a sense of humor, dark though it may be: When high-schooler Maddie (voice of Katie Chang) suffers bullying-by-text, the mean girls' phones are suddenly all hacked, they receive insulting messages that seem to be from each other, and they melt down into satisfying heaps of misery. She doesn't know what's up, but the viewer does: Katie's terminally ill father has died—physically—but his brain is making mischief on the web.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>I Came By (Netflix)</p><p>Casting Hugh Bonneville as a psychopathic murderer is just one of the stratagems that elevate \"I Came By\" above the standard serial-killer thriller, not that it doesn't adhere to a considerable amount of formula. But having lorded over Downton Abbey since before World War I and been a good friend to Paddington the bear, Mr. Bonneville presents the least likely kind of upper-crust gent to be making young men disappear in chi-chi London. That his character uses a ceramist's kiln for evidence disposal does, somehow, seem like a concession to branding.</p><p>Read the review</p><p>What to Watch: The 20 Best New Movies and TV Shows From August</p>",
