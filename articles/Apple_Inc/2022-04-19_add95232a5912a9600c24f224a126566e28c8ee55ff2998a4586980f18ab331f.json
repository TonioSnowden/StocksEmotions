  "text": "<p>Disrupter of disrupters? Or swan song of the special purpose acquisition company? European investors are making that call over a deal involving music streaming service Deezer. The French group has reached terms with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51f4a558-8044-4e49-86f5-734589280518\">cash shell I2PO</a> to list on Euronext Paris at a pre-money value of €1bn. </p> <p>Bringing together billionaires François-Henri Pinault and Leonard Blavatnik, the new business aims to grab a growing share of the streaming market. That means taking on Big Tech and Spotify, which controls around a third of the market. </p> <p>The deal permits a fascinating comparative study of a fevered Spac float versus the chilled, low-cost direct listing chosen by Spotify in 2018.</p> <p>Deezer thinks it can distribute via third-party content providers in underexploited regions. That contrasts with the direct-to-consumer model pursued by Spotify, Apple and Amazon. </p> <p>Record labels hoping to weaken the status quo may hum along to this tune. Deezer chief executive Jeronimo Folgueira highlights a distribution deal with German television channel RTL, which has its own streaming services.</p> <p>Less positively, some Deezer distributors with physical stores were forced to close during the pandemic. Sales grew only 5.5 per cent last year to €400mn. In contrast, Spotify raised revenues by over a fifth to €9.7bn. The US-listed business should make its first profit this year. </p> <p>Deezer sales growth moved into double digits in February. A target of €1bn in sales by 2025 requires further rapid acceleration. Blavatnik's cross ownership of Warner Music should make that ambitious plan easier for Deezer to achieve.</p> <p>If so, shares are cheap at a multiple of about one times 2025 sales or a discount of a quarter to Spotify's valuation. The equation looks pricey on shorter-term forecasts. </p> <p>In a Spac, shareholders are not all created equal. Investors joining via a private placing are getting their shares at a 44 per cent discount to those in the original, listed cash shell. Founders enjoy a 90 per cent discount. That imbalance may raise as many questions for investors from communitarian Europe as Deezer's brave plan to disrupt the streaming oligopoly.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8e3cc05d-fc32-4f96-b4ab-82120c177542.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source:  2022 'Deezer: Pinault and Blavatnik wield Spac to whack Spotify' FT.com 19 April.
