This excellent electric vehicle has won the&#xa0;KBB Electric Car Best Buy award&#xa0;in 2019, 2020, and 2021. In other words, for as long as the Kona Electric has existed.</p><p>The big question is: How far can the 2022 Hyundai Kona Electric travel on a single charge? According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the range is 258 miles. This compares fairly well with the least expensive Tesla Model 3 TSLA, which can cover 263 miles. And especially with the Chevrolet Bolt EV that's able to run for 259 miles.</p><p>HyundaiAn unbeatable 10-year/100,000-mile warranty covers both the battery and powertrain in the 2022 Kona Electric. In crash tests, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the regular Kona its maximum score of five stars. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety made it a Top Safety Pick.</p><p>Those are some of the tangible reasons that make the Hyundai Kona Electric a great vehicle, not just great for an EV. In addition, like&#xa0;every Hyundai Kona, the driving experience is enjoyable, the parking experience is easily tolerable, equipment levels are generous, and the interior is pleasant.</p><p>The rest of the 2022 Hyundai Kona range, with combustion engines, is&#xa0;reviewed separately.</p><p>2022 Hyundai Kona Electric pricing</p><p>Before getting into the figures, where can you buy a 2022 Kona Electric? At the moment, it's available in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Hyundai plans to make the Kona Electric available in neighboring states, depending on production and demand.</p><p>Pricing for the 2022 Hyundai Kona EV starts at $34,000 for SEL trim, which is more than $3,000 less than the 2021 model. The Limited trim (now the top of the range) comes in at $42,500. A $7,500 federal tax credit and other state incentives for electric vehicles can offset these initial costs.</p><p>The most affordable Tesla, the Model 3, starts at approximately $45K, and is now ineligible for the federal tax credit. The&#xa0;Chevrolet Bolt EV&#xa0;begins at about $31K.</p><p>Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Kona Electric. The&#xa0;Tesla Model 3&#xa0;will probably have the strongest resale values, but the Kona Electric shouldn't be far behind.</p><p>Read:Not ready for an electric vehicle, despite the spike in gas prices? Buckle up, here are some of the most fuel-efficient traditional cars</p><p>Driving the 2022 Hyundai Kona Electric</p><p>Officially, the range is 258 miles. But during our long-term testing with a Hyundai Kona Electric, we managed to tease out 275 miles by driving conservatively and making the most of the regenerative braking system.</p><p>At the performance end of an electric drivetrain's attributes, the 291 lb-ft of torque in the Kona Electric enables quick launches from standstill as well as some mid-range punch for overtaking. Just because there are no emissions doesn't mean there's no fun.</p><p>Among the changes for the 2022 Kona Electric is a recalibration of the suspension that&#xa0;Hyundai&#xa0;says improves both ride quality and handling. The company has also installed new acoustic windshield glass and extra sound insulation to reduce noise, harshness, and vibration levels.</p><p>HyundaiInterior comfort</p><p>Hyundai has managed to wrangle another half an inch of rear legroom, bringing it to 35.2 inches. That's not as good as the Honda HR-V, but this is the smallest class of crossover. And the Kona Electric is better suited to city and suburb duty rather than road trips with the whole family on board.</p><p>A new 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen joins an equally fresh 10.25-inch digital driver information display in the Limited trim. This model also gains ambient cabin lighting. In both trims, the center console has been redesigned for 2022, with a lower section dedicated for wireless device charging.</p><p>How much cargo space does the 2022 Hyundai Kona Electric have? There's 19.2 cubic feet behind the rear seats. When they're folded down, the maximum area is 45.8 cubic feet.</p><p>Also see: EV charging network plans luxury stations</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>Although it's perfectly logical to put the charge port on the front of the car, so connecting the cable is easier when the 2022 Kona Electric is parked nose-in, the flap is quite visible and looks a little awkward. Otherwise, this subcompact crossover looks pretty sharp.</p><p>The changes for 2022 include smaller LED headlights and thinner, stretched-out taillights. Last year's dimpled nose gives way to a smoother look. New alloy wheel designs become available, and SEL trim offers the option of a 2-tone black roof.</p><p>You might like: Thinking about an electric car?

Some are pledging to go fully electric within a few years. It really looks like electric vehicles are the future, at least the near future. And it feels good to be in the vanguard of sustainable driving.</p><p>Blue Link connected car systemThis feature links the Kona Electric to the wider world through the owner's smartphone. Among the services it delivers are remote cabin pre-heating or cooling, remote locking, roadside assistance, stolen vehicle location, checking on battery levels, and setting the charging schedule.</p><p>Learn more:What is EV, BEV, HEV, PHEV?

Like a powered sunroof, heated front seats, automatic climate control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, under-floor storage tray, and wireless charging. These are all standard in the more luxurious Limited version.</p><p>This higher trim&#xa0;also provides leather seating surfaces, 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat, 10.25-inch digital driver information display, self-dimming rearview mirror, garage door opener, ambient cabin lighting, rain-sensing/aerodynamic wipers, 18-inch alloy wheels, and LED headlights.</p><p>The infotainment system gains a new 10.25-inch touchscreen, navigation, rear USB port, and an 8-speaker Harman Kardon audio upgrade. Driver assistance features are bolstered by adaptive cruise control with stop/go, automatic high beams, and rear parking sensors.</p><p>Check out:Which electric SUVs have the most cargo space?
