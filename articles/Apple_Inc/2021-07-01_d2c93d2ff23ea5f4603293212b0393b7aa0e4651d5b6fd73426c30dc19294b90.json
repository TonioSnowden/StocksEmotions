For me, however, I'm far happier to take my lead from the poet John Betjeman, who finds in Camberley “The drawing room is done in pink / The other rooms are mauve, I think” and “Pear and apple in Croydon gardens bud and blossom and fall”.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Gibbs</strong><br><em>Villars, France</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Betjeman and Mitford and suburban floral snobbery' FT.com 1 July.
