  "title": "Senate Confirms Jonathan Kanter as Justice Department Antitrust Chief; Nominee, receiving bipartisan support, joins a department that already has been active in filing lawsuits",
  "text": "<p>President Biden nominated Mr. Kanter in July to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division, a choice welcomed by progressives who want the government to challenge more corporate mergers and business conduct that could stifle competition.</p><p>Mr. Kanter has seen two decades of antitrust battles from several vantage points. His early career was at the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department. He then spent about 20 years in private practice representing a range of corporate clients.</p><p>Over time his focus shifted from defending companies facing government investigations to representing clients who urged the government to take action against industry giants, especially top tech companies. Both he and Lina Khan, Mr. Biden's choice to lead the FTC, have argued that the antitrust agencies need to do more to prevent companies from acquiring too much power in the marketplace.</p><p>Mr. Kanter has represented Microsoft Corp. and others in battles with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which is now facing antitrust claims from the Justice Department and state attorneys general. (News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal's owner, Dow Jones &amp; Co., also has been a client of Mr. Kanter.)</p><p>The Justice Department hasn't had a Senate-confirmed antitrust chief since Makan Delrahim left at the end of the Trump administration. Nevertheless, the antitrust division, run by career officials and overseen by Attorney General Merrick Garland and other high-level appointees, has filed a series of aggressive cases this year.</p><p>The Justice Department earlier this year blocked a more than $30 billion insurance industry merger. The department is currently challenging a partnership between American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. as well as a deal that would combine two top publishers: Penguin Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster.</p><p>Mr. Kanter is arriving as other lengthy investigations are nearing decision points, including probes of Google's ad-tech business and Apple Inc.'s business practices.</p><p>The department also is considering whether to challenge other mergers, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.</p><p>Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com</p><p>Senate Confirms Jonathan Kanter as Justice Department Antitrust Chief</p>",
