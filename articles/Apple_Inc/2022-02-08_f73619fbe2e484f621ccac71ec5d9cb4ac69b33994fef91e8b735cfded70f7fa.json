  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>SoftBank's $66bn sale of UK-based chip business Arm to Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59c0d5f9-ed6a-4de6-a997-f25faed58833\">collapsed on Monday</a> after regulators in the US, UK and EU raised serious concerns about its effects on competition in the global semiconductor industry, according to three people with direct knowledge of the transaction.</p> <h2>Jones Day's dancing days could be numbered</h2> <p>Spend enough weekends at the local honky-tonk and mastering the Texas two-step becomes simple enough.</p> <p>Thanks to law firms like <strong>Jones Day</strong>, however, the manoeuvre has become synonymous with something more complicated and less wholesome.</p> <p>Jones Day claimed almost $60mn in court-approved bankruptcy fees for advising companies on a complex corporate restructuring process that can shelter them from paying out large personal injury awards, as outlined in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de1da1ea-d19a-4f2d-a790-8ff45368d7d1\">this FT deep-dive</a>. The true financial rewards are likely to be far higher, as the court-approved fees are a fraction of the total.</p> <p>Here's where the fancy footwork comes in. A company facing litigation can use a Texas state statute to split itself into two separate entities — the so-called GoodCo and BadCo.</p> <p>It ringfences legal liabilities into BadCo. BadCo then files for insolvency, and GoodCo is left to carry on unperturbed.</p> <p>The two-step gambit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de13b1ec-9b4a-4a27-ae63-c8ea38ffc683\">is made possible</a> by the Lone Star state's divisional merger law, which — unlike every other US state excluding Delaware — defines a merger to include “the division of a domestic entity into two or more new domestic entities or other organisations”.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8330440.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The controversial strategy re-entered the spotlight when Jones Day was enlisted by <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> to engineer a Texas two-step last autumn, as the number of lawsuits alleging the pharma group's baby talcum powder was sometimes tainted with carcinogenic asbestos neared 40,000.</p> <p>The firm helped J&amp;J <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/inside-jjs-secret-plan-cap-litigation-payouts-cancer-victims-2022-02-04/\">create a limited liability company</a> in Texas, forming the subsidiary that would take on the baby talc claims. Some Jones Day partners have claimed billing rates of up to $1,450 per hour on the restructuring. And from last month, senior partners can bill as much as $1,850 per hour, court documents show.</p> <p>The new subsidiary, <strong>LTL Management</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c82423d4-6728-4292-9653-44b87ebd7a94\">filed for bankruptcy</a> in October and established a $2bn trust to pay out talc claims in what critics allege is an attempt to force victims into accepting significantly lower settlements. J&amp;J has denied its talc contains asbestos and can cause cancer.</p> <p>This isn't Jones Day's first rodeo. The firm has successfully marketed the Texas two-step to <strong>Koch Industries</strong>' manufacturer <strong>Georgia-Pacific</strong> (which battled its own asbestos claims <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgiapacific-asbestos-bankruptcy-idUSKBN1D21LP\">in 2017</a>) as well as the US unit of France-based <strong>Saint-Gobain</strong>, and <strong>Trane Technologies</strong>.</p> <p>The Cleveland firm's fee bonanza could be in jeopardy, however, as courts and the <strong>Department of Justice </strong>increase scrutiny of the process that critics argue makes the US insolvency system an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41c8bfa9-a60b-43a2-917d-323b3ee5e19d\">easy target for abuse</a>.</p> <p>Congressional lawmakers have drafted legislation in an effort to stop the practice. Bankruptcy judges are being more circumspect in these cases. And some asbestos claimants are suing to block J&amp;J's bankruptcy applications.</p> <p>For now though, the music is still playing — and some lawyers are certainly dancing.</p> <h2>Private equity: Hollywood's new power brokers?</h2> <p>Hollywood is a place with good weather and better parties, where billionaires come to spend money on vanity projects.</p> <p>The new entrants in Tinseltown are private equity headliners <strong>Blackstone </strong>and <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, both known for their lean financial management and ability to avoid losses. </p> <p>They're auditioning to become Hollywood's next power brokers after backing film production companies acting as content “arms dealers” for streaming services including <strong>Netflix</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Hulu </strong>in a battle for eyeballs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ab84caf-fc4e-4e78-b117-19df8ebb2fc4\">report</a> DD's Antoine Gara and the FT's Anna Nicolaou.</p> <p>Over the past two years, Blackstone has invested more than $2bn into <strong>Candle Media</strong>, a roll-up of recently created production companies. Last month, Apollo injected $760mn into production house <strong>Legendary Pictures</strong>, the studio behind <em>Dune</em> and <em>Interstellar</em>.</p> <p>The entertainment industry has become a safer bet for buyout firms, as studios churn out high volumes of content on the cheap — a far cry from the boom-and-bust proposition of old Hollywood.</p> <p>Blackstone and Apollo's bets are also characteristic of their current investment styles.</p> <p>Blackstone, under the direction of its global head of private equity <strong>Joe Baratta</strong>, has used its relationships in Hollywood to buy and build production companies almost from the ground up. Its foray is led by entertainment industry insiders <strong>Kevin Mayer </strong>and <strong>Tom Staggs</strong>.</p> <p>Candle acquired <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong>'s production company <strong>Hello Sunshine</strong> for $900mn in August and has struck deals with kids' media group <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/blackstone-backed-firm-nears-3-billion-deal-moonbug-entertainment-sources-2021-11-03/\"><strong>Moonbug Entertainment</strong></a> and <strong>Will Smith</strong>'s production company <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/westbrook-inc-announces-strategic-minority-investment-from-candle-media-next-generation-media-company-backed-by-kevin-mayer-tom-staggs-and-blackstone/\"><strong>Westbrook</strong></a>. The studio will continue to make acquisitions before an eventual IPO or sale, according to sources.</p> <p>Blackstone believes streaming-focused companies have cost advantages over legacy production companies such as <strong>Lionsgate</strong>. Its programmes like Moonbug's kids series <em>Cocomelon</em> are produced with little cash costs and generate staggering returns on equity. Supplying Netflix also requires a minimal cash outlay since it fronts the cost of an entire season.</p> <p>“These businesses are all capital-light and cash generative,” said Baratta. “It's like the greatest M&amp;A advisory business.”</p> <p>Apollo instead opts to buy cheaply and in bulk. It made its investment in Legendary on a preferred basis, giving it seniority to equity holder <strong>Dalian Wanda</strong>, a foundering Chinese conglomerate that overpaid for the outfit, spending $3.5bn in 2016.</p> <p>“This transaction is a very Apollo-esque way of playing this trend. There is tremendous value in the [Legendary] library, and we have a lot of downside protection in the investment”, said <strong>David Sambur</strong>, co-head of private equity at Apollo. </p> <p>If the screenwriters of private equity-backed production companies run out of material, they may do well to look at their backers for plot lines.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da3ae062-1b7c-41f5-ab78-07a7c6989379\">bitter fallout</a> between billionaire Apollo co-founders <strong>Leon Black </strong>and <strong>Josh Harris</strong>, currently playing in a New York court, would surely get soaked up by Netflix viewers. </p> <h2>Oaktree captures Evergrande's Castle</h2> <p>We imagine that no two days are alike for a distressed debt fund manager at <strong>Oaktree Capital Management</strong>.</p> <p>This, after all, is the same firm that cemented its reputation for a take-no-prisoners approach during an epic clash with private equity powerhouse <strong>Apollo </strong>over the bankruptcy of casino group <strong>Caesars</strong>. It was a gruelling skirmish that saw Oaktree's founder <strong>Howard Marks</strong> fall out with longtime friend and Apollo founder Leon Black (DD's Sujeet Indap <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caesars-Palace-Coup-Billionaire-Corruption/dp/163576677X\">wrote a book </a>about this billionaires brawl).</p> <p>Even by those standards, however, the moment last week when Oaktree dramatically gatecrashed China's largest-ever restructuring probably wasn't just another day in the office.</p> <p>The Los Angeles-based firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d82c807-ca1f-4101-b515-e0f53f9503ed\">stripped</a> real estate group <strong>Evergrande </strong>of its ownership of a vast plot of land in Hong Kong — codenamed “Project Castle” because the Chinese property developer's chair had for a decade planned to build his own Palace of Versailles-style mansion on the site.</p> <p>And yet, Marks drily described the headline-making incident as just a “routine transaction” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93102a3e-943b-4828-aa9d-f85e939055fe\">in an interview with the FT</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I don't think it's audacious,” he said. “To induce us to make the loan, the company provided us security. And with lots of collaboration and discussion, we are exercising our rights to that security.”</p> <p>While DD doesn't doubt Marks' savvy, our one main takeaway is this: while taking on Black is one thing,<strong> Xi Jinping</strong> may be quite another.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Billionaire tech investor <strong>Peter Thiel</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82774b98-965d-4ed8-9876-cd250ed1448c\">will not seek re-election</a> to the board of <strong>Facebook</strong>'s owner <strong>Meta</strong> later this year.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Gerhard Schröder</strong>, the former German chancellor, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/f6814055-26ac-4a48-8dff-c295a1a1bafd\">has been nominated</a> to join the board of Russian energy group <strong>Gazprom</strong>, fuelling scrutiny of his close links to the Kremlin-controlled company.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6dcd72f-f11a-4223-8a1b-aad6a9bad983\">has appointed</a> its operations director and current board member <strong>Jennie Daly </strong>as its next chief executive, thwarting efforts by activist investor <strong>Elliott </strong>to hire an external candidate.</p></li>  <li><p>Italy's state-controlled <strong>Monte dei Paschi di Siena</strong> has named <strong>UniCredit</strong> veteran <strong>Luigi Lovaglio </strong>as chief executive. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>TowerBrook</strong>, the private equity firm founded by former executives at&#xa0;<strong>Soros Fund Management</strong>, has promoted&#xa0;<strong>Jonathan Bilzin</strong>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<strong>Karim Saddi</strong>&#xa0;to co-chief executives.&#xa0;<strong>Ramez Sousou</strong>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<strong>Neal Moszkowski&#xa0;</strong>will continue as co-chairs of the firm and its investment committee.*</p></li>  <li><p><strong>MUFG</strong> has appointed <strong>Fabianna Del Canto</strong> as head of UK and non-EU capital markets, based in London.
