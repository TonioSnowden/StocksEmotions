  "text": "<p>To Death for Killing</p><p>A Pakistani court sentenced a man from a prominent industrialist family to death on Thursday, after finding him guilty of beheading a childhood friend who had refused to marry him. The ruling will likely be appealed.</p><p>Zahir Jaffar's killing of Noor Mukadam last year shocked the country. The verdict was quickly hailed by civil society groups.</p><p>The prosecution had alleged that Jaffar, 30, had a long-running friendship with Ms. Mukadam, 27, the daughter of a diplomat, but she rejected his romantic advances.</p><p>Jaffar, who has both Pakistani and U.S. citizenship, raped Ms. Mukadam before brutally murdering her, police said in reports submitted to the court during the trial.</p><p>Ms. Mukadam's family and friends along with human-rights activists organized a movement around her death, demanding justice, holding candlelight vigils, and launching a social-media campaign, #justicefornoor.</p><p>The trial shed light on the pervasiveness of violence against women in Pakistan. Hundreds of women are killed in Pakistan each year in similar cases, and the numbers of those subjected to violence and sexual assaults are growing.</p><p>Ms. Mukadam's father, Shaukat Ali, welcomed the verdict.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p><p>---</p><p>YEMEN</p><p>U.N. Says 13 Million</p><p>Face Food Shortage</p><p>The head of the United Nations food agency warned that 13 million Yemenis are headed for starvation due to a protracted civil conflict and a lack of funding for humanitarian aid.</p><p>Yemen is \"in a very bad situation,\" with more than 40% of the population already relying on food supplies from the World Food Program, David Beasley said, speaking from the capital, San'a. \"We're feeding 13 million people out of a nation of 30 million people, and we are running out of money,\" he added.</p><p>Since the coronavirus pandemic hit, more people have been facing the threat of starvation globally, which has put tremendous pressure on the WFP, Mr. Beasley said. Now, 285 million people around the world face the threat of starvation, making it more difficult to attend to Yemen's needs, he added. He said his agency was forced to cut rations in half for eight million Yemenis due to the shortage of funds.</p><p>According to the WFP, around 811 million people across the globe don't have enough food, and an estimated 45 million people in 43 countries are at risk of famine.</p><p>The WFP needs an extra $9 billion to meet the rising demand for food aid around the world, Mr. Beasley said.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p><p>---</p><p>THE NETHERLANDS</p><p>Apple Store Hostage</p><p>Taker Has Died</p><p>A gunman who held a hostage for hours in the Apple Store in Amsterdam before he was run over by police as he chased the hostage out of the shop died Wednesday evening, a spokesman for Amsterdam prosecutors said.</p><p>The man had demanded a ransom of 200 million euros, or the equivalent of $224 million, in cryptocurrencies during the five-hour standoff. The incident paralyzed one of Amsterdam's most popular nightlife neighborhoods on Tuesday, as dozens of heavily armed police surrounded the store, managing to free about 70 people from the building that houses the shop before the suspect was detained.</p><p>Police Chief Frank Paauw said the suspect, a 27-year-old man from Amsterdam armed with a handgun and an automatic weapon and wearing camouflage clothing, was run over by police as he chased his fleeing hostage.</p><p>The hostage was a Bulgarian man, police said. They didn't release his identity.</p><p>After the suspect was run over, a robot checked him for explosives as snipers in nearby buildings took aim, green laser beams from their weapons clearly visible in the night sky.</p><p>Mr. Paauw said the man was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p>",
