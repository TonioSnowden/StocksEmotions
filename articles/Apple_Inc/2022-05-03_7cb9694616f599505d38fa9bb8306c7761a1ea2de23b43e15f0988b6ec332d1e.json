  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>The European Commission is expected to finalise the <strong>sixth sanctions package</strong> on Russia, including a phased-in oil embargo by the end of the year, before submitting it to EU ambassadors for discussions tomorrow. We'll bring you up to speed with the latest and why Slovakia and Hungary may receive special treatment. </p> <p>A rival Italy-backed idea for an oil price cap seems to have garnered less support among capitals. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Mario Draghi is having his moment in the European parliament in Strasbourg later today and may field some questions from MEPs on Russian energy imports.</p> <p><strong>EU finance ministers</strong> are also gathering today, in virtual format — with the four candidates for the eurozone bailout fund having now been made official and a renewed push for completion of the banking union on the agenda.</p> <h2>Step by step</h2> <p>EU countries most dependent on Russian oil could be given more time to phase out imports as the commission seeks to forge a consensus behind a fossil fuel crackdown, write <em><strong>Andy Bounds and Sam Fleming in Brussels.</strong></em></p> <p>With the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1218d5d-b278-463d-8c1b-bd2da919d587\">expected to propose a phased-out ban</a> on Russian oil imports today, officials and diplomats told Europe Express that Hungary and Slovakia could be allowed to continue using Russian fuel for longer. It would be the first time since the invasion of Ukraine that the implementation of a key penalty on Russia is phased in differently across the EU.</p> <p>While member states generally favour the ban, in order to deprive Russian president Vladimir Putin of revenue for his war with Ukraine, some say they need more time to find alternative sources or build infrastructure.</p> <p>As energy ministers met in Brussels yesterday, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic all emphasised the need for help from other countries if they backed an embargo, while Germany warned starkly that the ban will hurt everyone. </p> <p>Karol Galek, state secretary of the Slovak economy ministry, told Europe Express that, as a landlocked country, it had few alternatives to Russian heavy crude oil.</p> <p>To convert its refinery to light oil would take four years and cost up to €250mn. The refinery also supplies Austria, the Czech Republic and Ukraine, he said. “We already delivered 4mn litres of fuel to Ukraine and we propose to deliver 10mn litres of diesel. For this we need to have the production . . . the flow through Druzhba.”</p> <p>If the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/865ee6bd-673e-4810-8726-6f7e007d5d0a\">Druzhba pipeline</a> from Russia were to shut down, Slovakia would only have enough oil for its own needs, he said.</p> <p>Jozef Sikela, Czech industry minister, said how fast it could drop Russian oil and gas depended on “how fast we can solve the technical problems”.</p> <p>“We are very much dependent on Russian supplies. We are a landlocked country and the solidarity of the neighbouring states is crucial. We need clear agreement on joint purchases and fair distribution. We have two pipelines&#xa0;and if one is interrupted we need to extend the capacity of the other.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>As for paying for Russian gas under the new system imposed by Putin, Slovakia does not have a payment for a few weeks so will watch what other countries do. </p> <p>Galek also said Slovakia wanted clearer guidance from the commission about using the Kremlin's system, which Brussels has said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa0d294b-0982-4f94-a327-a93300444083\">would breach sanctions</a>.</p> <p>“We will do what the whole EU agrees to do. The [commission] statements are not so clear. If there is a shortage of gas because Putin will close the pipes how will that be distributed? We will never go against sanctions. We need unity of all countries,” he said.</p> <p>Bratislava has just bought two shipments of liquefied natural gas, unloaded in Croatia, and hopes to receive more.</p> <h1>Chart du jour: US gas rush</h1> <p><em>France's state-backed utility Engie has signed up for natural gas from Texas in the </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/920881a4-e72f-4c7e-89d3-587a5d34e0c1\"><em>first US contract with a European buyer</em></a><em> since the war in Ukraine broke out and the continent accelerated its search for alternative gas supplies. Earlier talks between the two companies were put on hold in 2020 because of environmental concerns.</em> </p> <h2>Off to the races</h2> <p>Four candidates have thrown their hats into the ring for the post of the eurozone's next bailout chief, triggering a race to succeed Klaus Regling, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, writes <em><strong>Sam Fleming in Brussels.</strong></em></p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/05/02/statement-by-eurogroup-president-paschal-donohoe-on-the-candidates-for-the-post-of-esm-managing-director/\"> official announcement</a> suggests a healthy appetite prevails among member states to helm an institution that has recently been struggling to define a clear role for itself in the currency union's crisis-response infrastructure. </p> <p>The candidates, who were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd4d9a52-1e3a-4a81-bc19-1026a7d11ac2\">reported by Europe Express </a>last week, represent member states in both northern and southern Europe. As things stand, no immediate frontrunner has emerged for the post. </p> <p>Italy is the biggest member to back a candidate, throwing its weight behind Marco Buti, the chief of cabinet of EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni. His candidacy comes despite Rome's ambivalent relationship with the ESM: it has not yet ratified the updated ESM treaty and has in the past spurned its lending programmes. </p> <p>João Leão, who until recently served as Portugal's finance minister and is now a professor at University Institute of Lisbon, is the other southern European candidate in the running. </p> <p>The Netherlands is putting forward Menno Snel, a former state secretary of finance. </p> <p>And, instead of synching its position with The Hague, Luxembourg has fielded a rival candidate — Pierre Gramegna, the former finance minister. </p> <p>Ministers in the eurogroup want to finalise the succession this month, with the successful candidate confirmed in June. </p> <p>The topic comes alongside a fresh attempt by eurogroup president Paschal Donohoe of Ireland to revive the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b0b4970-1744-4d03-aea5-5c99779bff59\">EU's banking union project</a>, this time by tabling a draft work plan for pushing it forward. Ministers will hold a video conference later today for an initial discussion of the proposals. </p> <p>The draft plan spans a number of longstanding pieces of unfinished business within the banking union project.</p> <p>These are: strengthening the framework for managing failing banks; introducing more robust common protection for depositors; better integrating the single market for banking services; and boosting the diversification of banks' sovereign debt holdings. </p> <p>The idea is to push the project forward in two phases — with the commission coming forward with legislation for the first phase before the end of the year. This would include measures such as creating a common European deposit insurance fund, and boosting the monitoring and transparency of banks' sovereign debt holdings through stress-testing and enhanced disclosure requirements. </p> <p>Phase 2 of the plan would follow if consensus to proceed were to be reached among capitals. </p> <p>Pushing this work plan forward will be no mean feat given the existing divides between member states — notably Germany and Italy — on how and when to complete banking union. Today's meeting will give an early indication of whether the divisions are as entrenched as ever.</p> <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>Italian PM Mario Draghi speaks to the European parliament in Strasbourg</p></li>  <li><p>EU economy and finance ministers meet virtually</p></li>  <li><p>EU commission finalises sixth round of Russia sanctions for ambassadors to discuss tomorrow</p></li>  <li><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes part in the India-Nordic summit in Denmark </p></li> </ol> <h1>Notable, Quotable </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Pulling the plug: </strong>Finland's nuclear energy group Fennovoima has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e7730b5-be55-48a5-8f55-f67d6fb80d77\">terminated its contract</a> with Russia's nuclear giant Rosatom, with the war in Ukraine dealing a final blow to a controversial energy project in the country.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>India at G7:</strong> German chancellor Olaf Scholz, who received Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in Berlin yesterday, has invited him as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0e78415-66a7-4007-beb3-8dcc347c66b6\">special guest to the G7 leaders' summit</a> next month, as part of efforts to woo New Delhi away from its longstanding alliance with Russia. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Spying on Sánchez: </strong>The Israeli-built Pegasus spyware was used to hack the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e24bc019-7619-4f87-8518-cfea0f37210a\">mobile phones of Spain's prime minister and defence minister</a>, the Spanish government said yesterday in what is the first confirmed use of the espionage software against a serving head of government.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Apple charged: </strong>The EU commission yesterday charged Apple with breaking EU competition law by allegedly abusing its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de7a0c50-e087-4db3-9cb3-ed1d3c1a4b8b\">dominant position in mobile payments</a> to limit rivals' access to contactless technology.
