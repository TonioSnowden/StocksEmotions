  "title": "Technology:  Samsung  Expects  To Beat  Estimates  ----  By Timothy W. Martin and Kwanwoo Junin",
  "text": "<p>   Samsung Electronics Co. said it expects a 44% rise in operating profit for the first quarter, topping market expectations amid a global shortage of semiconductors and despite shutdowns of some U.S. chip-making facilities. </p><p>   The world's largest smartphone and memory-chip maker forecasts operating profit of 9.3 trillion South Korean won, equivalent to about $8.3 billion, during the first three months of the year. That compares with about 6.5 trillion won for the prior year's quarter. </p><p>   The South Korean firm also estimates revenue of 65 trillion won, up 17% from the prior year. </p><p>   Samsung's estimates topped analysts' forecast, gathered by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, of about 9.1 trillion won in operating profit and 61.4 trillion won in revenue. </p><p>   The tech giant reports full earnings this month. Samsung is considered a bellwether for the tech world, as it both makes major electronics products itself and supplies competitors, including Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., with components. </p><p>   Samsung and other semiconductor companies during the pandemic have benefited from a short-term boom for memory chips from data centers ramping up capacity and consumers buying more devices to shift to working from home. But now many buyers, including auto makers, have encountered delays trying to purchase semiconductors as economies start to reopen. </p><p>   The Biden administration is expected to meet next week with chip makers and other manufacturers, with Samsung a likely participant. </p><p></p>",
