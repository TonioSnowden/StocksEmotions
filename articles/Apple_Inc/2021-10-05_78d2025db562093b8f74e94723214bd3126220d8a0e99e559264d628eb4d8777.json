The technology sector was the third-worst-performing sector from Sept. 3 through Oct. 4, but it has been the clear leader from the end of 2019 through the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Dan Ives attributed the pullback in technology stocks to the fear of rising interest rates and concern over growth-stock valuations in a note to clients on Oct. 5. He went on to predict the pressure on tech stocks would be “short-lived” and that the sector would be up 10% from here through the end of 2021.</p><p>“[T]he tech growth stories are being massively underestimated by the Street inour opinion with 3Q earnings a major positive catalyst for the tech sector lookingahead,” Ives wrote.</p><p>The overwhelming tendency for companies reporting quarterly results to beat analysts' consensus estimates may well turn the analyst's prediction into reality in only a few weeks.</p><p>Ives sees a “multitrillion opportunity for the next decade” as the digital transformation of multiple industries continues. His favorite investments include Apple Inc. AAPL among the FAANG stocks. For plays on cloud computing, his favorites among large-cap stocks are Microsoft Corp. MSFT and DocuSign Inc. DOCU. Among large-cap companies poised for the best growth as cybersecurity threats are dealt with, Ives's top recommendations are Zscaler Inc. ZS, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW and Fortinet Inc. FTNT.</p><p>Biggest large-cap tech drops over the past month</p><p>To list tech stocks, we began with the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector and then added tech-oriented names in other sectors, such as Facebook Inc. FB, Twitter Inc. TWTR and videogame developers in the communications sector and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN in the consumer discretionary sector.
