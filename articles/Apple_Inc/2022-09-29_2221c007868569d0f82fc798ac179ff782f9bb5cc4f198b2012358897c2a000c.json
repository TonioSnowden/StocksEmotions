  "title": "Adani Enterprises: risks of following world's third-richest man",
  "text": "<p>The world's third-richest man has quietly but steadily ascended the ranks of billionaires over the past five years. One good reason is the stock market performance of Gautam Adani's holding company, which the Indian tycoon controls. It trades near record highs, having gained 3,300 per cent since 2019. Investors should query what backs this success.</p> <p>Adani Enterprises's market value has swelled 13 per cent in the past month ahead of its inclusion in the country's benchmark Nifty 50 index on Friday. The stock's surge in recent years make it hard to ignore, especially for global passive funds which track India as part of Asian or emerging markets indices. </p> <p>Even with that demand, the trading liquidity risk remains high. The company's free float percentage of traded shares is below 22 per cent, according to the company. Adani <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdc60a6f-9cd7-4fc5-872c-9b0e67bd657f\">announced this week</a> that he plans to increase this proportion, but gave no details about timing. </p> <p>Typically a float percentage anywhere below 50 per cent is considered low. In developed markets, the percentage is significantly higher. Apple is at nearly 100 per cent. A low float dissuades broker analysts from researching the group — only one local analyst does so — reducing demand from institutional investors.</p> <p>Adani's sprawling group has a complicated and opaque corporate structure ranging across 40 different businesses including edible oils, data centres, energy, cement and media. </p> <p>So much for conglomerate discounts. Adani Enterprises trades at 189 times forward earnings. More important, its net debt is 6 times estimated ebitda for the year to March. At a time of surging interest rates, that alone should give potential investors pause. The company claims that local and core foreign shareholders worry less about these valuations. </p> <p>Adani has benefited from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50758480-a908-4311-ae6b-402606bd668e\">good political connections.</a> Policy-driven, large infrastructure and renewable energy projects are partly responsible for group's rapid growth. But that adds political risk to its valuation. Should Adani fall out of favour with Narendra Modi's government, his conglomerate's debt-fuelled growth could well sputter.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Adani Enterprises: risks of following world's third-richest man' FT.com 29 September.
