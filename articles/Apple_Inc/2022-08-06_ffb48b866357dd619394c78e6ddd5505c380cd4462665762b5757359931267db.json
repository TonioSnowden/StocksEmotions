  "title": "EXCHANGE --- The Inside Story of Carlos Ghosn's Escape",
  "text": "<p>They had an important meeting outside Japan the following day, Mr. Taylor explained. From the little that Mr. Zayek contributed, he struck Ms. Tokunaga as blunt and disagreeable.</p><p>As their luggage was wheeled into the terminal, Ms. Tokunaga eyed the massive cases that she figured must contain amplifiers, even though they looked too large for the purpose.</p><p>She also saw a guitar case. Why were violinists carrying a guitar? Mr. Matsui and Ms. Tokunaga had been told the passengers were attending a concert by celebrated violinist Taro Hakase as guests, rather than as performers.</p><p>In reality, they were neither. Mr. Taylor had been hired to help Carlos Ghosn, the former chief of Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA, flee Japan, where he was facing serious criminal charges, having been accused of orchestrating a complex flow of money between Nissan, the Middle East, and his own pocket.</p><p>Mr. Ghosn, who has denied wrongdoing, had been the world's most prominent car executive of the 21st century. To the astonishment of naysayers worldwide, he had forged two middling car makers into a global powerhouse, the Renault-Nissan Alliance. Near the end of his career, he had been ready to push through his last great act as an executive -- a merger between the French and Japanese car makers.</p><p>By Mr. Ghosn's account, a plotting group of Nissan executives had prevented that by conspiring to orchestrate his downfall. His careful plans had been thwarted by a dramatic, unexpected arrest in November 2018. Nissan has said: \"The sole cause of this chain of events is the misconduct led by Ghosn.\"</p><p>In mid-2019, Mr. Taylor received a call from one of Mr. Ghosn's acquaintances asking whether he could mastermind an escape. Mr. Taylor roped in his old friend Mr. Zayek and also enlisted his son, Peter Taylor, to play a limited, supporting role in the scheme. The plan was to flee to Lebanon, where Mr. Ghosn had grown up and -- most important -- a country that did not extradite its citizens.</p><p>Now Mr. Ghosn, 65 years old, was out on bail while awaiting trial, which he feared would be unfair, he has said repeatedly. Furthermore, he believed the Japanese court process moved so slowly that he might die before a verdict was delivered. He was willing to risk everything for a chance at freedom.</p><p>This account is based on police interviews, security footage, bank statements and other documents, as well as interviews with people familiar with how the escape was conducted, including Mr. Ghosn himself.</p><p>On Dec. 29, 2019, Messrs. Taylor and Zayek landed in Japan to pull off the plan.</p><p>---</p><p>The men who had come to sneak Mr. Ghosn out of the country made about the least likely pair of violinists imaginable. Mr. Taylor looked like the former Green Beret that he was. Fitter than men half his age, with closely clipped salt-and-pepper hair and a square jaw, he was straight out of central casting.</p><p>Mr. Zayek painted an even more striking image. He openly bore the scars of his former life as a Lebanese militiaman. He was partially deaf in his left ear and partially blind in one eye and walked with a pronounced limp, the result of a leg injury decades ago.</p><p>From the airport, Messrs. Taylor and Zayek took two vans to the Star Gate Hotel, where they checked in at 11:12 a.m. Mr. Taylor was given room 4009, where hotel staff dropped off their suitcases and the guitar. Mr. Zayek checked into a room six floors above, to which hotel staff brought the two large black boxes.</p><p>---</p><p>Messrs. Taylor and Zayek hadn't determined whether they would get Mr. Ghosn out that day or if the whole exercise would turn into a dress rehearsal. As seasoned operatives, they tried to make sure that there would be no surprises or unpredictable scenarios on such a high-stakes, high-risk mission.</p><p>Just before noon, they flagged a taxi and headed for Shin Osaka Station. Mr. Zayek walked to the counter and purchased two tickets for Tokyo.</p><p>---</p><p>As Messrs. Taylor and Zayek were checking into their hotel room in Osaka, Mr. Ghosn was having a leisurely morning with his youngest daughter, who was 27. He packed some bags. Ms. Ghosn's return flight to the U.S. provided a convenient cover to send out some of her father's personal belongings ahead of his escape.</p><p>They went to lunch, probably for the last time in Tokyo. If anything went wrong, it would be the last meal Mr. Ghosn would eat outside a jail cell for a long time -- maybe forever. After lunch, they stopped by the house again to drop off Mr. Ghosn and pick up his daughter's luggage. Mr. Ghosn pushed five suitcases to the garage, where his driver was waiting. Ms. Ghosn told the driver that she had too much baggage and would need to drop some off for a friend to carry back to the U.S. Mr. Ghosn has said his own family played no role in the escape; his daughter hasn't been charged with a crime.</p><p>At 2:05 p.m., the car carrying Ms. Ghosn pulled up in front of the Grand Hyatt. She shook hands with the younger Mr. Taylor, who had checked in to the hotel the previous day, and he took two of her suitcases up to his room. She got back into the car and headed for nearby Haneda Airport.</p><p>---</p><p>At 2:30 p.m. precisely, Mr. Ghosn pushed open the front door of his two-story home and stepped outside. The moment before he crossed the threshold, he was Carlos Ghosn, revered auto executive fighting to clear his name. As soon as he stepped across it to execute his plan, at best he would become Carlos Ghosn the international fugitive. If he was caught, it would be back to jail, perhaps for the rest of his life.</p><p>Dressed in a dark jacket and scarf with a woolen cap and sunglasses, he walked west on the main road. He paused and looked over his shoulder before continuing. He had recently complained to a court that Nissan's security contractors spied on his every move.</p><p>Nissan wasn't the only monitor. Cameras had been installed outside and inside the foyer of the home by the court, checked once a week by the prosecutors. In addition, a constellation of security cameras on homes and buildings captured every step of Mr. Ghosn's 25-minute stroll to the Grand Hyatt.</p><p>Keeping his head down, he made his way through the lobby to the guest-room elevators. He got out on the ninth floor, walked down the hall, and entered room 933, where Peter Taylor was waiting.</p><p>---</p><p>The Nozomi express pulled into Shinagawa Station in Tokyo at 3:22 p.m. Michael Taylor and Mr. Zayek got off and boarded a taxi for the Grand Hyatt.</p><p>For more than 30 minutes Mr. Ghosn had been in Peter Taylor's room, where he'd changed clothes.</p><p>By the time Michael Taylor and Mr. Zayek reached the lobby of the Grand Hyatt, Peter was there waiting, having come down shortly before their arrival. When the two older men appeared, Peter immediately made for the elevator. The trio wanted to appear to be strangers in case the surveillance camera footage was reviewed. More than anything, Mr. Taylor wanted to ensure that his son wasn't seen as an accomplice.</p><p>Michael and Peter Taylor, along with Mr. Zayek, entered the ninth-floor room. It was the first time Mr. Ghosn had met his would-be rescuers face-to-face.</p><p>\"It's time to go home,\" Michael Taylor told Mr. Ghosn, greeting him with a large smile.</p><p>Seven minutes later, the four men left the room with Mr. Ghosn's luggage. Peter Taylor took a taxi to the airport, where he was booked on a flight to China. Michael Taylor wanted his son to get out of the country before anything potentially illegal happened. Messrs. Ghosn and Zayek and Michael Taylor left through the main entrance of the hotel and hailed a cab to Shinagawa Station. Mr. Ghosn now wore a pair of black, thick-rimmed glasses and a surgical mask, a common sight in Tokyo during flu season. The three men headed for the train platform.</p><p>Mr. Ghosn entered carriage 1 with Mr. Zayek. Michael Taylor entered carriage 2. The train left the station for Osaka at 4:55 p.m. Mr. Ghosn's face had been a fixture on TV and plastered on magazine covers for two decades. Seeing him there would be like spotting Steve Jobs on a New York City subway. Mr. Taylor had given him advice about how to behave, urging him not to speak in case people recognized his voice. Don't catch anybody's eye, he counseled. Keep walking, but look straight down to the ground.</p><p>The bullet train arrived at Shin Osaka Station at 7:20 p.m. The men filed out, walking in single file, a few paces apart: Michael Taylor, then Mr. Ghosn, then Mr. Zayek.</p><p>They piled into another taxi bound for the Star Gate Hotel. Once in the taxi, Mr. Ghosn, who had remained bundled up for nearly three hours on the train, removed his mask to take a few deep breaths of fresh air.</p><p>At 8:15 p.m., the trio walked through the entrance of the Star Gate Hotel. Messrs. Ghosn and Zayek went directly to the 46th floor, where the boxes were kept, while Michael Taylor went to the front desk before going to his room on the 40th floor, grabbing the guitar case before heading up to meet the others.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
