  "title": "Twitter employees blanch at prospect of Musk ownership; Musk would likely decimate Twitter's brand and reputation, say current and former employees",
  "text": "<p>Musk as the face of Twitter cheapens a brand carefully cultivated over years, groused one employee, who said, \"The idea of a figure like Musk taking over is horrifying for the company's reputation.\"</p><p>Added another worker: \"This all feels like a circus, a publicity stunt.\"</p><p>Another simply summed up the hostile bid as a \"s— show.\"</p><p>The pushback among the rank and file started when Musk announced in April that he had acquired 9.1% of the company's outstanding shares to become its largest shareholder, and has only intensified after his vow to transform Twitter into the world's \"platform for free speech\" with a bare-bones hostile bid of $43 billion. (Twitter called an all-staff meeting late Thursday. Later that day, Musk said at the TED 2022 conference, \"Having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.\")</p><p>But they all also are adamant the doomsday scenario is unlikely because the world's richest man and Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO made a shabby offer that Twitter's board is almost certain to reject.</p><p>\"The current offer is likely too low for TWTR's shareholders/Board to approve the deal at essentially the midpoint of 1-year trading range,\" Cowen analyst John Blackledge said in a note Thursday. \"TWTR also has several anti-takeover provisions in place.\"</p><p>Ultimately Musk's gambit, however serious, could force Twitter's board to consider other acquisition offers in addition to Musk's as part of its fiduciary duty.</p><p>That, in turn, could put Twitter in play for another corporate suitor, possibly Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. FB or a media conglomerate like Comcast Corp. CMCSA.</p><p>There is a catch to that storyline, though: Should any big tech company swoop in and scoop up Twitter, it would promptly meet resistance from either the Federal Trade Commission or Justice Department on antitrust grounds.</p><p>The FTC is currently locked in a legal battle with Facebook over its purchases of Instagram a decade ago and and of WhatsApp in 2014.</p><p>\"I think it is likely to run into far too many antitrust headwinds — and complicate matters for Google in ways they don't really want these days,\" Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, told MarketWatch.</p><p>One intriguing possibility is Apple Inc. AAPL, which, Chakravorti said, \"wants to move even further beyond TV into news and other content.\"</p><p>\"Apple has the resources to go into a bidding war with Musk,\" he said. \"It is also not likely to face the same antitrust roadblocks. I know Musk has said it is his last offer, but that man changes his mind all the time — mostly to keep the attention on himself and his Twitter feed.\"</p><p>Twitter employees blanch at prospect of Musk ownership</p>",
