The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 3.8 per cent by the end of next year, from 5.8 per cent in May.</p> <p>Fed chair Jay Powell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7982c61-3da6-4e02-a056-8b6116371d37\">struck an optimistic tone</a> about the pace of job creation, despite some near-term weakness. But he tried to stamp out any notion of a rapid acceleration towards monetary tightening, saying the dot plot of individual projections needed to be taken with a “grain of salt”.</p> <p>US government bonds sold off sharply after the Fed announcement, with the yield on five-year Treasuries jumping over 0.12 of a percentage point to 0.895 per cent. Global stocks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/227a5830-5ee6-4ba7-a021-59278e063df5\">dipped on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Robert Armstrong, author of the FT's daily markets email <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ed5bfb1-9398-4d16-8119-ca6d29e5e415\">Unhedged</a>, said Powell and his colleagues got the messaging just right. Colby Smith, our US economic editor, talked to today's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ae68841-c115-4b81-b08b-463b315a68e0\">New Briefing podcast</a> about the Fed's thinking and the market reaction.</p> <h1>Five stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Biden warns Putin of fallout if Alexei Navalny dies </strong>The US president warned that there would be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d99ae424-ef3f-443e-a9b7-bbbe729478f3\">“devastating” consequences</a> if the Russian <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1d0dfc4-3739-4cf9-9653-3ff26933367c\">opposition activist</a> died in prison. In the first face-to-face meeting of the pair as leaders, they agreed&#xa0;to begin bilateral talks on preventing cyber attacks, arms control, restoring their respective ambassadors and exploring potential prisoner exchanges, Putin said. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion: </strong>Biden's aim to coax Putin into a less dangerous stance is more difficult than it sounds, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9329ffae-e295-481e-af6e-1023e01edee4\">writes Edward Luce</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. US sues to block Aon's $30bn takeover of Willis</strong> The US Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03e1302-4091-4b11-a590-1c65358f0ab4\">has sued to block</a> Aon's takeover of Willis Towers Watson, threatening a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dafe0116-61f8-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68\">$30bn deal</a>&#xa0;intended to create the world's biggest insurance broker. Together with Marsh McLennan, Aon and Willis make up a trio that “dominate competition for insurance broking for the largest companies in the United States,” the DoJ said.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>3. Credit Suisse fights to stem exodus as top US dealmaker quits</strong> Greg Weinberger, who has run the mergers and acquisitions business at Credit Suisse since 2019, will join Morgan Stanley later this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/918bb064-1ea7-4cbf-91c5-081481376cb0\">people with direct knowledge of the matter said</a>. Weinberger is the latest defection from the Swiss bank which is battling to retain top talent following a series of scandals that have shattered employee morale.</p> <p><strong>4. HK police invoke security law to arrest senior journalists</strong> Hong Kong police have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ebdbf6c-315d-43c8-9b5e-dc6efc0af953\">arrested senior editors and executives</a> of a newspaper belonging to pro-democracy mogul Jimmy Lai in the first use of the territory's national security law directly against journalists. At least 500 officers were involved in the Thursday morning raid on Apple Daily, a popular tabloid.</p> <p><strong>5. US investors hunt for yield in junk-rated municipal debt</strong> Investors are pouring into the $4tn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac29c563-3549-4ef1-b896-dccf12f5d515\">US municipal bond market</a>, pushing yields on debt issued by state and local governments across the country to the lowest level on record.
