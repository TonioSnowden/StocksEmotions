  "title": "How José Andrés's World Central Kitchen Went to War; After 12 years in operation, the humanitarian organization knows how to mobilize quickly and adapt to all kinds of disasters. But the war in Ukraine presented a new set of challenges.",
  "text": "<p>The morning before Andrés told me this story, I'd already encountered Moldovan apples at a repurposed school in Irpin, a town outside of Kyiv that had seen one of the grisliest tank battles of the war. Local crews of cooks had been preparing free food there since March and relied on support from World Central Kitchen to feed thousands of people every day. And recently, each meal seemed to end with an apple. Around 10 tons of them had shown up out of the blue, the Irpin cooks said. They had no idea who sent them. \"That's from us,\" Andrés says. \"They were ours.\"</p><p>Moving untold numbers of apples across borders and around a war zone is only a small part of what has gone on since World Central Kitchen committed to helping Ukrainians face the food crisis created by the conflict. Not only is WCK constantly improvising to move supplies around the country, it's also supporting local cooks and organizers to prepare free hot meals and supply groceries while Ukraine holds off Russian forces. As one of the most nimble food nonprofits in the world, WCK estimates that by early October, it had already served over 165 million meals to Ukrainians.</p><p>In 12 years of rushing to humanitarian disasters around the globe, World Central Kitchen had never been to a war. The organization started when Andrés, 53, mobilized chefs and restaurants in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti and has continued deploying resources to catastrophes ever since. This was not a twist Andrés expected for his career when he was a young chef in Barcelona, or building an empire of more than a dozen restaurants across the U.S., or earning Michelin stars, or parading his magnetic personality and Spanish accent on cooking shows. Yet in Puerto Rico, following Hurricane Maria in 2017, Andrés found that WCK could mobilize some 20,000 volunteers, a fleet of food trucks and every available kitchen to produce 3.7 million meals, as chronicled in the Ron Howard documentary We Feed People. Running those operations in the midst of an armed conflict though? That was different—even if Andrés insists that every humanitarian disaster is trying to kill you, with or without bullets flying. The reminders have been stark. A WCK partner kitchen in Kharkiv was destroyed by a Russian shell in April. A train carrying 34 pallets of food supplies was hit in June.</p><p>Still, the basic ingredients that World Central Kitchen needed were unchanged. Everywhere it goes, the organization looks for three things: untapped food supply, willing local cooks and available kitchen capacity.</p><p>Here's what that looked like in Irpin. The kitchen is run by Oleksii Shpionov, a DJ and caterer who sent his wife and two children out of the country during the worst of the fighting. He stayed home out of a sense of national duty—besides, most adult men weren't allowed to leave the country. Then he started cooking.</p><p>When I met Shpionov in May, he'd been up at 6 a.m. every morning for three months without a day off. Soon after the invasion, he and a small team gathered whatever stock they could get their hands on from local markets, shops and farms and began delivering meals to a community where civilians had been gunned down in the street. With no outside support, they were able to make 600 meals a day. Once World Central Kitchen caught wind of their efforts and added them as partners (meaning WCK bought the meals at cost and paid the cooks for their time), it revolutionized their production. \"Without World Central Kitchen, it wouldn't happen,\" says Shpionov.</p><p>All over town, windows were still blown out. So was the highway bridge leading back to Kyiv, which Ukrainian forces themselves had destroyed to slow the Russian advance. But every day of the week, locals continued to file through for hot meals that consisted mostly of meat stews, potatoes and cabbage salad, plus a couple of apples on the way out. Ukrainian soldiers stopped by too, because the school cafeteria beat army rations. For those who couldn't get there, Shpionov's crew boxed up meals that went to hospitals and the army patrolling Irpin and nearby Bucha. As Shpionov likes to say, quoting Andrés, \"There are many ways to fight a war.\"</p><p>Shpionov has now been fighting this one for more than seven months, one enormous stew at a time. But with WCK backing his kitchen, one of hundreds scattered around Ukraine, Shpionov has no intention of slowing down. WCK tells him that it expects to stick around, offering logistics, know-how and funding, for as long as it takes.</p><p>\"We consider ourselves like the unofficial caterers of the event,\" Andrés says. \"If it was a wedding, we would stay till the end of the wedding.\"</p><p>Whenever Andrés opens WhatsApp on his phone, he sees a list of global humanitarian crises. He scrolls through one operations group chat after another of coordinators on the ground at emergencies where World Central Kitchen is currently deployed, from flooding in Asia to landslides in northeastern Brazil. Each one demands immediate attention. And in each spot, World Central Kitchen has people on the case.</p><p>In Bangladesh, one team has procured a helicopter to make drops in places unreachable by road. In Ukraine, one WCK affiliate is so eager to deliver groceries to towns at the front lines, he's requesting an armored vehicle. \"But we cannot give this guy an armored car,\" Andrés tells me. \"He's crazy. If we gave him an armored car, he would go through the [Russian] border!\"</p><p>That WCK can even consider the question of who needs a rental helicopter and who may or may not require armored vehicles is a testament to how far the organization has come. In 2020, the most recent year tax filings are available, the organization reported more than $250 million in donations. Those are driven by American private funding with some major corporate sponsors, but the bulk of contributions, according to WCK chief operating officer Erich Broksas, comes from individuals and a few high-net-worth donors. In 2021, the organization received another boost when Amazon founder Jeff Bezos awarded Andrés his Courage and Civility Award, which comes with a $100 million contribution to be used for charitable purposes.</p><p>With that kind of scale, the organization can activate at a moment's notice across entire regions. When Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico in September, WCK was already in place on the island, bracing for the storm; it did the same in Florida for Ian.</p><p>\"A lot of it is just showing up and moving quick and then trying to accumulate from there,\" Broksas says. \"And so it appears to be this large machine in the background making it happen, but it's the urgency of now and just finding the right people.\"</p><p>There is also the José factor. Though he makes a point of existing outside World Central Kitchen's organizational chart, any word out of his mouth immediately ripples into WCK action. An anti-bureaucrat, he defaults to incredulity at any hint of obstructionism or Excel spreadsheets or unused kitchen space—whatever might throw up hurdles between meals and the people who need them. If Andrés is \"working by committee,\" he says, \"nothing f—ing happens.\"</p><p>His impulse to head straight for the action often makes him elusive. (Andrés's wife and daughters follow his ever-changing itinerary through the live location of his iPhone.) In the first few days I spent trying to catch up with him in Ukraine, I made my way from the Polish border to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where I hoped to see him at one of the city's largest WCK partner kitchens. But as I moved ahead with that plan, he cooked up another route into the war zone, via Romania. He flew to Bucharest and then boarded a boat to sail along the Danube, into the Black Sea and then up to Odessa, a port city in southern Ukraine. If he could push even farther, all the way to Mariupol, he wanted to drop off meals and pick up refugees. Andrés, who served in the Spanish navy when he was 18, wasn't dissuaded by sea-mine alerts.</p><p>But what sea mines couldn't manage, the Russian navy did. Andrés hadn't realized that Russian ships patrolling the waters made Odessa impossible to reach. Never mind. Andrés pointed himself at Mykolaiv, a city three hours east of Odessa that had sustained shelling just days before. One of his first orders of business there was buying out an entire grocery store for WCK stocks.</p><p>When I finally caught up to him two days later, it was in Kyiv, an overnight train journey away from Lviv. Wandering around the empty streets of the capital, puffing on a Macanudo cigar, Andrés was on his third trip to Ukraine. His first came within 48 hours of the invasion, when he canceled a pair of events in Miami and made the journey to Europe. What he saw on his way were Ukrainians crossing back into the country to fight.</p><p>Within two weeks, WCK was at virtually every border outpost between Poland and Ukraine. And in Lviv, he had found Yuliya Stefanyuk, now the head of the World Central Kitchen Program in Ukraine. She operates out of a converted industrial space that wouldn't look out of place in Brooklyn or East London, a collection of former warehouses that house a concert space, a barbecue restaurant, a small-batch brewery—plus a catering company that, since March, has converted its space into one of WCK's largest bases in Ukraine. \"This is Ukrainians feeding Ukrainians,\" Andrés says.</p><p>Before she met Andrés, Stefanyuk had been working to redirect the caterer's kitchen space from producing hip, Instagrammable fare into meals that could be transported quickly to provide some comfort and nourishment to people fleeing the more violent areas in southern and eastern Ukraine.</p><p>\"How many meals can you prepare now?\" Andrés asked her, shortly after saying hello.</p><p>\"Five hundred a day,\" she replied.</p><p>\"We need 20,000.\"</p><p>From the company's network of restaurants, Stefanyuk borrowed staff, equipment and expertise. Her kitchens in the city were soon churning out up to 34,000 daily meals, she says. On a sunny afternoon in May, one team was spooning out hearty bowls of sausage, couscous, potatoes, wheat and carrots at a rate no one working there had ever seen. \"This is not hard, but it's more portions,\" a 27-year-old line cook from Lviv said. \"In a restaurant, maybe you put 25 grams of something. In this kitchen, that pot can hold 100 liters.\"</p><p>Dinners went into bowls and bowls went into boxes 60 at a time. A shipment was ferried that afternoon to the sports hall at the Lviv Polytechnic National University, the city's largest center for displaced people. Helped by student volunteers, people primarily from the east and south of the country had been bunking on a basketball court and inside a table-tennis gym.</p><p>\"First of all, they need support—support and understanding—not really things,\" says one of the university's student volunteers, Alina Yarosh, who has been helping to look after refugees since the start of the war. \"Then they need water.\"</p><p>And they need a decent meal. WCK says it provides more hot meals than any other nongovernmental organization in Ukraine—and Andrés insists they taste better too. These aren't army rations or dehydrated noodles and powder. Wherever possible, it's Ukrainian food prepared by Ukrainian people.</p><p>The initial bite of WCK food many people arriving in Lviv encountered was a cup of bograch outside the train station. Prepared in a 92-gallon cauldron on the street, the stew containing \"many meats and many vegetables,\" as one cook puts it, has been on the boil effectively since the invasion. In the beginning, they went through seven or eight cauldrons a day.</p><p>Elsewhere, the first meal might be a simple sandwich, whether it's picked up from a roving food truck or waiting at one of the border crossings. At the facility in Lviv, they are put together at a pace of one every 22 seconds. The secret is a 15-foot conveyor belt that one of Stefanyuk's teams was able to borrow and repurpose from a pet-food-bagging operation.</p><p>These days, it snakes between 10 people working like an aproned-and-hairnetted automobile assembly line. With automatic gestures, repeated thousands of times, it goes: slice of bread, squirt of mustard, salami, cheese, pickle and more bread, give or take a couple of ingredients that may or may not be at hand. At one point, the sandwich makers said, they received a large, unexpected shipment of prosciutto—440 pounds of surprise lunch meat. So for a few days prosciutto sandwiches hit the menu. It was the Moldovan apples all over again.</p><p>World Central Kitchen pulls the strings, but as long as the food shows up, nothing matters other than producing more meals with staff thrown straight into the deep end.</p><p>\"We weren't ready,\" says Solomia Ivanyshyn, a 21-year-old who was used to mixing fancy drinks and cocktail bites before the war. Now she was transferring huge vats of mustard into piping bags. \"Nobody was ready to change jobs in one day.\"</p><p>In WCK's early days, Andrés enlisted the people he knew best: other chefs. Then the organization's experiences in a variety of emergency situations—not just places where a hurricane or a flood has knocked out the power network—helped WCK arrive at a game-changing realization. Not every meal it provided had to be cooked, or even assembled. In Ukraine, groceries could be just as useful. So from a hulking warehouse in Kyiv, the largest of eight around the country, WCK has been shipping out bags of daily essentials by the thousands. Each grocery kit, full of coffee, sugar, flour, pasta and tinned food, can feed three people for a week.</p><p>Putting them together requires another conveyor belt—only this warehouse doesn't actually have a belt. Dozens of staff members pace around carrying bags while someone at each station drops in another item. Initially, before WCK was involved, they were pumping out 1,000 packages a day. That soon increased to 6,000 and eventually 18,000 per day.</p><p>The secret to making it work, Andrés says, is leaning on people who are already doing things—people like Tatiana Shulyak. On the first day of the war, she heard from the owner of a local cafe who had to shut down but still had a refrigerator full of fresh produce. Come over and eat, the owner told her, and bring your friends.</p><p>Shulyak spread the word. And with the news of free food went her phone number. Within days, she says, she was a point person for hundreds of people trying to track down spare stock from restaurants, cafes and supermarkets. By the end of the week, she had 10 restaurants preparing food for local hospitals and Ukrainian soldiers. \"Everything happened so quickly, I had no time to think of reasons why I shouldn't do this,\" she says.</p><p>Connection followed connection until Shulyak, a volunteer in the right place at the right time, found herself talking to the British Consulate. That's who put her in touch with WCK, which didn't take long to sign her up. Then again, it never does.</p><p>\"They're good, they're smart…. What am I going to do, send human resources to check if they're prepared?\" Andrés says. \"People are hungry. Just put f—ing food out in the early days and we'll figure it out later.\"</p><p>If WCK has learned anything from its time in Ukraine, it's that the organization could get better at codifying what it does, writing down all of its local knowledge to establish blueprints for the future. At the same time, the power of WCK is its adaptability. In Romania, it was able to build a kosher kitchen for a community of 1,000 Jewish people displaced from Odessa. In Mykolaiv, WCK brought in a huge kitchen on wheels with the ultimate aim of driving it to Mariupol.</p><p>And in Kyiv, WCK plied the chefs at one hip eatery in the city center with a food truck that could generate 10,000 portions a day at full capacity. The plan was for the young restaurateurs—a motley trio dressed in baggy skateboard pants with tattoos on their knuckles and rolled cigarettes between their fingers—to drive it east, as close as possible to the front lines. It wasn't exactly how they expected to spend their summer when they were still inventing Asian-Italian fusion dishes a few months earlier. But like Andrés says, there are many ways to fight a war.</p><p>\"You need to conquer the enemy,\" he adds. \"The enemy is pessimism, hunger and the not-possible.\"</p><p>How José Andrés's World Central Kitchen Went to War</p>",
