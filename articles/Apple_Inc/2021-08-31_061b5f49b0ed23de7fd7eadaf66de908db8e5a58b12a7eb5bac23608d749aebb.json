  "title": "Stocks Edge Lower, but Finish August With Gains; S&P 500 hovers near its all-time high and finishes the month up nearly 3%",
  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished the month higher, gaining 1.2% for August and notching its second consecutive monthly gain. The Nasdaq Composite added 4% for August, its third consecutive monthly win.</p><p>Stocks spent most of August largely drifting higher, lifted by strong second-quarter earnings results and thin trading volumes. Throughout the month, all three indexes notched multiple records. Most recently, investors emerged with fresh optimism after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized again that the central bank shouldn't overreact to this year's inflation surge.</p><p>Concerns about pricing pressures have percolated throughout the market for much of this year, as prices of items ranging from used cars to lumber have surged. But Mr. Powell, speaking Friday, argued that signs of inflation still appear likely to reverse on their own. He also reaffirmed the Fed's emerging plan to begin scaling back the central bank's bond buying later this year, emphasizing that officials have set a \"different and substantially more stringent test\" for raising rates than they have for the \"coming reduction in asset purchases.\"</p><p>\"The fact that the Fed is willing to start to taper in the face of this Delta variant coming through does suggest they have confidence that the economy is going to stand on its own two feet,\" said Peter Langas, chief portfolio strategist at Bessemer Trust.</p><p>For the Tuesday session, the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.11 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 4522.68. The Dow lost 39.11 points, or 0.1%, to end at 35360.73. The Nasdaq Composite edged down 6.65 points, or less than 0.1%, to 15259.24. All three indexes are hovering within striking distance of their August records.</p><p>In the days and weeks ahead, investors will be monitoring rising coronavirus cases and hospitalizations due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Money managers say the variant presents a potential headwind for stocks, particularly if consumer spending retreats or if new restrictions that could weigh on the economic recovery are imposed. Fresh data from The Conference Board Tuesday showed that consumer confidence in the U.S. deteriorated in August, retreating to its lowest level since February.</p><p>\"You have seen people canceling vacations or not going out to restaurants\" due to the Delta variant, said Mr. Langas. \"There is this concern on the margin that we are seeing people pull back a bit. All of that comes into play in regards to where consumer confidence is going in the short term.\"</p><p>Later this week, investors will be parsing the latest jobs report to better understand the state of the labor-market recovery. A survey compiled by The Wall Street Journal shows that economists expect employers in August to have added 720,000 jobs. Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 943,000 in July, marking the best gain in 11 months.</p><p>Among the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors, only four—the real estate, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and communication services groups—traded higher Tuesday. Shares of many technology companies pulled back, one day after the group helped power the market higher. Chip-makers including NXP Semiconductors NV, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices fell. Apple lost $1.29, or 0.8%, to end at $151.83.</p><p>Zoom Video Communications tumbled by $58, or 17%, to close at $289.50, its largest percentage decrease since November after the videoconferencing company's adjusted earnings guidance came in lower-than-expected. Though on Monday the company reported that its second-quarter revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, Zoom officials said some metrics boosted by the pandemic had begun to normalize.</p><p>In other individual equities, shares of Support.com fell by $5.03, or 14%, to $31.36 after surging 38% Monday. Its shares have rocketed in the last week as individual investors have piled in and tried to execute a short squeeze on the stock.</p><p>Robinhood Markets ticked up 68 cents, or 1.6%, to $44.32. On Monday, the stock tumbled after Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler signaled he was open to banning payment for order flow, a practice that accounts for most of the company's revenues.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.303%, from 1.284% on Monday, snapping a four-month losing streak. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Futures on Brent crude for October delivery fell 0.6% to $72.99, marking a 4.4% loss for the month. Brent crude is the international benchmark in energy markets.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 slid 0.4% for the day, but ended the month up 2%.</p><p>For the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.1%, and 3% for the month. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index gained 1.3% for the day, but ended the month down 0.3%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Will Horner at William.Horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Edge Lower, but Finish August With Gains</p>",
