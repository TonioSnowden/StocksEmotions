  "title": "Technology:  Universal Music Strikes App Deal  ----  By Anne Steele",
  "text": "<p>    Vivendi SE's Universal Music Group has licensed the world's largest music catalog to Equinox Media LLC's Variis digital fitness app, allowing users to work out at home to hits by Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and the Weeknd. </p><p>   The agreement comes as the music industry increasingly looks to new partners across social media, videogames and fitness for revenue beyond streaming. The pandemic has accelerated the growth of at-home fitness apps, which have relied on music as a draw to live-streamed and on-demand classes led by remote instructors -- who have become much like influencers and DJs in their own right. </p><p>   While streaming on music services like Spotify and Apple Music has increased during pandemic lockdowns, closed venues, restaurants and retailers where music is played, as well as the pause on touring and live shows, have weighed on the music business. At the same time, videogaming, social video on apps like TikTok and digital fitness have taken off -- each with opportunities labels, publishers and other copyright owners are eyeing for music. </p><p>   The digital fitness market has taken off with Peloton Interactive Inc.'s stationary bikes, Lululemon Athletica Inc.'s purchase of Mirror, Apple Inc.'s introduction of Fitness+, as well as upstarts like Supernatural VR and Hydrow. </p><p>   Equinox Media launched its Variis mobile app in March, giving Equinox bricks-and-mortar gym members free access to virtual classes just as stay-at-home orders and lockdown restrictions were sweeping through cities across the country. It also began selling its SoulCycle at-home bikes for $2,500. In October, Variis became nationally commercially available to nonmembers for $40 a month. </p><p>   The app offers classes across the SoulCycle, Pure Yoga, Rumble Boxing, Precision Run and Equinox brands, plus other partner brands. While SoulCycle and Equinox classes are streamed live from clubs in New York, on-demand classes are filmed in the studio that was previously home to \"The Daily Show,\" and are intended to be cinematic, says Equinox Media Chief Executive Jason LaRose. </p><p>   Most everything -- pedaling, punching, kicking, squatting, running -- is done to the beat of music, which helps translate the in-person experience to a digital format. </p><p>   \"These classes are like going to a concert -- 60 people in the dark rocking back and forth, riding together to the beat, boxing sequences to the rhythm,\" says Mr. LaRose. \"It's our job to re-create the real-life experience where we can in an on-demand world.\" </p><p>   \"Music is a key part of what looks like is going to be a booming digital fitness market,\" says Michael Nash, Universal's executive vice president of digital strategy. </p><p>   The global digital fitness market is estimated to explode from about $6.7 billion in 2017 to $27.4 billion by 2022, according to investment bank Lincoln International. Through licensing music to services such as Variis, the revenue for music will match that pace of growth, Mr. Nash says. </p><p></p>",
