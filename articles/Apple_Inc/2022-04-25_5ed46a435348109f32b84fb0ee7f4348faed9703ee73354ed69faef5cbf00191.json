  "text": "<p>It is well-established that in murder mysteries the culprit is always the person you'd least suspect — the one who wouldn't hurt a fly. But Apple TV Plus' <em>Shining Girls</em> wastes little time in confirming that the sinister man we see tearing the wings off an insect is indeed a psychopathic serial killer. </p> <p>An adaptation of Lauren Beukes's chiller, the crime series is all too happy to dispense with whodunnit plotting, confident that its slippery, reality-shifting narrative will keep viewers guessing at what's happening — and feeling as disorientated as its protagonist. </p> <p>She is 30-something Chicago-resident Kirby Mazrachi (the ever-watchable Elisabeth Moss). A survivor of a horrifying assault four years earlier, she lives with an extreme form of PTSD which inhibits her ability to remember basic things about her life or even perceive people and places as they actually are. “Things change, they're not how I left them, nothing is where it should be,” she vents one night to her mother (Amy Brenneman), who she lives with. But the next time she comes home she finds that her apartment looks different, and there's no trace of her mother. Instead, she's confronted with a group of people who've come to celebrate a birthday for a husband that she didn't know she had. Rarely has a surprise party been quite so surprising.</p> <p>When the body of another woman is found bearing the same wounds as Kirby — who was cut in a distinctive, and particularly grisly fashion — she uses every snatched moment of lucidity to try to track down the assailant. Handily, she works as an archivist at the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, where Dan Velazquez (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6625dc86-70a9-11e6-9ac1-1055824ca907\"><em>Narcos</em>'</a> Wagner Moura), a maverick investigative journalist, is also tracking the case in the hope of landing a scoop that will revive his fading career. All the while, the killer (a convincingly unnerving Jamie Bell) stalks his next victim. </p> <p>A suspenseful and well-executed first episode keeps things the right side of enigmatic and may evoke memories of Christopher Nolan's twisty amnesia thriller <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4cfb3be-7dad-11e7-ab01-a13271d1ee9c\"><em>Memento</em></a>. But as the plot opens up in the following two episodes and supernatural elements intrude, <em>Shining Girls</em> starts to become frustrating and unwieldy. What remains controlled is Moss's performance. Her embodiment of a woman's quiet, resilient desire to take ownership of her pain is the truly memorable aspect in this intriguing but largely forgettable show.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>Episodes 1-3 on Apple TV Plus from April 29; new episodes released weekly</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Elisabeth Moss is brilliant in serial-killer thriller Shining Girls ' FT.com 25 April.
