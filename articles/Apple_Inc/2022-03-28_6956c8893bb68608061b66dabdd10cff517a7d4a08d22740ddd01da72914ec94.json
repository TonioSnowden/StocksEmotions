The 5-year Treasury yield briefly traded above the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond, temporarily inverting that measure of the curve. The 2-year yield remains below the 10-year yield, but a rise above the longer-term rate would be seen as signaling a possible recession.“Our base case is that the US economy can avoid a recession, lowering the threat of a sustained downtrend in stocks,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note. “Investors should brace for higher rates — including potentially adding exposure to value and financial stocks which tend to outperform as central bank policy tightens — without overreacting by exiting equity markets.”“We favor selected equity overweight and underweight positions, resulting in a neutral overall stance on the asset class,” he said.</p><p>In One Chart:Some stock market ‘complacency creeping in' after S&amp;P 500's ‘near-perfect retracement' of selloff</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 needs to close above 4,587.77 to exit a market correction, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The large-cap benchmark entered a correction on Feb. 22, when it closed more than 10% below its record finish from Jan. 3. A correction is defined as a fall of more than 10%, but less than 20%, from a recent peak. An exit would occur when the index rises 10% from its correction low.</p><p>See:Perfect contrarian indicator?
