  "text": "<p>Twenty-five years ago, a Japanese businessman began to offset his company's carbon by funding a landscape to last for a thousand years. The project is bold and fascinating, with a head start on all the wilding and replanting that are now hot news. The carbon to be offset is generated by his business as a newspaper publisher. </p> <p>What can the FT set beside his offsetting? I will return to an answer at the end.</p> <p>Hokkaido is a northern island of the Japanese archipelago, off the coast of Russia. Below the Hidaka mountains, Mitsushige Hayashi began in 1990 to acquire about 1,000 acres of ground, farmed and felled since its life as a forest for Ainu hunters and gatherers over many thousands of years. </p> <p>He ordered a master landscape plan for it in 1996 and had the vision and patience to employ landscape architects, experts in forest management, first-class gardeners and, since 2000, Britain's own Dan Pearson, admired for his gold medals at the Chelsea Flower Show.</p> <p>At the FT Weekend Festival in September 2019, I shared a platform with Pearson. When we fielded an early question about the use of disease-prone box hedging in British gardens, his answer surprised me: he avoided using it because landscape architects have to think ahead for hundreds of years. </p> <p>Gardeners think only in decades, but I now understand his reply. He had learnt the long view from projects such as the Tokachi forest, about which he has now co-written an intriguing book.</p> <p>When the forest area was bought, its foreground had become farmland. Parts of the fine woodland on the hills had been felled and replaced with quick-growing larch trees. The change of canopy had changed the wild plants on its floor. An invasive type of bamboo, sasa, had begun to run far and wide. Once-lovely wild plants such as anemones, cardiocrinums and localised forms of monkshood were in retreat.</p> <p>The forest managers ordered the bamboo to be strimmed yearly, taking it down to ground level. Within five years it was tamed, a lesson for fellow bamboo sufferers. The previous flora then began to reappear from seeds that had been lying buried under the bamboo's stems. </p> <p>The woodland had great potential, with oaks, magnolias and much else, but wooden duckboards, those hallmarks of Japanese landscape parks, had been laid to guide visitors a little way into it, towards artwork by Yoko Ono.</p> <p>The landscape deserved better and needed to be pulled together. Pearson's brief was to link the surrounding land more appealingly to the forest and give visitors to its existing café much more to look at than a goat farm and a field for horses. </p> <p>He began with some clever earth shaping, which transformed a flat pancake of land into a pattern of advancing and receding hillocks so that it picked up the mountain's foothills beyond. Nearer to the café, flowery gardens and productive beds were felt to be appropriate, and here he made some interesting choices.</p> <p>The climate here makes Northumberland's seem benign. Winter begins in late October and ends in late April. Temperatures drop to a low of minus 20C, but the snowfall is so powdery that taller plants remain above it, exposed to frost. </p> <p>Although spring is extremely brief, water is not a problem. On the open ground there are seams of water, accessible to plants' roots. They grow rapidly in the hot, humid summer.</p> <p>Like Pearson, I would have scouted the surrounding landscape and majored on local Japanese plants. They are often so lovely, white-flowered gillenias, tall forms of angelica and even the superb golden-rayed lily, Lilium auratum, growing wild. However, he needed more variation and at times more impact.</p> <p>The Tokachi forest is linked to a Hokkaido trail of other gardens open to visitors, most of which use touches of English or western style. Pearson decided to thicken his meadow plantings with appropriate non-Japanese plants and to enliven the café garden with roses recommended by Britain's David Austin. </p> <p>The productive beds would be laid out as raised rectangles, edged by timber as thick as railway sleepers, a frequent resource for vegetable growers in western Europe.</p> <p>Into the meadows came violet-blue herbaceous salvias, swaths of yellow- flowered Achillea Coronation Gold, daisy-flowered Coreopsis Zagreb, tall valerian, baptisias and, near the paths, the rose-purple dianthus that was once at home on Europe's Carthusian monasteries. Sweeps of brown grasses, Calamagrostis Karl Foerster to the fore, divide up many of the drifts of colour.</p> <p>It may sound as if euro-grass from Gardens Illustrated magazine has landed in a Japanese island off Russia, and from pictures it is hard to judge, especially as some of the photos in the book are oddly dark. Pearson, however, can think on the grand scale. Beyond yet more duckboards, there are spectacular drifts of stems and changing colours, spanning the visitors' year. </p> <p>His text identifies each of the mixes of plants he has devised. Gardeners keen to wild their own bit of rough garden have much to learn from this part of the book.</p> <p>By the café, David Austin's expert Michael Marriott recommended <br>50 varieties of rose from his global experience, those that survive very harsh winters. The species Rosa glauca has been an unexpected failure but 40 of the others have flourished, including some of Austin's own English roses. </p> <p>In timber-edged beds, dahlias, even, and elegant nicotianas give late summer the lift that they also give England's home counties. Under well-chosen flowering crab trees there are drifts of blue-flowered camassias, much as in an enlightened orchard in Sussex.</p> <p>In 2008 alone, 35,000 plants were needed for the meadow. Pearson located an important ally, Mr Omori of the Omori garden near Hiroo, with whom he was able to find and test major items for his design. Planting on such a scale needs devoted attention and updating, as its salvias last only three to five years, its dots of red echinacea have to be renewed annually and its thermopsis plants turned out to be thugs.</p> <p>In 2016, much of the site was swamped in a typhoon. Fortunately, Midori Shintani had joined the team in 2008, to become head gardener extraordinaire of this vast project. She is co-author of the new book and describes herself as a person of opposites, trained in Japan but also in Sweden, and fluent in English. </p> <p>She is plainly a superb gardener, whose exceptional skills, dexterity and dedication I salute. With her assistant Shintaro Sasagawa, she stops a complex variety becoming a mess.</p> <p>She inspires me, reading in lockdown, but what about that other carbon-shedding newspaper, the FT? I am ready and waiting for a winter of offsetting on, say, a hillside in sunny central Madeira, but the FT's record is already oddly good. When I joined in 1970, ingredients for its pink paper were being sourced from the clay pits of English China Clays in Cornwall. </p> <p>Technology changed, and ECC disappeared, taking my loyal shares with it. The pits, however, persisted. They have become the site of the Eden Project, Britain's most publicised eco-garden. If we meet, I can still look Shintani honestly in the eye.</p> <p><em>“Tokachi Millennium Forest” by Dan Pearson and Midori Shintani (Filbert, £40)</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.
