Legendary guitar maker legend Fender has been rolling out models on its Acoustasonic line for a few years now, but the new Player Telecaster is the first priced to appeal to a wider audience of pickers and pluckers. It's what you'd imagine—an electric guitar that sounds great unplugged—but because of some fancy electronics and digital signal processing, it does more, emulating a spectrum of classic acoustic and electric guitars when plugged into an amp. $1,200; fender.com</p><p>Amazon Fire TV Omni Series</p><p>This Amazon-branded TV—the company's first—has hands-free Alexa built in. It works just like your Echo speaker: You can ask it what the weather is like tomorrow, for example. But you can also say \"Alexa, turn on the TV,\" to light up the vivid 4K display. Voice control means you can ask Alexa to play \"Shang-Chi\" on Disney+ or turn down the volume, but you'll still need the remote for some tasks, such as inputting passwords. Impressively, Alexa heard us even during loud action sequences. Soon, you'll be able to share media through AirPlay, join meetings on Zoom and wirelessly pair Echo speakers to create a home-audio system. The TV is available in five sizes, ranging from 43 to 75 inches. $300 and up; amazon.com</p><p>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2</p><p>Do you use cloud-based services for work or school? Live in Google's ecosystem? You could save money by switching to Chrome OS for your next computer. The first thing you'll notice about Samsung's Galaxy Chromebook 2 is its vivid high-definition screen, ideal for YouTube and Netflix enthusiasts. The second thing you'll notice is that it can fold up into a tent shape, ideal for that streaming video. The Chromebook has a sleek metal design and the keys, while shallow, are satisfyingly bouncy. $549 and up; bestbuy.com</p><p>InCase Nylon Accessory Organizer</p><p>Yes, officially, this is an \"accessory organizer\" but there's really only one name for it: dongle bag. And in our new world, where we hop from home to office and back again, you don't leave home without one. This InCase is one of our favorites. Mesh pouches are a perfect fit for AirPods, a travel mouse and other little adapters. For more work-from-home-or-office gift ideas, check out our complete guide. $50; incase.com</p><p>Belkin Wemo Wi-Fi Smart Outdoor Plug</p><p>With all due respect to Clark Griswold, the easiest way to manage your holiday lights—even if you're out of town during the holidays—is with a smart outdoor plug. The new two-socket Wemo model was easy to set up in a few minutes, and was instantly compatible with the major smart-home interfaces from Apple, Amazon and Google, plus its own Wemo app. Belkin says it's splash-proof and weather-resistant, and we were able verify that claim during some pretty nasty fall storms. $40; belkin.com</p><p>Wristcam for Apple Watch</p><p>If you begrudgingly carry your phone on runs or hikes just so you can capture the views, consider a Wristcam. This souped-up Apple Watch band has two built-in photo/video cameras. The 8-megapixel \"world-facing\" camera even snaps underwater up to 1 meter deep. There's also a selfie camera, and you can do live video messaging, though that gets a bit complicated. The image quality isn't iPhone grade (see samples on Instagram), but it'll do for getting quick shots when a phone would be too cumbersome or risky. $299; wristcam.com</p><p>Sonos Roam Portable Speaker</p><p>Most portable speakers stay in a closet until needed, along with other just-for-outdoors gear. The water- and drop-resistant Sonos Roam is different: It can play audio over Bluetooth and work seamlessly with your at-home AirPlay 2 or Wi-Fi-enabled Sonos setup too. It might take a while to get used to the speaker's multiple button controls and status lights. Still, the burrito-size device produces clear, well-balanced audio and makes for an ideal Alexa-powered shower companion. $179; sonos.com</p><p>Lockly Flex Touch Smart Deadbolt</p><p>Simplicity is key with this new deadbolt from Lockly. It doesn't have a keypad or facial recognition, like some of the company's fanciest models. This Home Depot exclusive is just a key lock with a fingerprint scanner, so you can unlock a door the way you unlock the other digital devices in your life. (Or the way you used to unlock them, anyway.) Installation and setup are easy with the app, and if you have other Lockly locks, you can transfer your settings over. $149; homedepot.com</p><p>Apple M1 24-inch iMac</p><p>A desktop computer for the whole family! What is this, 1994? Powered by Apple's M1 chip, this all-in-one is kin to iPad and iPhone. With a body as thick as three slices of American cheese, the M1 stays cool and quiet no matter what you do on the beautiful 4.5K display. The toughest decision? Which of the seven colors to pick. Matching mouse and keyboard included, but if you buy the base model, spend the extra $50 for a Touch ID keyboard. $1,299 and up; apple.com</p><p>Mila Smart Air Purifier</p><p>Between Covid-19, wildfires and seasonal allergies, there are many reasons to get an air cleaner. A Wi-Fi enabled one isn't a must-have, but it is more convenient than an analog, manual-control one. Mila pairs a HEPA filter for trapping airborne particles and viruses with activated carbon for removing odors and chemical fumes. It automatically adjusts fan speed based on readings from its on-device sensors. Burned toast? You'll hear Mila start whirring in the background. A \"Housekeeping Service\" deep cleans while you're away, so your home is fresher upon your return. $349; milacares.com</p><p>Platin Monaco 5.1 Wireless Speaker System</p><p>Soundbars are popular in home theaters because they're so simple and compact. Having real movie sound requires speakers all around you, but turning your home into a web of wires...well, no. Platin's Monaco 5.1 system—that's five speakers and a subwoofer—uses a wireless technology that can transmit high-resolution audio with essentially no latency. Essentially no setup, either: You plug them in, connect your TV to the transmitter via HDMI cable, and everything just works. $999; platin.com</p><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G</p><p>For the first time since its introduction two years ago, Samsung's folding phone won't ruin your holiday. In fact, you'll be the life of the holiday party. First, show everyone how your phone opens like a book to become a 7.6-inch Android tablet. Then wow them by running apps side by side on the screen. Then stick the device under some running water, because it's now water resistant. Finally, grab your S Pen ($50 extra) and play some Tic-Tac-Toe. $1,800 and up; samsung.com</p><p>BioLite AlpenGlow 250 Portable Light</p><p>For camping or the occasional power outage, this rechargeable, water-resistant, mug-sized lamp has three basic controls: press, press-and-hold and shake. Once you learn the combos, you can enable eight different dimmable lighting modes from multicolor to warm white. Our favorite? Two button presses and a shake produce a warm candle flicker. The big built-in battery can run for up to 200 hours on low, or top up your phone battery or other devices. $60; bioliteenergy.com</p><p>Microsoft Surface Pro 8</p><p>Upgrading your current computer to Windows 11 may be a roll of the dice, but starting fresh with a Surface Pro 8 is a sure thing. This year's version of Microsoft's tablet-keyboard combo has a thinner, more modern design, an improved high-resolution display and support for the new Surface Slim Pen 2, with a haptic motor to make it feel like you're writing on paper, not glass. Sadly, the Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and that pen are add-ons that will set you back an extra $280. $1,100 and up; microsoft.com</p><p>Larq Pitcher PureVis</p><p>Yes, the Larq is on the spendy side for a water pitcher, but if you've ever been guilty of growing algae in yours, consider it. In addition to the pollutant-removing filtration, it blasts water with UV-C light, killing bacteria and viruses that might slip through. The company says it's working on ways to reduce customer costs, including through subscriptions. A new app tracks your water use and can help calculate how long you can go between filter changes. $148; livelarq.com</p><p>SteelSeries Apex 3 TKL Water-Resistant Gaming Keyboard</p><p>This keyboard was designed for gamers, but it's really for anyone who enjoys fun lighting schemes and occasionally spills beverages. The smaller of the new Apex 3 models offers quiet, satisfying typing and customizable multicolored LED lights. (You can get a keyboard with a full number pad for $5 more.) And if you want to set your whole workspace aglow, the Apex goes well with the SteelSeries Rival 5 gaming mouse and QcK Prism extra-large light-up mousepad. $45; steelseries.com</p><p>Google Pixel 6</p><p>Google's Pixel Android phones are fantastic—especially for those all-in on Google services. The latest, the Pixel 6, has a new camera sensor that captures 150% more light and renders darker skin tones more accurately, as well as a new Google-designed Tensor chip that can transcribe your voice into text faster than we've ever seen on a phone. While the Pixel 6 Pro includes a third camera to deliver impressive 4X optical zoom, the basic Pixel 6, with just two cameras, has an unbeatable price. $599 and up; google.com</p><p>Ring Alarm Pro Security System</p><p>We're finally getting to a point where do-it-yourself home-security systems present a real challenge to the established security firms. This new security base station from Amazon-owned Ring doubles as your router, with Eero Wi-Fi 6 built in. It also has a cellular connection and an optional battery backup that can keep you up and running for hours during power and service outages. And it's easy to add and control cameras, door sensors, panic buttons—even flood and freeze sensors—with a few taps of the app. $250 and up; ring.com</p><p>GameBud Talking Tom Animatronic Toy</p><p>Talking Tom is a sassy cat with a huge following among kids under 10, who mainly know him from games, videos and related merch. In this incarnation, he's a cartoon-eyed, jaw-flapping robot, a home version of a Chuck-E-Cheese animatronic but internet connected, so he has nearly limitless things to say. Parents, we'll warn you now, this might backfire in the future when he still won't shut up, but if you just want to win at the gift game, this is a good card to play. $100; gamebud.com</p><p>iRobot Roomba j7+ Self-Emptying Vacuum</p><p>The Roomba j7+ is one step closer to being a truly hands-off vacuum, capable of avoiding common obstacles and emptying itself in its base station's waste bin for weeks at a time. Its maker, iRobot, says you only have to change the base's dust bag six times a year. During test runs, the vacuum intuitively swerved around shoestrings, cords, headphones and other wires left on the floor. The built-in camera and machine-learning software are supposed to help it steer clear of solid pet waste, too. $850; irobot.com </p><p>PHOTO: Photo illustration by WSJ; Images: Netflix, Apple, Amazon</p><p>Gift Cards and Subscriptions</p><p>Coming soon: \"How the Grinch Stole Chip-mas,\" how a little green guy shoved the global supply of semiconductors into his enormous bag, leading to gadget delays and higher prices. But don't cry in your eggnog. Hardware is only part of the tech story—software and services powered by never-ending subscriptions rule our lives. Services including Netflix and Spotify offer simple gift cards that can be applied to a subscription. Amazon lets you give Prime membership as a gift—choose from three months or a full year.</p><p>Apple has gift cards that can be applied to everything from iCloud storage to Fitness+.</p><p>Tempo Move Home Fitness System</p><p>Many people lack the space or budget for high-tech home gym equipment. Enter the Tempo Move, an affordable pared-down workout system tucked inside an inconspicuous end table. It holds 50 pounds of weight plates, and has a smartphone dock so you can stream Tempo's mobile app on your TV while your iPhone tracks your body movements for feedback on your form. The solid, diverse lineup of fitness classes includes yoga, high-intensity interval training, strength and cardio sessions for people at varying skill levels. $495 plus $39 a month; tempo.fit</p><p>Gita Mini by Piaggio Fast Forward</p><p>Piaggio Fast Forward's Gita Mini is the startup's second cargo-carrying robot, with a lower price and improved ability to follow owners on crowded streets, using machine vision. The two-wheel, 28-pound basket can haul up to 20 pounds of cargo and runs for seven hours on a charge. It can't go everywhere—especially stairs. Still, it's a fun gadget for trips to the farmers market—especially if you like being the center of attention. $1,850; piaggiofastforward.com</p><p>Apple iPad Mini</p><p>Apple finally gave its portable tablet a much-needed makeover, with a no-home-button, all-screen design that's in-and-of-itself worthy of the upgrade. The fingerprint sensor has moved to the power button to make room for a larger 8.3-inch screen, and it comes with the A15 Bionic chip—even better than the processor in the latest iPad Air. With those features also comes a price bump, but no more storage capacity than its predecessor: The baseline starts with a paltry 64 GB. $499 and up; apple.com</p><p>Mophie Snap+ Juice Pack Mini Portable Charger</p><p>For those with iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models, MagSafe accessories snap on and off, making wireless charging easier. Apple has its own MagSafe battery pack, but this version from Zagg-owned Mophie rings in with about half the price and twice the capacity. Plus, it comes with an adapter to add magnetic compatibility to other smartphones with Qi wireless charging. Unfortunately, it isn't an ideal fit for the iPhone 13 Pro because of the phone's larger camera bump—for those phones, go with Belkin's $40 MagSafe Power Bank instead. $50; bestbuy.com</p><p>Nest Hub Smart Display</p><p>Google's Nest Hub is a sunrise alarm, Google Photos frame and YouTube viewer all in one. Its best feature is what it doesn't have—a camera, which means it feels less like a privacy risk than other smart displays. We use it to turn lights off before bed and get a quick view of our calendar before starting the day. The Sleep Sensing feature uses radar to track sleep and potential disturbances, such as snoring. Just remember, for some people, too much sleep data can keep you up at night. $100; google.com</p><p>Whoop Body Smart Apparel</p><p>Whoop is a screenless fitness tracker popular with serious athletes—the kind of folks willing to pay an $18-a-month subscription fee for personalized coaching, with training for performance and injury prevention. The new Whoop 4.0 can be worn on the wrist, or embedded in a variety of apparel, from an incredibly comfortable adjustable bra to a pair of lined running shorts. The sensor can detect where it is on the body and track data accordingly. It's wearable tech you'd actually wear. $54 and up; whoop.com</p><p>Beats Fit Pro Noise-Canceling Earbuds</p><p>The AirPods Pro are among our favorite earbuds. This Beats pair has the same active noise-canceling, transparency tech for hearing external sound, and an H1 chip for fast-pairing with Apple devices. But its battery life is longer (6 hours) and its wingtip design more secure. It's also better for Android users: The Android Beats app lets you set up one-touch pairing and custom controls. $200; beatsbydre.com</p><p>Apple iPhone 13—All Four of Them</p><p>\"Happy holidays! Here's the wrong iPhone 13.\" Choosing between all four of the new models is tough. Don't yearn for a phone the size of a spruce tree? Go Mini. Want the same phone but with a bigger screen and bigger battery? iPhone 13. A smoother-scrolling display and a third rear camera for telephoto shots? The iPhone 13 Pro is our sweet spot. However, if you go up to the 13 Pro Max, you'll get a day-and-a-half of battery life and one ginormous screen—and a price higher than the MacBook Air's. $699 and up; apple.com</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What tech gifts do you recommend for others to buy this year? What have you had trouble finding? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Nest Cam</p><p>The new indoor and outdoor Nest Cam 1080p security camera saves the most recent three hours of video event recording free; full camera history storage requires a $60 annual subscription. It's battery-powered—rated for about three months, with typical activity—and you can opt for a wired connection. The camera's best feature is internal smarts: It can detect people, animals or moving vehicles without sending video to the cloud. $180; google.com</p><p>Form Smart Swim Goggles</p><p>This isn't the first time we mentioned these augmented-reality swim goggles in a gift guide, but they've been updated with a compelling feature: open-water and swim-spa metrics. For pool swimmers, there are new guided workouts that display in-goggle instructions for sets and drills. The app also has video tutorials to improve your stroke. $239, plus $15 a month after the first year; formswim.com</p><p>For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.</p><p>Write to Nicole Nguyen at nicole.nguyen@wsj.com, Joanna Stern at joanna.stern@wsj.com, Dalvin Brown at dalvin.brown@wsj.com and Wilson Rothman at Wilson.Rothman@wsj.com</p><p>Best Tech Gifts 2021: Our Favorite Gadgets</p>",
