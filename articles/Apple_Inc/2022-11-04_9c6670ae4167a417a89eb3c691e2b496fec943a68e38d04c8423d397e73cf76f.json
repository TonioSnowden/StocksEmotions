  "title": "Exxon Considers Leasing, Selling Unused Office Space at Houston Campus; Major oil company uses less than half of available space at campus poised to become global headquarters next year, memo says",
  "text": "<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. is considering leasing or selling unused office space at the sprawling Houston-area campus set to become its global headquarters next year, part of its ongoing effort to cut billions in structural costs.</p><p>In recent months, the U.S. oil giant has found that on a typical day it uses less than 50% of the available space at its 385-acre campus, which is large enough to house more than 10,000 workers, according to an internal memo viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Exxon spokesman Casey Norton confirmed the company is considering options for unused space.</p><p>Exxon's campus, located in an area of Harris County known as Spring, has never reached the full capacity it was designed for, and in recent years the company has shed thousands of workers. The company's global head count has fallen by more than 10,000 people since the pandemic began in 2020, regulatory filings show. During a historic oil-market crash that year, the company said it would shed 15% of its total workforce, including about 1,900 U.S. jobs, primarily in the Houston area.</p><p>Many of Exxon's teams are scattered across its Spring campus, according to the memo. It is now exploring ways employees can work in closer proximity, potentially in spaces it calls \"collaboration neighborhoods.\" It has also hired a broker to gauge outside interest in its unused space, the memo said.</p><p>Mr. Norton said reconfiguring the campus would allow the company to evaluate commercial opportunities for unused space, which it might choose to lease or sell. Mr. Norton noted that Exxon hasn't yet made any decisions on the matter and that it is gathering feedback as employees tour demonstration areas.</p><p>\"We want to do this right and will work with department leaders before we make any decisions on the path forward,\" Mr. Norton said.</p><p>Many other large U.S. companies have downsized their main offices this year, reducing their real estate as more workers station themselves at home for part of the workweek, while some employees have moved across state lines to capture cheaper housing and costs of living, as well as lower taxes offered by some states.</p><p>Houston's so-called energy corridor—a chain of oil-and-gas offices stretching along a highway in western Houston—has a higher proportion of its overall office space up for grabs than any other area of the city. Many oil companies have sought to downsize as employees partially work from home and as companies adjust to leaner workforces following steep job cuts in recent years, brokers said.</p><p>Exxon's downsizing isn't related to a hybrid work arrangement. The company doesn't have a policy allowing regular work from home, but employees are allowed to work remotely in certain circumstances, such as when a child is ill, said people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Built during former Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson's tenure, the Spring campus was meant to emulate other premier corporate campuses with large green spaces and other amenities. It features a cube-shaped building that appears suspended above two others, meant to symbolize the company's engineering abilities.</p><p>The concept Exxon is testing in Houston involves assigning teams of employees to neighborhoods, rather than to specific desks or offices, which the company said would allow people to pick between different types of work settings, including private or open spaces and spots designed for interaction.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What, if anything, does Exxon's downsizing say about the future of the company? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Exxon has also considered closing the equivalent of up to five of its 14 office buildings on the campus if employees' work arrangements are reconfigured, according to people familiar with an internal presentation. Exxon previously closed two Houston-area buildings outside the campus, and in January said it would move its headquarters and staff from Irving, Texas, to the Spring campus.</p><p>Commercial real-estate brokers said it is currently difficult to sublease office space in Houston. All told, the region has about 8.9 million square feet of office space available for lease, up by almost one-third from last year, while sublease transaction volume is 45% below the five-year quarterly average, according to the commercial-property firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.</p><p>\"There's a general lack of liquidity in the debt market right now for transactions in Houston,\" said Elizabeth Malone, managing director at the real-estate investment bank Eastdil Secured LLC in Dallas.</p><p>Oil companies, their service providers and equipment suppliers collectively cut tens of thousands of jobs following the onset of the pandemic and have been slow to rehire even as energy prices have recovered. In the U.S., oil companies have shifted their business strategies from focusing on pumping as much oil and gas as they can to sending most of their incoming cash to shareholders and paying off debt, which has reduced their need for labor.</p><p>Exxon last week reported a nearly $20 billion profit for the third quarter, its most-lucrative period ever and a second consecutive record for quarterly earnings that nearly tied with that of the tech giant Apple Inc.</p><p>In September, Exxon's closest rival, Chevron Corp., sold its 92-acre Chevron Park campus in San Ramon, Calif.—its global headquarters for about two decades—and planned to move into a nearby leased space about one-third of the size. Chevron said 200 employees elected to move to Houston after the company had offered to cover relocation costs this summer.</p><p>Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Exxon Considers Leasing, Selling Unused Office Space at Houston Campus</p>",
