  "text": "<p>That's no small power in a story filled with posturing and role playing—what else are the pumped-up celebrations of Mondays and related cheerleading exercises on the part of obedient employees we meet everywhere in this series?</p><p>WeCrashed</p><p>Begins Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>Adam, who describes himself as a serial entrepreneur, had at the beginning of his career tried his hand at selling pads to protect the tender knees of babies—and there was also the shoe whose stiletto heel could be folded up for comfort, which found no takers either. He has, nonetheless, one asset recognizable to anyone he talks to: namely, a bottomless reserve of pride and a belief in the possibilities for good, for improvement, that he can bring to the world. When seeking investors—he lectures to college students among other audiences—he hears a jibe about the possibility of investing in his confidence. And this is the state of his life and career when he first meets Rebekah, who is—not surprisingly—unimpressed by him and not disposed to conceal the fact.</p><p>Merciless in her appraisal—this is the first hint of the compelling character Ms. Hathaway is about to deliver—she informs him that everything he tells her is a lie. He next shows up at a supermarket in her neighborhood, far from where he lives, pretending to be food shopping. She points out, with no little scorn, that he's doing his shopping 70 blocks away from his home. It doesn't help that his food purchase is a single banana. None of this will stand in the way of Adam's effort to win Rebekah.</p><p>Nor should it be thought that the writers of this sharp script entirely overlook the delusions cherished by these two central characters.</p><p>Altogether a compelling tale whose drama grows ever greater, not least in the final chapters packed with tension.</p><p>'WeCrashed' Review: Why WeWork Didn't Work Out</p>",
