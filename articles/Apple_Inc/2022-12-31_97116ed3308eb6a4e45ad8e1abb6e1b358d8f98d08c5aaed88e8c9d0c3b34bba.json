  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Finance & Markets: Saudi Fund Takes Bigger Stake in Magic Leap",
  "text": "<p>Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is focusing on building its metaverse, an online realm that can be accessed through Oculus VR headsets that the company provides. Microsoft Corp. sells the Holo-Lens headset to business clients and the U.S. military. Snap Inc., parent of the social-media app Snapchat, also has a goggle offering and Apple Inc. has been expected to unveil its own augmented-reality device.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, also known as PIF, has been a longtime investor in Magic Leap. In September 2021, its stake surpassed more than 50%, according to a regulatory filing made public in the U.K. earlier in December. The filing says the investor, since November, has secured the right to appoint four of the eight board members.</p><p>Florida-based Magic Leap, which at one point had a valuation of nearly $7 billion, said it can't comment on individual investors and declined to say whether the Saudi fund has added any members to the board. PIF didn't respond to a request to comment. The Daily Telegraph previously reported on PIF's controlling stake in the company.</p><p>Magic Leap had previously raised nearly $3.5 billion from investors including Alphabet Inc. venture-capital arm GV, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc.'s investment arm.</p><p>Some advocates of the technology have said it could alter how people and businesses interact, not unlike the changes brought on by the smartphone revolution. The metaverse -- online worlds where users can play and hang out with friends as avatars -- has been touted as the future of the internet, experienced largely through digital goggles and headsets.</p>",
