  "text": "<p>Apple supplier Foxconn reported a 13.5-fold jump in net profit for the first quarter of 2021 compared with the same period last year, when the company's China-based factories were heavily hit by the first pandemic lockdown.</p> <p>Net earnings at the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer were NT$28.2bn (US$1bn), up from just NT$2.1bn a year earlier, outperforming investors' expectations. Revenue increased 45 per cent to NT$1.4tn.</p> <p>The strong results come as the leading iPhone producer is pushing into new business segments, most importantly the manufacturing of electric vehicles.</p> <p>Earlier on Friday, Foxconn said it had agreed that the first factory to churn out electric cars from late 2023 under a joint venture with US company Fisker would be built in the US. Foxconn's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2920cf0b-9a7c-40ed-a2cc-50b8d13d3bb2\">manufacturing site in Wisconsin</a>, which the Taiwanese company has struggled to put to use after an initial plan to produce LCD panels fell apart, is one of four US locations under consideration, according to Fisker. </p> <p>Foxconn chair Young Liu said the first consideration in picking the US location was the presence of suppliers nearby, while the second was what government incentives the companies could secure. Foxconn said the other main production location was likely to be in China, where most of its manufacturing base is located.</p> <p>Foxconn said it expected another double-digit rise in revenues in the current quarter, but was more cautious in its profit outlook.</p> <p>The company has said before that it aimed to raise its gross margin, which stood at 5.8 per cent in the first quarter, to 7 per cent for the full year and 10 per cent in the longer term.</p> <p>But Liu indicated on Friday that the company might struggle to meet its 2021 gross margin target. “It remains our target, but we are currently more focused on increasing earnings per share than we are focused on the gross margin,” he said on a call with investors.</p> <p>Liu added that this was because <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1fcca5f-5937-4711-ac95-d690ce536e2d\">wide-ranging shortages</a> in upstream components and materials disproportionately hit products that are more varied but are made at smaller scale. Such products, often components Foxconn makes in-house, typically command a higher profit margin than the mass-scale assembly work for products such as the iPhone.</p> <p>Liu said that in its pursuit of electric vehicle business, Foxconn would invest in joint ventures such as the one with Fisker for the lower-margin assembly work but aim to focus on the production of higher-margin components and sub-components itself. </p> <p>The company is highly vertically integrated and makes a broad range of components from LCD screens to computer casings and semiconductors.</p><p>Source: Kathrin Hille in Taipei 2021 'Foxconn bounces back from pandemic disruption as profit soars' FT.com 14 May.
