  "text": "<p>   The Winter Olympics get underway in Beijing Friday, and somehow the thrill of victory is gone. The pandemic and China's \"zero-Covid\" policy is part of the problem, as even local spectators are banned. But the bigger issue is the way the host country has changed since Beijing hosted the Summer Games in 2008. </p><p>   Those Olympics were a coming out party for a newly rich China. Most world leaders showed up, including U.S. President George W. Bush. The world still hoped that China was evolving into a more politically open government that would play by international rules. Current President Xi Jinping had yet to take control. </p><p>   This year the attraction of Chinese wealth and power are gone. The striking message of the games so far is that the FBI has advised Americans to leave their iPhones and computers at home and carry burner phones instead. The burners will be harder for China's extensive system of surveillance to track and listen in on unacceptable thoughts. </p><p>   A member of China's Olympic organizing committee has warned visiting athletes that they could be punished if they offer any political gesture or criticism. The Games that were conceived to forge international understanding have become an exercise in enforcing China's authoritarian values. </p><p>   One question is how NBC will handle all this in its broadcasts to U.S. audiences. The company paid some $12 billion for the exclusive TV and digital rights to the Olympics through 2032. Feel-good stories about American athletes are always the heart of its coverage. </p><p>   But will the network also become a vehicle for conveying Chinese propaganda about its happy, pollution-free, superior government and society? Will the network ignore the Uyghur concentration camps, the arrest of dissenters and their lawyers, the crushing of Hong Kong and the threats of war against Taiwan? </p><p>   \"We stand for press access and freedom globally, and we resist efforts to influence our coverage or impede our access,\" NBCUniversal told us in a statement. But there's reason to wonder after MSNBC senior producer Kyle Griffin tweeted recently about \"China's alleged human rights abuses.\" Alleged? </p><p>   We wish the athletes the best. But no one should ignore the Communist Party's crushing political and economic control that stands behind the airbrushed TV images of these Games. </p><p></p>",
