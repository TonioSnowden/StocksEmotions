  "text": "<p>The mood is changing, though. Pegasus is not only a threat to foreigners, reports Calcalist, a local newspaper. The Israeli police have also used the software, without a court order, to spy on local activists, politicians and businessmen, the paper claims. Its allegations have not been corroborated. But they were enough to convince the government to investigate. Naftali Bennett, the prime minister, said the deputy attorney-general was looking into the matter. The public-security minister, Omer Barlev, who oversees the police, called for a commission of inquiry.</p><p>The list of people allegedly targeted by the police has ignited a firestorm of indignation among supporters of Binyamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister (pictured). It includes his aides and one of his sons. It also includes a crucial state witness in the corruption trial of Mr Netanyahu, who pounced on the allegations. He called it a \"dark day for Israeli democracy\" and said the alleged use of Pegasus by the police was like the army \"using planes meant to be used against Iran, Hizbullah and Hamas to blow up Israeli civilians\".</p><p>Much is still unclear--like who might have chosen the targets of Pegasus and why. Nevertheless, Mr Netanyahu's allies have called for his trial to be dismissed. For now, it has been suspended so that the prosecution can figure out whether Pegasus was used in the gathering of evidence. A commission of inquiry may, eventually, provide some answers. But it also carries risks for Mr Netanyahu, who leads the opposition in the Knesset (Israel's parliament). His critics were quick to note that the alleged abuses by the police are said to have occurred on his watch.</p><p>As prime minister, Mr Netanyahu served as NSO Group's chief salesman, offering Pegasus to foreign leaders as a carrot for better relations. The firm's customer list includes the populist leaders of Brazil, Hungary and India, with whom Mr Netanyahu got along, as well as the Sunni Arab regimes--Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates--that established relations with Israel during his tenure.</p><p>Mr Netanyahu had also urged the Israeli police to do more with the tools at its disposal. In 2015 he chose Roni Alsheikh to lead the force. Mr Alsheikh was an unusual pick, having never served in the police. But he had been the deputy chief of Shin Bet, the internal security agency, which uses cyber-technology in its counter-terrorism operations. At his induction ceremony, Mr Netanyahu urged him to use it \"also for policing, also for the daily protection of civilians and for law enforcement\". Still, there is no public evidence that Mr Netanyahu was aware that the police were using Pegasus. Mr Alsheikh says the reports are \"disconnected from reality\".</p><p>It will be interesting to see how Mr Bennett's government navigates the scandal, given its ties to the cyber-industry. His interior minister, Ayelet Shaked, is a former tech executive with friends at NSO Group. The prime minister himself made millions co-founding an online-banking security company. As defence minister (under Mr Netanyahu) he proposed giving NSO Group data about Israelis as part of an effort to contain covid-19. That led to a backlash from other lawmakers.</p><p>The government may be growing weary of all the controversy surrounding NSO Group. Late last year America blacklisted the company. Weeks later Apple sued it for \"weaponising powerful state-sponsored spyware\" against its customers. Now Israelis are complaining, too. Perhaps it is time to rein in Pegasus.</p>",
