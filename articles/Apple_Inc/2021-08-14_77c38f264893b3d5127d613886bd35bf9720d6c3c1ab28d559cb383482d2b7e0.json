  "text": "<p>\n  For the better part of a decade, I have been on a quest to find the perfect beach chair. Wooed by slick Instagram ads promising a better, more life-altering seat, I buy a newer, fancier model annually. Then right about this time of summer, I realize its shortcomings. </p><p>\n  My efforts aren't lost on my regular beach-sitting crew. As we gather each July at Wiborg Beach in East Hampton, N.Y., they watch with amusement as I unveil my latest. Sometimes it is tricked out and, often, complicated to use. This year, I blew the bank and went big, arriving on the sand with a $198 Sunflow. As I muddled through the five-step process of opening it, I assured my friends (as I have with other chairs in the past) that it was, in fact, \"the Cadillac of beach chairs.\" Every year, on cue, my friend Martha somewhat smugly says that her small, no-name chair is old (14 this year), that it is \"perfect\" and that she OxiCleans it at the end of each season to keep it looking new. It doesn't do much: It opens. And it closes. These two factors should not be taken for granted. I once had to stuff a new seat into the back of my car fully ajar after I couldn't get it to fold down. (Another not only tipped over while I sat in it but was so difficult to open I felt certain hundreds of comfortably seated sunbathers were mocking me as I tried to set it up.) </p><p>\n  To save you the shame, struggle and expense of buying the wrong beach chair yourself, I decided to conduct a slightly more scientific review of my fleet, as well as some new additions. I built my test list off the suggestions I gathered by asking fellow beachgoers about their own chairs. Most people, I learned, have strong opinions. I made sure to hit various price points and include a range of standout features, from ultra-strong frames to customizable cushions. I also weeded out a few camping and lawn chairs not made primarily for sand. Then I enlisted the help of friends and strangers to test the comfort, style and ease of use each offered. Here, my favorite six. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  1. The Bargain Buy </p><p>\n  The petite, no-nonsense Rio Wave opens to just one position and boasts not so much as a cupholder. But what this seat lacks in features it makes up for in value and consistency. At under $40, it's less than half the price of the next-most-expensive model we recommend, and it employs a ripstop fabric and steel frame to withstand sand and surf. </p><p>\n  User Friendliness: Beyond price, this chair's best attribute is its weight: 5 pounds. You can carry two on one arm and your cooler in the other. It's so low and close to the sand, however, that getting out of it requires agility. </p><p>\n  Bells and Whistles: None. $38, amazon.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2. The Looker </p><p>\n  If you believe that your beach chair should be an extension of your personal style, the Sunday Supply Co. might appeal to you. The removable cushion comes in a variety of fun, beachy fabrics -- from fresh florals to abstract stripes -- that also match the brand's umbrellas. </p><p>\n  User Friendliness: This chair is similarly lightweight and as low to the sand as the Rio. But by the end of the day, the cushion had slid down and crumpled. </p><p>\n  Bells and Whistles: A storage pocket holds your beach read. The removable carrying strap is convenient, but it wasn't immediately clear how to attach it. $149, us.sundaysupply.co </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  3. The Pop Star </p><p>\n  You'd be right to think you've seen the Wavy Marlin Deluxe Backpack Beach Chair by Tommy Bahama everywhere: With 25 million sold since 2009, this chair dominates the scene at the shore. </p><p>\n  User Friendliness: Offering five positions, including full recline, the chair holds up to a full day on the sand. Once you learn to collapse it (stepping on the back leg is efficient) it's also very portable and functional. </p><p>\n  Bells and Whistles: Wooden armrests look great but didn't feel as comfortable as plastic or padded ones on other chairs. The cooler bag is handy for drinks, but its zippers eventually stick. $80, tommybahama.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  4. The Stalwart </p><p>\n  Popular cooler brand Yeti branched out with their Hondo Base Camp. The seat uses an extra-durable frame the company says holds up to 500 pounds and was inspired by mountain-bike construction. With a design that looks a bit like an office chair, however, it reads more function than fashion, and is also ultra expensive at $300 clams. </p><p>\n  User Friendliness: The Hondo is the perfect height -- not too high, not too low. The mesh fabric has a bit of give that lets you sink in, but not too far. But at 16.5 pounds, it's on the heavy side. </p><p>\n  Bells and Whistles: The seat comes with a sturdy, well-placed cupholder. $300, yeti.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  5. The Supporter </p><p>\n  The Strongback Low Gravity 3.0 Beach Chair's claim to fame is its ergonomic seat with a lumbar cushion. Though portable and compact, the chair suffers from some unbeachy details: a shiny fabric back and sturdy black steel frame. </p><p>\n  User Friendliness: Lumbar support makes this chair superb for a full day of sitting, but after a few uses on sand it needs some WD-40 in the joints. </p><p>\n  Bells and Whistles: Folds into an easy-to-carry-bag that doesn't take up a ton of space in the car. But the cup holder sits perilously close to the ground, putting a drink at risk of taking on sand. $100, strongbackchair.com </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  6. The Status-Maker </p><p>\n  New in 2020, the prestigiously chic Sunflow Chair crosses 1960s Italian design with the Apple aesthetic. Be prepared for strangers to approach and comment. </p><p>\n  User Friendliness: Thanks to its depth, width and supportive seat, this is a full-bottle-of-rose, sit-all-day kind of chair. Opening it, however, requires practice, a page of instructions and a video. It's a beach chair that comes with a helpline. Plus, at 9.4 pounds, it's heavy to carry. </p><p>\n  Bells and Whistles: Attachments are available from $25. The cupholder, though, is hard to lock in place, and the shade top feels flimsy. From $198, getsunflow.com </p><p></p>",
