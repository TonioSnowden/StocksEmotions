  "title": "REVIEW --- A Photo Hater's Guide to Getting a Photo Taken",
  "text": "<p>The reason I'm telling you all this is that I've written a new book of humor essays, arriving Nov. 1 -- thank you all for buying 40 copies, plus an extra three for the dog, the cat and the goldfish. The book is done, that's that, title chosen, no more changes, what's there is there, except for one thing: I needed to take an author photo.</p><p>There was no getting out of this photo. I am not a cool, secretive writer, like Thomas Pynchon, who gets to blow it off and remain a mystery. My editor wanted something, and he wanted it by Aug. 1. I told him I was working on it, when all I was really doing was praying that by Aug. 1, the entire publishing industry would collapse, my book and all future books would be canceled, and I would not have to take an author photo.</p><p>I knew what I didn't want. I knew I didn't want to look too serious, because I am not a serious person. I was terrified of coming off as pretentious. I didn't want to look like someone who would tell a three-hour story about a Vermont book festival. I did not want one of those author photos where it looks like the author is smoking a pipe, even if they are not smoking a pipe. I did not want to wear a tie, or an ascot, a tall hat, or a parrot. Actually I would have been OK with a parrot -- but where was I going to get a parrot at this hour?</p><p>I did not want to do weird gestures with my hands. Author photos can get weird with the hands. I did not want to place my head in my palm or lay my chin on a fist, like Rodin's thinker, because, as readers of this column know, I barely think at all. I seriously thought about sending my editor an old photograph of Tom Brady, or Steve McQueen, or Gonzo from the Muppets, and seeing if anyone noticed.</p><p>When Aug. 1 arrived, and the publishing industry did not collapse, I went to my sister-in-law's house, because she is an art teacher and the only person I know who does not regularly take photographs with a thumb in the corner. I did not come with a wardrobe or any fancy technology. It was just me, an iPhone and her backyard. At first I smiled; she advised me not to. A smile makes you look like an ad for the orthodontist. A humor writer is supposed to look like they're up to something -- like they may or may not have planted a whoopee cushion, or stolen a watch.</p><p>After a few minutes, we got it done. There's no thumb in the corner. I'm not saying it's the greatest author's photo ever taken, but I feel confident that I don't look like a broken ventriloquist's dummy. When I showed it to my wife, she said I looked cute, which felt like the greatest compliment in the world. You all are going to have to wait a couple of months to judge the results, but I hope you like it, too. And I'm going to print a few copies for my mother, because she and her camera deserved much, much better.</p>",
