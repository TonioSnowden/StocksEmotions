  "text": "<p>Random House, 1,046 pages, $45</p><p>Back in 2018, the indefatigable ex-Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau paid a visit to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt's onetime home on East 65th Street -- now Hunter College's Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute, where I work. \"The Boss,\" as generations of aides called him, had come for the naming of the building's stairway in his honor. Frail, stooped, inching along with the help of a walker, he barely made it to the rostrum. He was 99 years old.</p><p>Handed the microphone, Morgenthau (1919-2019) held forth for 15 spellbinding minutes, recalling the times he had accompanied his father, FDR's confidant Henry Morgenthau Jr., to the house in Manhattan, and how he'd later barbecued hot dogs for the Roosevelts and the king and queen of England at Hyde Park. The stories were lucid and detailed, the words slightly slurred but strong. He even raised his arms to display the silver cuff links -- monogrammed \"FDR\" and \"HM\" -- that Roosevelt had given the elder Morgenthau.</p><p>That day, it was possible for a witness to channel nearly a century of New York, and national, history: not only the DA's long reign as a federal and county prosecutor, but his father's service as the cabinet officer who labored tirelessly but with limited success to save his fellow Jews in Europe from Hitler.</p><p>With the appearance of Andrew Meier's voluminous and consistently hypnotic multigenerational biography \"Morgenthau,\" it is now possible to delve even deeper into this only-in-America dynasty: its origins in Germany; its fall from, and later return to, wealth and influence; its scions' unshakable commitment to public service. As a bonus, the book offers the best glimpse since Stephen Birmingham's \"Our Crowd\" into the gilded society of German-American Jews who forged an alternate \"Four Hundred\" in New York, amassing wealth and achieving influence through the philanthropic infiltration of New York's WASP-dominated cultural institutions. A former Time magazine correspondent and Russia specialist, Mr. Meier draws the reader into the family's private and professional lives with verve, a marvelous ear for anecdote and a gift for cherry-picking from his prodigious research.</p><p>Among rich families like the Lehmans and Schiffs, the Morgenthaus were financially second-tier, yet doggedly committed to excellence, advancement -- and advantageous marriages. Most Morgenthaus were neither colorful nor dynamic, but they proved uniformly relentless. The family saga begins in Germany, with Lazarus Morgenthau, a dapper cigar manufacturer who had lost his luck, money and status. Emigrating to America just a year after the Civil War, Lazarus pursued ill-fated get-rich-quick schemes like homeopathic elixirs, culminating in the production of an ornate \"Golden Book of Life,\" a sort of glamorous morocco-bound ledger for keeping records of charitable donations, intended to resonate with the Jewish belief that on the day of atonement God inscribes the names of the worthy in the heavenly \"Book of Life.\"</p><p>Toward the end of his own life, Lazarus became so unstable that his worried and mortified children separated him from their mother and eventually institutionalized him. Hounded by creditors, the old charlatan died penniless, senile and essentially alone.</p><p>Subsequent generations of Morgenthau men strove to be the opposite of their flamboyant paterfamilias. Son Henry became a diligent if unostentatious student, enrolling at CCNY at the age of 14, so relentlessly systematic that he drew up a list of 406 prospective brides.</p><p>A proficient if disengaged lawyer, he transformed himself into a fabulously successful real-estate investor -- triumphing in a field that the bankers and manufacturers in the \"Crowd\" eschewed as beneath them. In the 1880s and '90s, Henry snatched up parcels of land in Harlem and Washington Heights, reselling at enormous profit, and made further killings by acquiring and then disposing of property adjacent to future subway stations. His financial future secured, Henry broke into, and later took over, the board of the long-restricted Metropolitan Opera -- he was not only its first Jewish trustee and chairman, but the first to sit in the Met's exclusive \"Golden Horseshoe.\"</p><p>Henry named his son Henry Jr. -- defying the custom that forbade naming Jewish children for the living -- but by then the Morgenthaus were culturally, not religiously, Jewish. Questing after assimilation and acceptance, the elder Henry took a shine to the progressive Woodrow Wilson. He raised a fortune for the Democrat's 1912 presidential campaign, hoping Wilson would make history and name him the first Jewish Treasury secretary. Instead, Morgenthau earned a consolation prize: the ambassadorship to the Sublime Porte, the Ottoman Empire. Once he arrived in Turkey, in late 1913, he took to the job with a passion. Morgenthau is remembered for working passionately to stop the Armenian genocide and protect the region's Jews.</p><p>Henry Jr. proved as indifferent a student as his father had been rigorous. Brilliant but lacking even a high-school diploma, he finally found his calling as a gentleman farmer in Dutchess County, where he succumbed to his charismatic neighbor Franklin Roosevelt's \"gravitational pull\" and became his dearest personal friend. FDR would, in time, make this Morgenthau secretary of the Treasury, to the horror of anti-Semites, including many within the government. Emboldened, Morgenthau meddled in Defense and State department business and even used T-men to crack down on criminals he thought the FBI was neglecting.</p><p>Mr. Meier takes readers through Henry's triumphant campaign for the Lend-Lease policy that aided Britain before the U.S. entered World War II, along with his failure to focus FDR's attention on Nazi persecution of Jews, and the harrowing disappointments that followed. Infamously, in June 1939 the administration decided to turn away the ship St. Louis and its hundreds of doomed Jewish refugees. In Mr. Meier's account, FDR somehow emerges untarnished from these episodes, at least as seen through Henry's sympathetic eyes. The Holocaust claims its victims while Henry remains, in his daughter's words, \"FDR's favorite Jew.\" Morgenthau's War Refugee Board, established in January 1944, did save some 200,000 Jewish lives, a triumph unless measured against the 6 million who perished. No wonder Morgenthau tried FDR's patience by advocating a \"hard peace\" that would have reduced vast regions of defeated Germany to a pastoral state forever incapable of rearming.</p><p>After Roosevelt's sudden death in 1945 -- Henry was one of the last to see him alive -- Morgenthau lost his political moorings so abruptly that he practically dared Harry Truman to fire him. Truman obliged -- telling one newspaperman that \"Morgenthau didn't know s</p><p>---</p><p> from apple butter . . . I wonder why FDR kept him around.\" Speaking of Morgenthau and Bernard Baruch, another prominent Jew, Truman commented that \"they were all alike -- they couldn't keep from meddling.\"</p><p>\"Morgenthau\" abounds with such chilling, casually rendered anti-Semitic remarks -- even from Eleanor Roosevelt, Henry's greatest defender. Eleanor also emerges as the most interesting female character in the saga -- no real surprise -- along with Henry Jr.'s long-suffering secretary, Henrietta Klotz. Otherwise, this is a book about the male Morgenthau line. Intriguing females like Henry Sr.'s granddaughter, the historian Barbara Tuchman, are mentioned only in passing.</p><p>An extraordinary postscript to the wartime Morgenthau story: Henry removed volumes of copious notes -- the \"Morgenthau Diaries\" -- from the Treasury Department and then announced a plan to turn the government-owned -- perhaps classified -- material into a memoir. The dispute about who owned them and the propriety of drawing on them ignited an uproar that eerily presaged Donald Trump's shipment of classified files to Mar-a-Lago decades later.</p><p>So much of Mr. Meier's book is devoted to Henry's son Robert that the long text almost becomes unbalanced; essentially, a major biography of \"Mr. DA\" lurks within this massive, multigenerational tome. Bob goes from Deerfield Academy to Amherst to active duty in the wartime Navy, later to Yale Law, infatuation with the Kennedys, failure as a New York gubernatorial candidate, work as a fearless U.S. attorney (dismissed by Nixon), and more than 30 years as Manhattan's crime-busting DA, at once cherished and feared.</p><p>Mr. Meier does not spare the Morgenthaus the criticism they occasionally deserve. Henry Sr. was a control freak, and the imperious Henry Jr. was rescued from perfection only by his late-in-life marriage to a jewel-hungry second wife. Bob got too chummy with a pre-presidential Donald Trump, even after Trump egged on the wrongful prosecution of the Central Park Five, convicted and imprisoned for a gang rape they did not commit. This is the one case of prosecutorial overreach Morgenthau worried would be \"written on my tombstone.\"</p><p>One would imagine that dignity, selflessness and inexhaustibility can neither endure in a family nor engage a reader for nearly 900 pages. Mr. Meier proves otherwise. And his magisterial book vividly reminds us of the days when immigrants yearned not to preserve ancestral identity but to live the American dream. As Henry Sr. proudly told a group of fellow Jewish elites: \"I am the amalgam of what's been produced by putting a little boy in that [melting] pot and mixing him with a part of yourselves.\" The same can be said of all the remarkable Morgenthaus.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Holzer is the Lincoln Prize-winning author or editor of more than 50 books.</p>",
