  "text": "<p>Scribner, 334 pages, $28</p><p>What if we could upload our consciousness to the cloud? What if strangers could access not just our pictures and videos, but our thoughts and memories? What if technology allowed us to feel and experience what others feel and experience? What if the final frontier of privacy -- the division between one consciousness and another -- were abolished entirely?</p><p>This is the breathless premise of Jennifer Egan's internet novel \"The Candy House,\" which imagines a not-too-distant future in which our hyperconnected world of social-media sharing is extended to new, nauseating extremes. It opens in 2010 with Bix Bouton, the mega-famous founder of a social-media company called Mandala. Bix is anxiously roaming the streets of Manhattan, worried that he will never change the world again. Casting about for a new revolutionary idea, he wanders into a gathering of academics. This is apparently Bix's research method. His first company drew on anthropological ideas that \"exploded in his mind like ink from a squid, and made him very rich.\" In his fresh plunge amongst thinkers and theorists, Bix learns about an experimental device that can \"externalize animal consciousness.\" Eureka! He monetizes it, creating Own Your Unconscious, a new technology that allows users to upload their memories, gaining complete access to the contents of their minds.</p><p>The innovation is presented as utopian. Mandala had promised individual access: \"Recover Your Memories,\" \"Know Your Knowledge.\" Now, in exchange for uploading their own memories, users can also access the memories of others. This feature is called the Collective Consciousness, and we are told that it aids greatly in solving crimes, preserving dying languages, increasing empathy and tracking down someone you shared a beer with once, among other things.</p><p>The technology also forms the basis for the novel's structure, loosely linking together its disparate stories and narrators. As in Ms. Egan's 2010 novel \"A Visit From the Goon Squad,\" which won both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize, \"The Candy House\" unfolds in the interlocking narratives of a sprawling cast of characters. There is a graduate student studying \"authenticity as problematized by digital experience\"; she takes as her subject a man who screams in public for prolonged periods to provoke authentic responses in people. Another section is narrated by an opioid addict who longs for \"the thing itself\" -- life free of digital artifice. A woman mourning her father's death explores his uploaded memories to relive a trip they took together. There are \"eluders,\" who are wary of the \"candy house\" of technology and seek to defy it by living off the grid. \"Counters\" try to track them down. One character creates a nonprofit that helps people elude via \"proxies,\" bots that \"conceal the fact that their human occupants have eluded.\"</p><p>Many of these characters first appeared peripherally in \"Goon Squad.\" (Ms. Egan bills \"The Candy House\" as a \"sibling novel,\" which seems to mean something like a sequel.) Now the characters are older, and as the novel cuts back and forth from, roughly, the 2010s to the 2030s, they and their children navigate the brave new world created by Bix's technology. But while the narratives of \"Goon Squad\" cohered around the characters' reflections on mortality and the passage of time, those of \"The Candy House\" never quite come together. Ms. Egan wants us to understand . . . what, exactly? Beneath its initial utopian promises, Own Your Unconscious would seem to herald distinctly dystopian consequences. Could there be anything more hellish than unfettered access to everyone else's unconscious? There are vague gestures in this direction: the \"eluders\" signal a disdain for the technology, which we hear described (twice) as a \"Faustian\" bargain. But the end of privacy does not bring cataclysm. There is no cautionary tale here.</p><p>Ms. Egan seems, oddly, not to have thought through the narrative potential of her own fictional creation. Forget cataclysm. Does the knowledge that they can share their memories online affect the way people behave? Do they start living performatively for the Collective Consciousness, the way people today pose performatively for Instagram or Facebook? What sorts of self-knowledge follow from the capacity to access the complete contents of your mind? Is there such a thing as too much self-knowledge? Ms. Egan's innovation does not yield innovative insights. Cool new things become possible at the cost of privacy, but we already know that technology operates this way. The novel's moral complexity amounts, in other words, to a shrug. (It is tempting to note that, in college, Ms. Egan dated Steve Jobs -- a model for her fictional tech founder Bix Bouton? \"Whether in the end he [Jobs] did us harm or good is an open question, from my point of view,\" she told the New Yorker.)</p><p>Ms. Egan tries to jazz things up by offering narrative innovation instead. In \"Goon Squad,\" she shocked readers by delivering one chapter in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. In \"The Candy House,\" we have a chapter composed entirely of tweet-like messages that recount the espionage mission of one Lulu the Spy. (In the technology-addled future, Lulu's entire body has been operationalized: \"A button is embedded behind the inside ligament of your right knee . . . A continuous depression of the button indicates an emergency.\") The messages amount to a series of choppy sentences; in other words, a story. Another chapter unfolds in the form of emails between several people, a kind of tedious version of 18th-century epistolary novels. Others are meant to be bits of the Collective Consciousness showing characters' memories, but they are indistinguishable from conventional third-person narratives.</p><p>That may, in the end, be Ms. Egan's point. Bix's son Gregory, an aspiring novelist, opposes his father's technology on the grounds that it \"posed an existential threat to fiction.\" Novels already allow us imaginative access to the minds of others. Will the Collective Consciousness render them obsolete? Ultimately Gregory realizes that it actually gives him more material for his fiction. It was \"his father's parting gift: a galaxy of human lives hurtling toward his curiosity.\" In this burst of optimism, the old technology and the new are reconciled. Fiction will save us.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Winkler is a New York-based journalist and book reviewer.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
