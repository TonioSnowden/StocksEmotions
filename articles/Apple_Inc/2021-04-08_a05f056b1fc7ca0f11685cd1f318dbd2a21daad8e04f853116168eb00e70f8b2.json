  "title": "Norway Fund Shifts to Active Management",
  "text": "<p>\"What we want to do is make sure we use risk in a slightly more productive way,\" Mr. Tangen said in an interview on Wednesday.</p><p>As the world's largest single shareholder, the fund owns on average 1.4% of the world's listed companies, making it a large investor in companies like Apple Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The fund returned 10.9% last year.</p><p>Under the updated strategy, the fund's portfolio managers will focus less on the macroeconomic environment or factors like growth, and more on assessing individual companies. Mr. Tangen signaled such moves in a December interview with The Wall Street Journal. The fund for years has been embroiled in an active versus passive tussle over how best to invest, with everyone, from outside fund managers, former Norges Bank Investment Management executives and academics, weighing in.</p><p>Established in the 1990s to invest the revenues from North Sea oil discoveries, the oil fund, as it is known, safeguards wealth for the future. It adheres to a mandate given by the Ministry of Finance to govern its holdings in more than 9,100 companies. Most are governed by an index, and the fund can't invest in most private companies.</p><p>Going forward, the oil fund will make greater use of forensic accountants to root out fraud, Mr. Tangen said.</p><p>The fund was able to minimize its losses in German payments company Wirecard AG in 2019 after it discovered irregularities and read early news coverage. Mr. Tangen said he hopes to do more of that.</p><p>The fund, which had earlier outlined plans to invest in wind and solar power, said Wednesday it had made its first investment in an unlisted renewable energy project. It signed an agreement to buy half of a Dutch offshore wind farm for 1.375 billion euros, equivalent to $1.63 billion. Such investments are still expected to comprise a small percentage of the overall portfolio, which is around 70% dedicated to stocks.</p><p>The fund's plan to increase active management also includes using environmental, social and governance criteria to exclude companies from investment, using more external fund managers and adding more portfolio managers in Oslo, where the fund's headquarters is based.</p><p>Mr. Tangen said he and his team are monitoring the effects of inflation across asset classes, but that they haven't altered the portfolio to benefit from a so-called reflation trade.</p>",
