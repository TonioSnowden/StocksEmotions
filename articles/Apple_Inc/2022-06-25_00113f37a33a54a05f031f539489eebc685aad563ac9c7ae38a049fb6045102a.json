  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Apple's New Passkeys Could  Make Estate Settling Harder",
  "text": "<p>   While Apple Inc.'s passkeys are an interesting innovation in online security, they fail to address an important problem (\"Apple Wants to End Passwords -- Here's How It Would Work\" Personal Journal, June 13). </p><p>   When my brother died, we were unable to access his bank accounts, life insurance or health records because his passwords were secured by a password manager to which he had left no one the master password. I've subsequently adopted a password manager and given my sister access to the safe-deposit box where my master password is stored. How will biometric-based passkeys allow for access after death? Managing someone's estate is already complicated, and this could complicate that task. </p><p>   Stephen Klein </p><p>   Spinnerstown, Pa. </p><p></p>",
