  "text": "<p>I am already practising the Charleston. Economists, some of my <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f3fd905-92a4-4361-ba4d-11bf222b2c33\">colleagues included</a>, wonder if the post-pandemic world will roar as it did in the 1920s. The case seems logical enough even to we in the innumerate laity. Take a year's worth of unspent earnings, top it up with fiscal largesse, throw in the stymied urge to party, and you have a boom for the ages. Unless a country does something fanciful, like withdraw from a mega-market in its own continent, it is hard to think what a counteracting drag on growth might be.</p> <p>Another Jazz Age would be nice before I ease into my Burgundy-hoarding middle years. But the period was so called for a reason: the 1920s were as much a cultural Arcadia as a material one. People responded to the Great War and the Spanish flu by spending, yes, but also by shredding all convention in the arts. Painting continued its prewar drift away from singularity of perspective. Novels became plotless explorations of the inner life. Music was complicated by atonal experimentation as much as by jazz itself. In the built environment, Art Deco and the International Style displaced 19th-century fussiness with clean lines and chrome. Scribbling as a prisoner of war, Wittgenstein transformed — he would say destroyed — philosophy. To paraphrase Harry Lime in <em>The Third Man</em>, trauma had its creative uses.</p> <p>The tantalising mystery is whether it will again. We have lived through nothing to equal the systematic gunning-down of 19-year-old conscripts in French meadows. But taken together, the 2008 crash, the pandemic and the populism that reached its foul apotheosis in Washington this week add up to an era of concentrated distress. The waning of a superpower against a rampant new one (another echo of the interwar years) is yet a fourth dislocation. It would be strange if this period did not provoke artists into something new. A Year Zero, a point of departure, might be in the offing.</p> <p>It is due. The need for some kind of rupture will not be evident to all. But the early 21st century deserves to go down as a long cultural recession. This was when Hollywood ran out of plot ideas until it cannibalised old franchises. Episodic television drama, the central art form of the age, is conservatism incarnate. The linear narratives, the costumed worship of the past, above all the alleviation of all burdens on the audience to do any work: these shows are too often soap operas with better lighting. As for literature, the artist who has best reconciled depth with sales, Hilary Mantel, immerses us in a world that is half a millennium old.</p> <p>Peter Thiel had science and technology in mind when he warned of declining innovation. Even before the recent vaccines gainsaid him, though, his point applied much more fittingly to the arts. If anything profound is to come from the pandemic and the other upheavals of the day, I hope it is a jolt out of this generation-long imaginative rut. Or at least an awareness that we have been in one. Some of the social conditions are there for an epiphany. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f81c7574-a794-4be9-8953-6da6ca32216d\">The 1920s were possible</a> because all authority — political, aesthetic — stood discredited after civilisation's near-fall. The world is mercifully not working with quite such a naked canvas now. Enough is in flux, though, enough is tainted, to allow for experiment.</p> <p>Not all of it will be good, or even pleasant. But then it wasn't last time. Even by century-old standards, Virginia Woolf was a crashing snob. Ezra Pound was a logorrhoeic&#xa0;anti-Semite. Openness to new ideas led to eugenics being given the time of day. Just as the economics of the 1920s are misremembered (much of Europe did not roar), so too is the culture. Kevin Jackson's book on 1922, <em>Constellation of Genius</em>, is eye-opening but too generously named.</p> <p>Still, there is a parallel universe where those years of giddy novelty never happened. You wouldn't want to live there. It is the economists who are channelling the 1920s right now. It should be the artists. Just our luck if we get all the bling of that decade, the tragic end too, and none of the inspiration.</p> <p><em>Email Janan at </em><a href=\"mailto:janan.ganesh@ft.com\"><em>janan.ganesh@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
