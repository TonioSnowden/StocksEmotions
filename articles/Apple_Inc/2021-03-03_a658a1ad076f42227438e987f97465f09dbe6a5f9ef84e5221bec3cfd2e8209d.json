  "text": "<p>   In \"Big Labor May Save New York From AOC's Socialism\" (Cross Country, Feb. 20), Steven Malanga writes that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \"lacked . . . single endorsement from New York's powerful unions\" in her first campaign. He leaves out that in 2020 AOC was backed by 10 major unions and New York's AFL-CIO. </p><p>   If there were really a schism brewing between labor and New York's democratic socialists, I think I would know. As a City Council candidate endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), I've seen firsthand what the organization is really about. My DSA supporters are a diverse group of Sunset Park residents who organize locally around issues impacting workers. We share a vision of a New York that stops putting billionaires ahead of working people. That's what union workers want, too. </p><p>   Mr. Malanga suggests unions should have a problem with this, but I've found the opposite. Six of New York's most politically influential unions -- representing everyone from hotel workers to nurses to janitors -- back my campaign. And we were recently endorsed by the New York City Central Labor Council, representing the full diversity of New York's unionized working class. When unions and DSA come together, workers win. </p><p>   Mr. Malanga is eager to give unions political advice, but he's against prevailing-wage laws and the union shop. Socialists want union membership to expand, and workers to have political power. Mr. Malanga has the right to disagree, but for many of my supporters, it's more of the same divisive rhetoric. </p><p>    Alexa Aviles </p><p>   Brooklyn, N.Y. </p><p></p>",
