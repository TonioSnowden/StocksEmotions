  "text": "<p>2022 Genesis G80</p><p>2022 Genesis G80&#xa0;starting price:&#xa0;$48,000&#xa0;</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;Plentiful standard equipment; roomy cabin; choice of engines; optional all-wheel drive; long warranty.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;No hybrid option; brand cachet.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;Offering a comprehensive standard equipment list, a roomy cabin, and a choice of powerful engines, the 2022 Genesis G80 makes a case for itself as a contender in the midsize luxury sedan segment. It still does not have the brand recognition of some competitors, if that matters to you.</p><p>2022 BMW 5 Series</p><p>BMW2022 BMW 5 Series&#xa0;starting price:&#xa0;$54,200</p><p>Above average:&#xa0;Choice of engines, including plug-in hybrid; optional all-wheel drive; high-performance M5 variants.</p><p>Below average:&#xa0;Gets expensive quickly, particularly for higher trims.</p><p>Consensus:&#xa0;Among luxury sedans, the 2022 BMW XE:BMW 5 Series is definitely a driver's car. It has a choice of engines, and everything about it is responsive and enjoyable. It offers several M versions, including a limited edition for this year only, although prices rise meteorically.</p><p>G80 vs. 5 Series: grace and power</p><p>Genesis G80</p><p>Now in its second generation, the Genesis G80 continues to impress with a load of standard features, a beautiful cabin, and a choice of powerful engines, all at a starting price thousands below that of many of its competitors.</p><p>Power comes from either a 2.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder in the base model, connected via an 8-speed automatic to the rear wheels or (for $3,150) to all four. The 2.5T is pleasant and comfortable, although not terribly sporty. That job goes to the 3.5T, whose 375 hp comes via a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 with AWD. To go along with that extra thrust, the 3.5T also gets bigger brakes, a sport-tuned adaptive suspension, and now this year, optional rear-wheel steering for even tighter handling. Other differences between the two are the size of wheels, and the 3.5T actually having a slightly different front and rear look as well.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch:I'll have $5 million for retirement when I sell my dental practice next year — but my wife and kids don't want me to retire</p><p>Inside, the cabin is comfortable and plush, with simulated leather and soft-touch plastics, as well as a feeling of quiet and insulation. Front and center is a massive 14.5-inch touchscreen with satellite radio, Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and a 12-speaker audio system. Next to that is an 8-inch instrument cluster that can be upgraded to a 12.3-inch digital screen in the 3.5T. A comprehensive set of driver assistance features includes forward-collision avoidance with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, front and rear parking sensors, and adaptive cruise control.</p><p>The upper trim brings not only the performance goodies but leather upholstery, panoramic roof, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, wireless phone charging, 360-degree camera system, and a 21-speaker/1,050-watt Lexicon audio system.</p><p>BMW 5 Series</p><p>Among luxury sedans, the 2022 BMW 5 Series is the most engaging and the most fun to drive. Steering is crisp and precise, handing is controlled, and it offers a choice of strong engines. Among them is a plug-in hybrid that offers up to 21 miles of pure electric range.</p><p>You might like: The 2022 Lucid Air: a luxury electric vehicle that's quick, quiet and refined</p><p>At the top of the lineup are three different variations from BMW's high-performance M division, with different suspension, brakes, and twin-turbo V8 engines, but the prices can reach well past $100K. Plenty of luxury sedans focus on comfort and smoothing out the bumps. The 5 Series is for people who love driving.</p><p>Once inside, the driver is greeted with 16-way power-adjustable front seats or optionally, 20-way multi-contour seats. Outward vision is good, and the materials are all high quality, with standard simulated leather and either synthetic or real leather on the dash, with twin 12.3-inch screens for driver information and infotainment. Along with those screens come Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, navigation, satellite radio, voice control, two USB ports, and a 205-watt/10-speaker audio system.</p><p>Standard safety features in all 5 Series include forward-collision warning with low-speed automatic emergency braking, active blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-departure warning.</p><p>Also see:The 2022 Lexus ES is all high-quality luxury and superb value</p><p>Besides its twin-turbo V8 and standard all-wheel drive, the M550i xDrive adds leather upholstery, heated and 20-way adjustable front seats, and Harman Kardon surround-sound system. Performance enhancements include a sport differential, adaptive suspension, sport-tuned transmission, uprated brakes, and aerodynamics package.</p><p>Similarities</p><p>Choice of engines; optional all-wheel drive; good standard equipment.</p><p>2022 Genesis G80 advantages</p><p>Lower starting price; long warranty; base power; front and rear legroom.</p><p>2022 BMW 5 Series advantages</p><p>Fuel economy; larger trunk; high-performance M variants; brand cachet.</p><p>Which one is right for me?</p><p>Among luxury sedans, the 2022 Genesis G80 is making headway in a very competitive segment for good reason. It is motivated by a choice of powerful engines, is well-appointed with luxury features inside, has handsome looks, and is competitively priced.</p><p>Check out:The 2023 BMW iX M60 is a faster, high performance version of the electric SUV</p><p>As a driver's car, the 2022 BMW 5 Series is about providing an experience for the driver.
