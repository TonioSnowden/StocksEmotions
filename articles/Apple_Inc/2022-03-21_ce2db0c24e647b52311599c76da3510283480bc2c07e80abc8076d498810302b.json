  "text": "<p>In <em>BioHacked: Family Secrets</em>, a Christmas gift turns the life of its recipient upside down. In 2015, Amber was spending the Christmas break with her husband's family in upstate New York. Among her presents was a home DNA kit through which she hoped to learn more about her family history. What she didn't expect to discover was that the man who raised her wasn't her biological father and that, in order to conceive, her parents had used a sperm donor.</p> <p>Hosted by TJ Raphael, <em>BioHacked</em> looks at how human reproduction became a multimillion-dollar business that, for decades, went unregulated. Most pointedly, the series looks at the personal stories behind the industry. The opening episodes focus on Amber, who hears how her parents decided not to tell their daughter the truth about her parentage unless she asked. She makes contact with a half-sibling, Kaitlin, with whom she teams up to track down their biological father. It doesn't take long for them to locate Kurt, a former medical student who received $25 per sperm donation, which he produced up to three times a week over the course of a year. </p> <p>Kurt, who is interviewed here, is quite a character. He estimates he has fathered around 100 children but says he never wanted to raise a child himself: “I saw the drain that kids bring to your life. My perspective was I wanted to travel, I wanted to go skiing — when I mean skiing, I wanted to ski. I didn't want to take a kid out on the slopes and trying to teach them to ski.”</p> <p>Were you to watch a fictionalised version of this story of a woman who discovers her father isn't her biological father at all and that she has close to 100 siblings, many of whom are now members of a dedicated WhatsApp group, you might accuse it of being too far-fetched. Perhaps the most compelling element of <em>BioHacked</em> is how it asks us to think beyond knee-jerk reactions towards those who feature in it.</p> <p>One might feel compelled to judge Amber's parents for not telling her about the circumstances of her conception until you learn of the stigma that accompanied infertility and how doctors urged their patients to keep quiet. You might feasibly object to Kurt, too, seemingly impervious to the consequences of swapping sperm for cash. But then you meet him and realise he was driven not by money but by a desire to help couples who desperately wanted children. He certainly didn't count on being identified.</p> <p>The real villain here, of course, is the fertility industry that put profit before ethics. The third and most recent episode opens with host Raphael taking Amber on a day trip to a farm where cows are inseminated with gold-standard bull semen. Observing the bulls' extensive paperwork, Amber says, quite reasonably: “How is it fair that this cow has a whole family tree and I don't?”</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/biohacked-family-secrets/id1607121653\"><em>podcasts.apple.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2022 'Biohacked podcast — the woman with 100 siblings and other stories' FT.com 21 March.
