  "text": "<p>The announcements from many of these companies expand on already existing benefits for abortion and other healthcare services.</p><p>Companies are offering the benefits as the landscape of state and federal abortion policy in America is shifting. Texas implemented the country's strictest abortion law last November when it banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy and deputized citizens to enforce the rule. Other states including Idaho, Florida and Oklahoma have passed laws in recent months tightening access to the procedure.</p><p>Earlier this month, a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion indicated the court may be preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 precedent that established a constitutional right to an abortion.</p><p>The 67-page draft, first reported by Politico, declared that Roe was \"egregiously wrong and deeply damaging.\"</p><p>Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement that the draft, written in February, wasn't necessarily the final resolution in the case. The court is expected to issue its opinion by the end of June or early July. </p><p>Demonstrators gather during a rally in support of Roe v. Wade at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington earlier this month. PHOTO: Eric Lee for the Wall Street Journal</p><p>If Roe v. Wade is overturned, it would open the door to stronger state restrictions, including bans on the procedure.</p><p>Companies offering to help employees travel to get an abortion may be on safe legal ground for the moment, but that could change.</p><p>Texas's abortion law extends liability to abortion clinics and doctors, as well as those who aid an abortion. Oklahoma and Idaho have passed similar legislation. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt enacted the law this week, and Idaho's law was temporarily blocked in court. Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have pushed back on the new company policies.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) introduced legislation that would bar companies from receiving tax breaks for funding employees' travel expenses for abortions or for gender-affirming procedures. Mr. Rubio's office said the legislation was a response to efforts by businesses to offer this assistance. Mr. Rubio has little chance of getting a vote on the bill this year because Democrats control the 50-50 Senate.</p><p>Here, a look at some of the companies who have expanded benefits:</p><p>Starbucks</p><p>Starbucks said it is offering to reimburse employees enrolled in its healthcare benefits for travel expenses for abortion or gender-affirming procedures. These costs will be eligible for reimbursement when services aren't available within 100 miles of where a company associate lives. Dependents on Starbucks' healthcare coverage will have access to these benefits as well.</p><p>\"Like many of you, I'm deeply concerned by the draft Supreme Court opinion related to the constitutional right to abortion that was first established by Roe v. Wade,\" Sara Kelly, the company's acting executive vice president for partner resources, said in a letter to company associates. \"I know this is weighing on many of you, so let me be clear up front—regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare.\" </p><p>MANHATTAN, NEW YORK – APRIL 2, 2022 – Pedestrians walk in front of a Starbucks coffee shop. (domestic) Gabby Jones for The Wall Street Journal PHOTO: GABBY JONES for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Microsoft</p><p>Microsoft said it would start providing financial assistance to employees who may need to travel for an abortion or gender-affirming care because of limited availability in their area, a spokesperson for the company said. \"Microsoft will continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees' rights and support employees and their enrolled dependents in accessing critical healthcare—which already includes services like abortion and gender-affirming care—regardless of where they live across the U.S.,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>Tesla</p><p>Tesla, which announced the relocation of its headquarters last October to Austin, Texas, said in its 2021 \"Impact Report\" that the company has an expanded \"health insurance offering that includes travel and lodging support for those who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state.\" Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment last week.</p><p>Amazon</p><p>Amazon.com Inc., based in Seattle, told employees it would reimburse up to $4,000 annually for travel expenses for medical treatments, including abortions, that employees can't access within 100 miles of their homes.</p><p>Citigroup</p><p>Citigroup Inc., in a proxy filing for its April shareholder meeting, said that starting this year it is offering travel benefits for employees to seek resources because of changes in reproductive healthcare laws. More than 10,000 full- and part-time Citi employees live in Texas.</p><p>Yelp</p><p>Yelp Inc., based in San Francisco, is offering employees and their dependents financial assistance through insurance if they need to travel out of state for abortion care. Yelp's health insurance currently covers abortion care.</p><p>Apple</p><p>Tech giant Apple Inc., which is expanding its presence in Austin with a new $1 billion, 3-million-square-foot campus, also said its health-insurance policies cover abortion services and travel fees if necessary.</p><p>Levi Strauss</p><p>California-based Levi Strauss &amp; Co. has said it would reimburse medical travel expenses for full-time and part-time employees.</p><p>Match and Bumble</p><p>Match Group Inc., the parent company of dating apps such as Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge, and dating-app company Bumble Inc. created funds last year to assist employees needing to travel outside of Texas for abortions. Both companies are based in Texas.</p><p>—Allison Prang, Joseph De Avila and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Ginger Adams Otis at Ginger.AdamsOtis@wsj.com and Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>The Companies Paying Travel Costs for Abortions: Starbucks, Tesla, Microsoft, and More</p>",
