  "title": "PC Demand Is Expected to Soften Further as Spending Patterns Shift; Dell warns of a worsening decline after a 17% drop in third-quarter laptop and desktop sales",
  "text": "<p>Dell expects revenue from PC sales to fall at an even steeper rate in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Thomas Sweet said on a Monday earnings call.</p><p>\"We expect ongoing global macroeconomic factors, including slowing economic growth, inflation, rising interest rates and currency pressure, to weigh on our customers,\" he said.</p><p>HP Inc. is scheduled to report quarterly results Tuesday, and analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to post a sharp drop in sales and profit. The computer-and-printer maker in August cautioned that business sales face difficulties ahead after sales declined in the latest quarter.</p><p>The results come a month after data showed that PC demand in October slid at its fastest pace in more than two decades.</p><p>The PC market is slowing down after an acceleration of computer sales during the pandemic, when workers equipped their home offices and students required laptops for remote learning. Pandemic-era restrictions and stimulus payments boosted spending on big-ticket items while travel and entertainment expenses dwindled.</p><p>Now, consumers are changing their spending habits away from goods as they juggle concerns about inflation and the economy.</p><p>Continuing supply-chain constraints coupled with higher interest rates, persistent inflation and a stronger dollar are challenging operations and sapping consumer spending.</p><p>PC makers are adapting to the lower-demand environment. Dell said with customers no longer clamoring for new equipment, the company can use sea freight rather than relying on faster but more expensive airfreight, lowering costs.</p><p>Other tech companies are affected as well. Intel Corp. has embarked on a cost-cutting push and is considering divestitures as the chip maker tries to navigate the sharp drop in PC demand that has weighed on the company's earnings. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. this month issued a glum sales outlook for its current quarter as the chip maker expects demand to soften.</p><p>While most companies are experiencing a slowdown in PC demand, tech giant Apple Inc. reported record revenue for the latest quarter. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri cited new laptop launches and fulfilled pent-up demand after prior supply-chain issues as reasons for the surge in revenue.</p><p>Write to Denny Jacob at denny.jacob@wsj.com</p><p>PC Demand Is Expected to Soften Further as Spending Patterns Shift</p>",
