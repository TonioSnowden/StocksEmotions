  "title": "Amazon Stock Falls as Loss Rattles Investors; Shares fall 12%, on pace for largest one-day drop since October 2011",
  "text": "<p>Megacap growth companies such as Amazon have enjoyed blockbuster earnings and stock performances for much of the past two years, as Americans hunkered down during the Covid-19 pandemic and relied heavily on technology. Now, some of those trends are starting to reverse. Amazon on Thursday reported that its revenue in the first quarter rose about 7%, the slowest pace in about two decades, as consumers returned to prepandemic habits and spent more money in person at stores.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Where do you think Amazon shares will go from here? Weigh in below.</p><p>Investors watch earnings from Amazon and its large-cap tech peers closely, in part because of the outsize influence that their performance has on major indexes. Amazon alone accounts for 4.1% of the market value of the S&amp;P 500, FactSet data show. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.7% Friday.</p><p>A drop of 12% could wipe out roughly $177 billion of Amazon's nearly $1.5 trillion market capitalization.</p><p>U.S. technology companies are navigating a difficult environment as they try to get a handle on changing consumer habits, soaring inflation, labor shortages and supply-chain crunches. Even more, they are vulnerable to rising interest rates. Higher yields can make growth stocks less appealing because they reduce the value that investors place on future earnings.</p><p>It had already been a tough year for Amazon's stock. Including Friday's stumble, the retailer has fallen 24% this year, worse than the S&amp;P 500's 11% loss.</p><p>Still, the stock has performed better than some of its peers. Netflix Inc. has plunged 67% year-to-date and tumbled severely after the streaming service reported it had lost subscribers in the first quarter. Google parent Alphabet Inc. is down 19% for the year. This week, the company posted its slowest sales growth since late 2020.</p><p>Of the megacap technology stocks, only Apple Inc. has performed better this year, with a loss of 8.4% in 2022. Its shares lost 0.6% Friday. The iPhone maker on Thursday reported revenue that far exceeded analysts' expectations, though the company cautioned that the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in China threatens to hinder sales by as much as $8 billion in the current quarter.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon Stock Falls as Loss Rattles Investors</p>",
