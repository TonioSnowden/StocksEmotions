  "title": "What to Know as U.S., Allies Put Sanctions on Russia; The U.S. and Europe are imposing a crippling package of economic penalties for Russia",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Biden vowed that the measures would be crippling. European allies have followed suit and introduced separate penalties, showing a unity of purpose that often eluded past sanctions efforts by the U.S. Iconic Western multinationals, from Apple Inc. and Boeing Co. to Exxon Mobil Corp. and PepsiCo, have pulled back or curtailed their Russian operations in protest of the invasion, to avoid running afoul of the penalties or because sanctions are hampering delivering goods and getting paid.</p><p>As Russia's invasion presses on, some possible punishments initially left off the target list were brought on. The U.S. and its allies in Europe overcame differences and said they would disconnect some Russian banks from Swift, the financial-messaging infrastructure that links the world's banks. The U.S., after initially resisting, banned imports of Russian oil and other energy products.</p><p>Biden administration officials have said some of the penalties, like the blacklisting of major banks, are designed to reverberate immediately through the Russian economy, while others, such as export controls on certain technology products, would exact pain on Russian industrial and defense sectors over the longer term. Meanwhile, concerns remain that Russia could use its oil and gas exports as a weapon, as some Russian officials have suggested, disrupting markets, raising the costs to European and other consumers, but also adding to Russia's economic woes.</p><p>What are the latest sanctions and other measures to be issued?</p><p>The U.S. and European Union are making Russia's financial system a prime target are beginning to ban its energy exports and are looking at removing the preferential, low-tariff trade status accorded to almost all nations. The goal, the allies say, is to curtail the Kremlin's ability to wage war. The U.S. and EU blocked the Russian central bank from selling dollars, euros and other foreign currencies in its reserves stockpile, constraining its ability to stabilize the ruble and fight inflation. Sanctions on a sovereign-wealth fund limit its ability to raise money abroad.</p><p>The U.S., EU, the U.K. and Canada announced plans to remove some Russian banks from the Swift financial network, hampering their ability to operate globally.</p><p>The U.S. blacklisted VTB and Sberbank, Russia's biggest financial institutions, and added dozens of other financial institutions to sanctions rolls. All told, the Treasury Department said, the actions target 80% of all banking assets in Russia and limit the country's access to the global financial system.</p><p>The Biden administration has also barred American individuals and firms from dealing in Russian sovereign debt, cutting off a key funding source for Kremlin objectives.</p><p>Allies in Europe are taking similar moves. The EU plans sanctions that will cut 70% of Russia's banking system off from international financial markets. In the U.K., the government said it would place sanctions on more than 100 Russian entities and pass legislation to bar the Russian government and several major state-linked companies from issuing debt in the U.K.</p><p>Together, the U.S., its allies in Europe and elsewhere also restricted exports of certain technologies to Russia, and in the U.S.'s case, to Russian ally Belarus.</p><p>The U.S. and EU export controls target Russia's defense, aerospace and maritime industries. The restrictions apply to semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers and sensors.</p><p>Those restrictions cover items produced in the U.S. as well as foreign items made using U.S. equipment, software and blueprints, according to the Commerce Department, applying a tactic it used to batter the Chinese telecommunications networking equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co.</p><p>The EU also is banning the sale of aircraft and spare parts to Russia, as well as some products in the energy sector that officials said will make it hard for Russia to upgrade oil refineries. The U.S. restricted the sale of extraction equipment for Russia's oil-and-gas industry.</p><p>How has Russian President Vladimir Putin responded?</p><p>Mr. Putin has been undeterred by U.S. and European sanctions, proceeding with a further invasion of Ukraine on multiple fronts. In announcing what he called the \"special military operation\" against Ukraine, Mr. Putin also warned of retaliation if others try to interfere.</p><p>Russia is a critical supplier of energy and other resources, accounting for 40% of the EU's natural gas supplies last year. A concern among Western policy makers is that Russia could cut off or reduce that supply—a shock that would be felt not only by consumers in Europe but across global markets.</p><p>The Biden administration banned imports of Russian oil, certain petroleum products, liquefied natural gas and coal, though only about 8% of U.S. imports of oil and refined products come from Russia. The European Union is promising to cut its imports of Russian natural gas by two-thirds by the end of this year, while the U.K. said it would end Russian oil imports, currently 8% of the nation's demand, by the end of the year. The U.S. has also been trying to persuade oil and natural gas suppliers to try to arrange for stopgap supplies.</p><p>Beyond energy, the Biden administration has banned imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds and is moving to sever normal trade ties. Removing the low tariff treatment accorded most nations, known as most-favored-nation trade status, requires the assent of Congress.</p><p>Collectively the leaders of the Group of Seven affluent democracies have also pledged to remove that preferential trade status for key Russian products and organize a broad coalition of World Trade Organization members to do the same. The G7 also said they were working to prevent Russia from obtaining financing from leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Moscow has tried to make its economy more resistant to sanctions, following the imposition of more limited sanctions by the U.S. and Europe in 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region and fomented pro-Russian separatist rebellions in the country's east.</p><p>Russia has weaned itself off the dollar and reduced the share of its debt held by foreign investors. The government has run a conservative fiscal policy and kept its government debt under 20% of GDP, compared with 133% in the U.S., according to IMF data. It has also amassed a significant financial buffer, with international reserves, including gold holdings and foreign currency, reaching an all-time high of $630 billion in December, one of the world's biggest, according to central bank data.</p><p>What impact are the economic penalties likely to have?</p><p>Biden administration officials have said the penalties are designed to weaken the ruble, crash Russia's stock market and over time erode the Russian economy, which is highly dependent on energy exports, and sap support for Mr. Putin. Since Western allies moved against its financial system and central bank reserves, Russia has shut its stock market, staving off an expected fire sale. Despite capital controls aimed at keeping the ruble from sinking, the currency has lost around a third of its value against the dollar this year to all time lows.</p><p>Among the targets of Western sanctions are members of the Russian elite, key principals in Mr. Putin's inner circle such as Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and Mr. Putin himself. The EU is freezing any assets Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov hold in the bloc, but they aren't being subjected to a travel ban, according to EU officials and diplomats, to keep open a channel for diplomacy.</p><p>The U.S. measures, announced by the White House, include a travel ban on Mr. Putin and an asset freeze. The moves are intended to politically isolate Mr. Putin on the world stage, according to former officials. Russia specialists say Mr. Putin's wealth is largely held in the names of associates, blunting the impact of sanctions.</p><p>The Justice Department launched a new task force to hunt down and seize the luxury real estate, private jets, yachts and other assets of Russian oligarchs stashed around the globe.</p><p>French authorities said they seized a yacht belonging to a company majority owned by Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Russian oil producer Rosneft. The U.K. followed, freezing Mr. Sechin's assets and imposing a travel ban on him.</p><p>The U.S., which has blacklisted Russian oligarchs in the past, has broadened the moves during the Ukraine crisis, targeting relatives as well.</p><p>The U.K., which has been a magnet for Russia's wealthy, said it would now limit the funds Russian nationals may deposit in banks to £50,000, or about $67,000, and would ban Russian national carrier Aeroflot's aircraft from landing in Britain's airports, which include international hubs like Heathrow.</p><p>Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of British soccer club Chelsea FC who had previously escaped being sanctioned, saw that status change two weeks into the war. The U.K. government ordered a freeze on Mr. Abramovich's U.K. assets and blocks his travel to Britain. Mr. Abramovich previously said he would sell his soccer club following calls by some British lawmakers for him to be sanctioned over his past ties to the Kremlin. Any sale is blocked under the sanctions, though the government said it would provide a special license to allow Chelsea to continue to operate.</p><p>Has Russia been sanctioned in the past?</p><p>The U.S. and EU have sanctioned the Russian government and its operatives for past actions, including the use of a nerve agent against a former spy and his daughter in the U.K. and alleged human-rights abuses. Russian mercenary company Wagner Group and its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of Mr. Putin, have also been blacklisted.</p><p>Russia was removed from the Group of 8 industrialized nations in March 2014 following its occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea; the grouping reverted to its former moniker, the Group of 7.</p><p>During the Trump administration, the U.S. also sanctioned companies working on the construction of Nord Stream 2, the Russian-backed pipeline carrying natural gas to Germany that U.S. officials have long warned Moscow would use as a geopolitical weapon. The Biden administration in May 2021 sanctioned Nord Stream 2 AG, the Swiss-registered company behind the project, and its chief executive, but then set aside any penalties, in a move seen as a gesture to Berlin, which supported the pipeline.</p><p>After Mr. Putin said Russia would recognize the independence of two Russian-backed breakaway regions, setting the stage for the invasion, the Biden administration reinstated those sanctions for Nord Stream 2. That came after Germany said it was suspending the project.</p><p>Nord Stream 2 AG then laid off its staff—more than 100 workers—and wound down its operations, according to a Swiss official.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>Write to Courtney McBride at courtney.mcbride@wsj.com, Ian Talley at Ian.Talley@wsj.com and Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com</p><p>What to Know as U.S., Allies Put Sanctions on Russia</p>",
