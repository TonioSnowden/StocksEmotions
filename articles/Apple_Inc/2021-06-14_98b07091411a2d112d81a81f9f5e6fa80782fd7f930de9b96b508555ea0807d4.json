  "title": "U.S. News:  McGahn's Records Subpoenaed in 2018  ---  FBI sought information  from Apple on account  of former White House  lawyer amid leak probe  ----  By Aruna Viswanatha and Sadie Gurman",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department subpoenaed Apple Inc. for information about an account belonging to Donald Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn in February 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The disclosure came amid political fallout from revelations that the Trump administration also secretly sought the records of journalists and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, at a time when officials were trying to locate the source of leaks of sensitive information to the media. </p><p>   The former president in particular had complained about a series of leaks related to contacts between Russia and figures in his 2016 election campaign, and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into them. </p><p>   It isn't yet clear what FBI agents were investigating when they sought information about Mr. McGahn, who served as the top legal adviser to Mr. Trump and was also a key witness in Mr. Mueller's probe. </p><p>   Apple didn't tell Mr. McGahn what it provided to the government, and the Justice Department barred the company from telling him about the subpoena at the time, the person familiar with the matter said. Apple informed Mr. McGahn in May, a move first reported by the New York Times. </p><p>   Mr. McGahn and Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. </p><p>   Department officials have so far declined to comment on its subpoenas for records of reporters and lawmakers, citing an inspector-general investigation into whether they were proper. </p><p>   Apple in May also notified individuals associated with the House Intelligence Committee that the Justice Department had issued grand-jury subpoenas for their information in February 2018, a House committee official said. </p><p>   It is unusual for the Justice Department to issue subpoenas for lawmakers' records and those of a sitting White House counsel. </p><p>   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Sunday that former attorneys general William Barr and Jeff Sessions should testify under oath about those requests. Both men have said they weren't aware of any leak case in which subpoenas were sought for information related to lawmakers' records. </p><p>   \"We will have to have them come under oath to testify about that,\" Mrs. Pelosi said on CNN Sunday. The statement echoed recent calls by Senate Democrats. </p><p>   While the Senate is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, Democrats hold the majority in the House and could move unilaterally to issue subpoenas seeking the former officials' testimony. </p><p>   Mrs. Pelosi questioned how Messrs. Barr and Sessions could be unaware of such an investigation into congressmen and the press. </p><p>   \"No matter who is president, whatever party, this cannot be the way it goes,\" she said. </p><p>   Republicans expressed concern about the subpoenas targeting the House panel and said they support the inspector general's probe, but haven't called for the former attorneys general to testify before Congress. </p><p>   \"With a member of Congress, obviously, you'd better have your facts together before you do something like this,\" Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas) said Sunday on ABC. </p><p>   Asked whether Messrs. Sessions and Barr should testify under oath, he said: \"I think we need to know why this decision was made. . .That's within the proper purview of the IG,\" referring to the department's inspector general. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ryan Tracy contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
