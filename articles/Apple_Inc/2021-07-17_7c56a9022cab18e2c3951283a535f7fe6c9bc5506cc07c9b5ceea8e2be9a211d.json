  "text": "<p>   Following meetings like this, Mr. Neumann often pushed for bigger ideas, aides said. One was a plan to dive head first into the business of owning buildings -- a change from WeWork's business model of leasing from other landlords. To do this, Mr. Neumann wanted to raise by far the world's largest real-estate fund overnight -- $100 billion by the end of the year. He called it ARK -- inspired in part by Noah's Ark -- and he initially asked to have a personal stake in the fund, until lawyers convinced him it would be too messy a conflict to have WeWork effectively leasing so many properties from its CEO. With the fund, he planned to co-develop the final office tower at the World Trade Center site, among other ambitious projects. </p><p>   In the late spring of 2018, Mr. Neumann called a few senior executives into a meeting. He took out a sheet of paper and a pen. He scrawled out three lines -- forming a simple triangle. This, he told them, was WeWork's future. </p><p>   One corner of the triangle signified WeWork's main office business. Another was ARK, the real-estate ownership arm. And then on the third corner were services -- the sprawling set of businesses such as brokerages and cleaners that help the real-estate sector hum. </p><p>   Next to each corner, attendees watched as he wrote \"$1 trillion.\" Each arm of WeWork, he said, would be a $1 trillion business on its own. </p><p>   Mr. Neumann had recently had an epiphany, he told those assembled. What if someone owned the whole system? What if WeWork vertically integrated it all? WeWork would own buildings, it would build buildings, it would lease buildings. It would rent apartments. WeWork would advise companies on their office space -- becoming the sole solution. If companies wanted to stay in their own buildings, WeWork would design them; then it would lease them desks, run their coffee machines, sell them software. A WeWork ID could open WeWork-run security gates. If tenants wanted to lease with someone else, WeWork would find them space and get a broker's fee. It could be huge. </p><p>   Unlike his earlier scattershot acquisition strategy, executives around him said they saw in this vision real potential to disrupt the entire real-estate sector. </p><p>   The triangle strategy would require truckloads of money, but it could reshape everything if it worked. </p><p>   In late spring of 2018, Mr. Neumann and some deputies traveled to Tokyo for another meeting with Mr. Son. Initially unsure whether to spill the beans on his big plan, Mr. Neumann sensed Mr. Son was in a good mood, aides said. </p><p>   It was time to drop the bigger idea. He laid out his triangle plan. Together, he made clear, they could build something worth trillions, by far the largest company on earth. </p><p>   It was the exact type of big-thinking vision Mr. Son was looking for. He was intrigued. He wanted to learn more -- to think about how to do a deal. </p><p>   The Tokyo pitch kicked off a series of meetings throughout the summer involving senior staff from both companies who raced into high gear putting together a giant plan code-named Project Fortitude. In June and July, in Tokyo, in New York, and in San Francisco, Mr. Neumann, Mr. Son, and their respective staffs repeatedly met up to hash out just what the plan would look like and just how much money WeWork would need. </p><p>   It was a lot. To accomplish what he envisioned, Mr. Neumann told Mr. Son in a meeting in New York at the start of July, he wanted $70 billion, according to a copy of his presentation. It was a gargantuan number. The entire Vision Fund was $100 billion. Uber -- which raised more than any startup ever -- had raised about $12 billion total in its existence. </p><p>   Mr. Neumann and his team showered Mr. Son with projections of voracious growth that WeWork was planning, should a deal come together. He sketched out how WeWork was set to have 14 million people working in its offices in 2023 -- more than the population of Belgium -- up from 420,000 in 2018. It would mean upward of one billion square feet of real estate, more than twice the size of the entire Manhattan office market. </p><p>   The WeWork unit that rented space to large corporations was thriving, according to data in a presentation he showed Mr. Son. If its largest subtenant, Amazon.com Inc., kept its growth rate up, it would have 200,000 desks with WeWork by 2023 -- a rather heady projection for any company. </p><p>   All of this would be lucrative, Mr. Neumann explained in his presentation. WeWork's main business alone would hit $101 billion in revenue by 2023, up from the $2.3 billion planned in 2018. </p><p>   Together with ARK and the services arms of WeWork, the projections called for a jaw-dropping $358 billion in revenue in 2023. (Apple, by comparison, had $266 billion in revenue in 2018.) </p><p>   The giant numbers -- the requests for unprecedented sums -- didn't scare off Mr. Son. </p><p>   Investment in growth was often necessary before the demand was clear, Mr. Son told Mr. Neumann. In the midst of the negotiations, before he drew the Yoda picture, he offered an analogy for the WeWork team relating to the chicken and the egg, attendees said. WeWork had to build first -- show the world a finished product -- and then demand would follow. The chicken -- the finished product -- came before the egg. </p><p>   As with the \"10k\" dictate, this advice was memorialized on the Yoda image: \"Chicken First!!\" </p><p>   As Mr. Son pushed Mr. Neumann for more, and as the two charted out the future, their plans tested the boundaries of the world's financial system. One slide from a presentation about ARK, for instance, showed how ARK's growth plans depended on $593 billion from investors and lenders -- an amount that would represent a sizable chunk of the United States' entire commercial real-estate finance system. </p><p>   The prize would be extraordinary growth in value that the world had never seen. In a room in WeWork's headquarters, working alongside Mr. Neumann, Mr. Son pulled up on his iPad WeWork's chart that showed a hockey-stick-like growth curve for WeWork's main business. By 2028, he wrote, WeWork's main business would have 100 million members and hit $500 billion in revenue. Then he assigned it a valuation, adding together what he projected for ARK and services. </p><p>   He scribbled in yellow ink, \"$10 T,\" and underlined it twice. The value of the entire U.S. stock market was about $30 trillion. But Mr. Son had big plans: WeWork would be worth $10 trillion by 2028. </p><p>   Sufficiently bullish on WeWork's future, Mr. Son agreed to a deal. It wouldn't be as big as the $70 billion Mr. Neumann wanted, but it would be something giant. </p><p>   Negotiating through the summer and into the fall, they eventually settled on a plan: Mr. Son would buy out all of Mr. Neumann's existing investors for about $10 billion and put another $10 billion into WeWork, giving SoftBank ownership of most of the company while leaving Mr. Neumann as the only other large owner remaining. </p><p>   To get the deal in motion, WeWork had SoftBank commit to giving it $3 billion up front -- a nonrefundable deposit of sorts. </p><p>   Negotiations carried on through the fall of 2018. WeWork executives said Mr. Neumann was confident the deal was going to go through, so he began accelerating WeWork's plans before SoftBank's check arrived. The company began to invest heavily in building out the third point of the triangle -- services. Staff ballooned, especially in departments that helped companies manage their own office space. Mr. Neumann pushed staff for more acquisitions, and pondered buying rival real-estate companies. </p><p>   A main goal he emphasized with aides: revenue growth. Almost anything could fit the bill. Mr. Neumann held talks to buy Sweetgreen. He told aides he wanted to buy ride-hailing company Lyft Inc., and began negotiating an investment in them, according to people familiar with the situation. Mr. Son, a backer of Uber, found out and told WeWork executives he was upset. WeWork's losses, already monstrous, continued to march upward. </p><p>   By Thanksgiving, the deal was nearly done, but the talks dragged on partly because Mr. Neumann and his lawyers continued to renegotiate his part of the deal -- his compensation and his contract. </p><p>   Mr. Neumann wanted the right to own an additional 9% of the company if he hit certain targets -- an amount that could mean tens of billions of dollars based on the targets they were discussing, people involved in the talks said. </p><p>   Beyond compensation, he wanted assurances that he would stay in control -- even though Mr. Son was putting up all the money. </p><p>   SoftBank, however, wanted clauses so it could remove him under certain circumstances. Mr. Neumann negotiated to the point where SoftBank wouldn't be able to remove him -- without paying a large penalty -- if he went to jail on just any felony, for example. His lawyers pushed for a provision where he would have to commit a violent felony before SoftBank could remove him without penalty, people familiar with the talks said. </p><p>   As the end of 2018 neared, as Mr. Neumann's personal negotiations finished up, everything looked on track. </p><p>   Then, the stock markets began to rattle. </p><p>   Already, SoftBank's own shareholders were growing wary. SoftBank's biggest backers -- sovereign-wealth funds in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi -- weren't interested in the WeWork buyout. They viewed WeWork as overvalued and not in line with the tech-focused strategy of the Vision Fund, among other factors, people familiar with the deal said. That meant that SoftBank would need to put up the $20 billion itself -- an enormous check even for SoftBank. </p><p>   Adding to concerns was a broad pullback of tech stocks across the globe and a poorly timed spinout of SoftBank's Japanese telecom unit that had one of the worst-ever stock-market performances immediately post-IPO in Japan. </p><p>   SoftBank's shares began to fall, and fall. </p><p></p>",
