  "title": "Senate Panel Approves Antitrust Bill Restricting Big Tech Platforms; Bill would make it illegal for Amazon, Google, Apple and others to favor their products over competitors'",
  "text": "<p>The bill \"is specifically designed to target a small number of specific companies, most of which are headquartered in my home state,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who criticized elements of the bill along with fellow California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla. \"It's difficult to see the justification for a bill that regulates the behavior of only a handful of companies while allowing everyone else to continue engaging in that exact same behavior.\"</p><p>The bill targets dominant tech platforms, including Amazon.com Inc.'s e-commerce site, Alphabet Inc.'s Google search engine, Apple Inc.'s App Store, and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook. Those companies have been working for months to stop or alter the bill, deploying teams of lobbyists and top executives to Washington. Some have funded advocacy groups that oppose the measure and publicly warned that the bill could disrupt popular services.</p><p>Supporters, which include smaller tech companies such as Yelp Inc. and Sonos Inc., say the bills will benefit consumers by boosting competition on platforms that are abusing their market power. Senators in favor of the bill say it makes exceptions that will protect features consumers like.</p><p>\"This bill is not meant to break up Big Tech or destroy the products and services they offer,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the top Republican on the judiciary panel. \"The goal of the bill is to prevent conduct that stifles competition.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, lawmakers amended the bill Thursday to address concerns by the industry. One new provision is designed to include large foreign-owned tech platforms such as the popular TikTok app owned by China's ByteDance Ltd., said Mr. Grassley.</p><p>The top Republican on the judiciary panel's antitrust subcommittee, Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), said he shared concerns about monopoly power in the tech industry, but worried the bill was written too broadly and could cause \"collateral damage.\"</p><p>\"It may actually entrench the very four companies at which it is aimed by creating a strong incentive to simply cease doing any business with third parties,\" Mr. Lee said. \"This could crush thousands of small businesses and it could actually worsen the state of competition in online markets.\"</p><p>Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com</p><p>Senate Panel Approves Antitrust Bill Restricting Big Tech Platforms</p>",
