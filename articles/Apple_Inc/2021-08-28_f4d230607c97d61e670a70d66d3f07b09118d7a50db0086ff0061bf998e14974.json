  "title": "Travel (A Special Report)  ---  Traveling Off The Beaten Path, Kids in Tow:  My husband and I were determined to take our three children where family travelers rarely go -- from China to Uzbekistan and beyond  ----  By Heidi Mitchell",
  "text": "<p>   My kids love a good travel dining dare. </p><p>   There was that time we ate horse in Uzbekistan, which my older son admits was quite gamy. The fried scorpions in a Beijing alley tasted \"crunchy,\" my younger son recalls. Dried giraffe in Kenya? It was a dead ringer for beef jerky, my daughter, the youngest, says. </p><p>   In far-off places, trying exotic street foods has become our family's way to immerse ourselves in a foreign culture. Gross? Sometimes. Tasty? Often. But my kids' sense of adventure is my proudest achievement as a mother. </p><p>   It took a while to get here. </p><p>   Ten years ago, when my oldest was eight, a quesadilla was about as interesting a cuisine as the kids would enjoy, and Mexico was the most far-off land we had explored as a family. </p><p>   This wasn't how I imagined parenthood was going to be. Before having children, my husband and I had backpacked through India, bused across South America, camped around sub-Saharan Africa, crisscrossed Asia on every form of cheap transportation. Somehow that wanderlust vanished when I got pregnant. </p><p>   By the time we had three children under the age of 6, we had unwittingly accepted that all-inclusive resorts were as good a family vacation as these tired souls could muster. What happened to those swashbucklers with full passports on a quest for the new, the novel, the unexpected? </p><p>   Not gone forever, we pinky-promised in 2012, as we'd enrolled our progeny at a Mandarin-immersion school. </p><p>   Once our youngest was closing in on 5 and could maybe appreciate some culture, we vowed to reclaim the fearless spirit of our youth -- with our children. China would be on the calendar for summer 2013, and scorpion would be on the menu. </p><p>   In August 2013, we boarded a flight bound for a two-week journey across eastern and southern China, hitting the best-known cities, yes, but also Hangzhou, Guilin, and the stepped rice paddies of Longsheng. </p><p>   The kids used their newly acquired language skills to engage with shopkeepers who chuckled at these little blond Americans trading renminbi for sweets. In some back alley in Beijing, the 8-year-old, always on the make, found a stash of the yogurt drinks he coveted and greedily sucked their straws, only to learn from a concerned passerby that he had plucked them from a recycling pile. </p><p>   That was far funnier than when, earlier in the week, he had eaten what was supposedly the world's hottest chile pepper at a roadside tea shop on a challenge from his older brother. He chugged so much water, we had to stop every 30 minutes on the three-hour drive from the Li River to the rice paddies. </p><p>   There also was an unfortunate incident in Shanghai's China Pearl Tower, when the 5-year-old shoved an actual pearl up her nose. But other than those 45 harrowing seconds, my husband and I ignored irrational fears of kidnapping, starvation or boredom. </p><p>   My friends thought I was crazy at best or indulgent at worst to take three kids 10 and under across the globe, but the farther we got from the somewhat familiar international cities, the more confident at trying new things and engaging in Chinese culture we all became. If travel heightens our emotions, this first family outing somehow accentuated only the positive. </p><p>   We broke the rigid rules of home life, and we laughed at our shared mistakes. We became a team. </p><p>   Having had success in choosing a destination that dovetailed with the kids' curricula, we attempted to tie each big annual trip to the classroom. I had always dreamed of visiting Turkey, and its pristine Roman ruins aligned with what my rising sixth-grader would be studying in the fall of 2014. We dropped into the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Greek and Roman Art departments a couple of times that summer, and watched the 1981 film \"Gallipoli\" to get everyone jazzed. </p><p>   Along with iPads, the kids -- now 11, 9 and almost 6 -- requested a few non-negotiables: hotels with pools and a bed for each child, some beach time and a little bit of freedom. </p><p>   My husband and I had some stipulations of our own: overnight flights to start the first day fresh, breakfast included to expedite mornings, and keep expectations low so as not to disappoint. As we had done in China, we hired a tour company, this time orchestrating a family road trip down Turkey's Turquoise Coast. </p><p>   We satisfied the freedom request early on. In Istanbul, we handed each son $20 in Turkish lira and set them free (tracking apps switched on) to wander the Grand Bazaar. They had to meet us back in an hour at a coffee shop to see who scored the best bargain. One son landed a hand-carved wooden chess set, the other a sword and scabbard, which still hangs on his wall. (My daughter and I got personalized fragrances from a perfume stall.) Gamifying historic places has since become our standard unsolicited advice when friends ask about taking their young kids abroad. </p><p>   Yet despite all the research and orchestrated play, we packed way too much in -- a rookie mistake. </p><p>   Each day we would load up the van and move to the next Important Destination. Every stop seemed rushed, and the breathtaking ruins weren't received with the awe I had envisioned. The kids were grumpy; they mortified us by climbing a statue commemorating a famous speech by Ataturk, and shimmying up the flagpole. Sigh. We were the Ugly Americans. </p><p>   In Izmir, I recorded the mesmerizing call to prayer on my iPhone in reverence; they begged mercilessly for ice cream. Settling into our last stop and chillaxing on the beach was, sadly, salvation. On future travels, we'd know to loosen the itinerary and leave midday free for pool time. And ice cream. </p><p>   That winter, on my daughter's sixth birthday, we boarded a plane bound for Kenya, with a pit stop in Zanzibar, off the Tanzanian mainland, mostly fueled by my older son's obsession with Freddie Mercury (who was born in Zanzibar). We figured we'd acclimate with some beach time for Christmas, then do a proper safari over New Year's. </p><p>   Those first few days were awesome: waking at our leisure, foraging for food on the beach, swimming at high tide, playing some soccer with local kids on the sand. </p><p>   Our family's first safari, however, was unsatisfactory for 20% of our crew. Getting up at 5 a.m. to witness wildlife hunt their own breakfast wasn't to my daughter's liking. She isn't a morning person. \"I just want to see the lions, then get on the next plane back to New York!\" was her daily refrain. (This is now a phrase we all repeat when we're bored; it also launched the creation of \"The Book,\" a list of the funniest one-liners proclaimed on various trips.) </p><p>   We acquiesced and left her with the camp manager during those daybreak safaris and let the boys take turns driving the Land Rover across the Masai Mara. She missed the cheetah catching a young gazelle but didn't mind; she was busy making bracelets with the camp manager's daughters. Some experiences are best left for later years. </p><p>   And some are best forgotten. Deep in the creases of my brain is my least favorite memory of any family trip. There had been some bombings in Nairobi that spring, and I recall us being pulled from the taxi and separated from our bags by Kenyan security about a mile from the airport terminal. I was terrified. </p><p>   We made it through, only to have my overheated husband, weighted down by luggage, taken out of the line inside to check his vitals. Kenya was at high risk for Ebola at that time, and his sweaty face posed an obvious threat. </p><p>   Those minutes apart felt like hours. I think the kids cried, I'm sure I did, but I've erased the details. Which is just fine by me. </p><p>   There were plenty of other trips after that -- to Scotland, Norway, Oman, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Austria, Costa Rica and Mexico a few times. Though we are on a bit of a pandemic pause, we collectively agree that immersing in foreign cultures is woven into our family values, but our traveling habits have changed since those first few journeys. </p><p>   We now take a truly laissez faire approach to the family vacation -- not too dissimilar from the way my husband and I traveled when we were child-free. With the kids in middle school, high school and almost college, they are at the age where they enjoy figuring out a new place on their own. </p><p>   When we went to southern Spain in the summer of 2019 to practice Spanish and learn about the Moors, we had a rough sense of where we wanted to go -- Seville, Cordoba, Granada -- but we didn't book anything in advance. Instead, we found rooms (with a pool) on HotelTonight, arranged train tickets at the station and moved at our own pace. </p><p>   This posed a few problems, like when we arrived at Alhambra only to find that all tickets were sold out. No worries. We spent an extra night and joined a group tour the following day. </p><p>   Over the 2019-2020 winter holidays, we mapped a vague loop around Israel, but thought we could take trains, so didn't bother booking a car. The delivery truck we eventually rented (\"The last car in Israel, sir!\") still makes me cry with laughter when I conjure its image. We had reservations only for the first night of the trip, so we had the freedom to stay longer in Jerusalem than anticipated, drive up to Galilee and sleep in a kibbutz, and loiter in two crummy hotel rooms with good Wi-Fi as it rained buckets over Tel Aviv. </p><p>   When the clouds cleared, and my husband and I suggested we venture off to spy Bauhaus architecture (a particular passion of ours, which the children don't share), the three kids asked if they could explore the streets together, without parents. I felt a profound sense of pride as they slipped out of view. All those years of schlepping three kids to far-off lands with different alphabets and customs and people and food had given them the confidence to wander a foreign city unsupervised, in pursuit of their own adventures. </p><p></p>",
