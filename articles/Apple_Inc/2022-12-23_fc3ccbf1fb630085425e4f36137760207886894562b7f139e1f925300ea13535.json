Comfort and tech levels are high, all-wheel drive is standard throughout, and that renowned Audi style keeps the Q7 desirable. Prices start at $57,500.</p><p>Some rivals are newer and cheaper, but the 2023 Q7 remains a serious contender in the midsize luxury SUV class. That's because Audi has done things right and given the Q7 attributes that can appeal to many people.</p><p>As well as the unmistakable style and indisputable quality, the Q7 can even tempt enthusiasts with its turbocharged V6 and V8 engines. This is an ideal luxury vehicle for well-off families.</p><p>2023 Audi Q7 pricing</p><p>There are only three versions of the 2023 Audi Q7 luxury 3-row SUV. The model with the 45 TSFI drivetrain starts the proceedings with a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $57,500, plus a destination charge. It's available in Premium and Premium Plus trim.</p><p>Offered in all three trim levels, which includes Prestige, the 55 TSFI variant begins at $63,100. The higher-performance SQ7 dispenses with the lowest trim level and starts at $88.5K. An SQ7 in Prestige trim and a lavish amount of options could easily reach $105K.</p><p>Even so, the 2023 Q7 is not overpriced compared with its German rivals. A 2-row BMW XE:BMW X5 with all-wheel drive starts at $64K, and a Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class 4Matic is more like $59K minus a third seating row.</p><p>The Acura MDX, Volvo VLVLY XC90, and Lincoln Aviator—all with three rows as standard — provide keener starting prices in the low $50K range. The Genesis GV80 is closer to $55.5K, but has a lot of standard equipment.</p><p>Before buying a new Q7 or new SQ7, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for theirs. The Lexus RX and Acura have the strongest resale values in this class, with the Audi Q7 faring at least as well as the X5 and GLE-Class.</p><p>Driving the 2023 Audi Q7</p><p>School runs, grocery trips, and general forays around suburbia are handled competently enough by the turbocharged 4-cylinder engine in the 45 TSFI drivetrain. The ride quality is smooth, but not loose. And there's the reassurance of all-wheel drive in every 2023 Q7 luxury SUV.</p><p>Comfort and power levels both increase in the 55 TSFI version. A turbocharged V6 delivers 329 horsepower, and the top Prestige model adds an adaptive air suspension. This trim is also eligible for all-wheel steering, adding extra agility and maneuverability.</p><p>The 2023 SQ7 comes standard with a sport-tuned version of that adaptive air suspension, as well as all-wheel steering. Not many family vehicles offer a 500-horsepower twin-turbocharged V8, but the SQ7 might work out cheaper than regular visits to Disneyland, yet still provide thrilling rides.</p><p>Check out: Here are the 10 fastest EVs (and how much they cost)</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>Heated front seats, accommodations for seven, and leather seating surfaces are all standard in a cabin that's well designed, incredibly tidy, full of first-rate materials, and tingling with technology.</p><p>A 10.1-inch touchscreen at the top of the center console deals with the infotainment system, while an 8.6-inch touchscreen set just below handles various vehicle functions like climate control. And the 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster is another standard feature in the 2023 Q7 luxury midsize SUV.</p><p>This year sees the addition of simulated leather covering for the dashboard, while Premium Plus trim adds it to the armrests and center console.</p><p>Legroom for the second row measures 38.8 inches — easy to live with. The third row is a tight 29.2 inches. It's the kids' zone. Cargo space goes from 14.2 to 69.6 cubic feet. Not that great in the context of this midsize 3-row SUV class, but at least the second and third rows fold almost flat.</p><p>Don't miss: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>Audi's restrained styling philosophy has a twofold benefit with the 2023 Q7. Usually, midsize 3-row SUVs aren't noticeably aerodynamic, but the Q7 has a drag coefficient of 0.32 — that's better than the BMW X5.</p><p>The other upside is that, for a 7-seater SUV, the Q7 is arguably good-looking. It enhances its style with additions like aluminum roof rails, animated light sequences for the turn signals, plus the option of laser-based headlights for a larger and brighter pool of light thrown out in front of the vehicle. Matrix-design LED headlights (made up of many small LEDs) become standard in the upper Premium Plus trim of the 45 TSFI version.</p><p>The base model has 19-inch alloy wheels. For the first time, the SQ7 offers 22-inch alloys, with a choice of two designs, both wearing summer performance tires. A Black Optic package for the entire range brings a black finish for various exterior elements.</p><p>New colors this year — all metallic — are Waitomo Blue, Tamarind Brown, and Satellite Silver.</p><p>Six cool features</p><p>1. Wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto Cable-free smartphone integration is standard across the 2023 Q7 range, so a passenger sitting somewhere other than up front can still connect with the infotainment system if desired.</p><p>2. Hands-Free Tailgate Operation Along with a powered tailgate as standard, every 2023 Q7 includes hands-free operation. Because anyone who needs a 7-seater SUV will probably have their hands full with something.</p><p>3. Virtual Cockpit With the ability to show a range of information, including navigation and maps, this 12.3-inch digital driver information display is a most welcome standard feature in every new Q7 luxury SUV.</p><p>4. Audi Phone Box Available as an option in Premium trim as part of a Convenience package, standard elsewhere, the Audi Phone Box pulls double duty as a phone signal booster and wireless phone charger.</p><p>5. Remote Parking Assist Plus This is a new addition to the top Prestige trims of the 55 TSFI and SQ7 variants. It's a self-parking function for parallel and perpendicular spaces. The driver can choose to stay in the Q7 or jump out and let the system work its magic.</p><p>6. Dual-Pane Side Glass Another new feature this year, available in the 55 TSFI and the SQ7. It's optional in Premium Plus trim and standard in Prestige trim as part of an Executive package that also includes rear shades, heated rear seats, and heated/ventilated front seats. Dual-pane glass helps reduce tire and wind noise.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch: Should you tell your coworkers your salary?

It's turbocharged to produce 261 horsepower, replacing a 248-horsepower unit. We expect it to average around 21 mpg.</p><p>The 55 TSFI version brings a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 developing 329 horsepower.
