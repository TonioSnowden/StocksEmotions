  "text": "<p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/470ce8e8-0e5d-4fe4-8b62-08eb0749da9c\">ran the cryptocurrency exchange as his “personal fiefdom”</a> before it imploded, according to a lawyer working on the bankruptcy, with “substantial amounts of money” spent on items unrelated to the business such as vacation homes in the Bahamas.</p> <p>The company filed for US bankruptcy protection on November 11 as its customers fled and executives discovered billions of dollars in missing funds, exacerbating turmoil in cryptocurrency markets.</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“We have witnessed one of the most abrupt and difficult collapses in the history of corporate America” — James Bromley, partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, in a US court hearing</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Lawyers charged with winding down FTX are attempting to identify a complex web of assets in order to repay creditors. The case has been dogged by allegations of misconduct and major governance failures, as well as a jurisdictional dispute between the US and the Bahamas, where FTX's small inner circle ran the business.</p> <p>According to the company, FTX's overall valuation peaked at $40bn — $32bn for its international business and $8bn for its US operations based on funds raised from venture capital investors.</p> <p>Bromley said the bankruptcy team had found that “substantial funds” were transferred from the exchange to Bankman-Fried's crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, and “substantial amounts of money were spent on things not related to the business”. </p> <p>In a letter to former employees, Bankman-Fried wrote that he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77abea4a-2fe0-4b45-9a95-8ccd48f56098\">“did not realise the full extent of the margin position</a>, nor did I realise the magnitude of the risk posed by a hyper-correlated crash”.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Russia threatens to restrict western Europe gas flows </strong>Gazprom, Russia's state-backed gas pipeline monopoly, accused Ukraine yesterday of taking gas meant for Moldova from lines running through the country and warned that it might <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a112687c-52e3-41f5-ba45-3895669a29e6\">reduce supplies</a> from November 28. Gas prices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/865f2592-2fc2-4be7-aef7-210c5e010f68\">rose in response</a> this morning.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Europe's response:</strong> The EU's plans to cap month-ahead wholesale gas prices at €275 per megawatt hour to avoid a repeat of the summer energy cost surge have come under fire from critics who say it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb2a5ede-714e-4e5e-bbab-485b98ce4f96\">unlikely to ever be used</a>. <em>What do you think of the proposal? </em><a href=\"https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times/what-do-you-think-of-the-eus-plans-to-ca\"><em>Let us know by voting in our poll</em></a><em>.</em> </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Business activity in eurozone shrinks again</strong> Eurozone business activity contracted for the fifth consecutive month but there were signs of improvement in supply chain delays and confidence, according to the new batch of PMI surveys. The UK outlook however remains grim. The US PMI reading later today is anticipated to decline to 50 in November from a reading of 50.4 in October. Peggy Hollinger assesses the mood of European and US CEOs: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ee7f45a-91af-4d1b-b87c-22ed54adda08\">grim, in short</a>.</p> <p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Supreme Court clears way for access to Trump tax records </strong>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for US lawmakers to access <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d519e95-eedd-42bc-bda1-f982dd52fe71\">Donald Trump's tax returns</a>, following numerous attempts by the former president to keep them from a congressional committee investigating his conduct in office. </p> <p><strong>4. China's Covid policy flip-flop stokes frustration</strong> Looser policies and confusing signals from Beijing have stoked a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0e3d8ea-be6c-4c84-b8f9-4ac81dff5fa5\">growing Covid outbreak</a> across China, with swaths of the population once again locked down. Apple iPhone factory workers clashed with police at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e917d76a-62af-4cfc-95d1-aec67cde4e84\">Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou</a> today in what some workers said was a protest over bonuses promised to new workers put into quarantine before being sent to assembly lines.</p> <p><strong>5. Glazers weigh up Manchester United sale </strong>The club's US owners are<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c9a11dc-1414-496a-bff6-ca7bd22e0240\"> searching for outside investments and considering a sale</a>, potentially making it the latest prestigious team in the lucrative Premier League to go on the market in recent months. Yesterday's confirmation came as United announced<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80bb978f-2450-4c04-8643-bc2aaf7d7389\"> Cristiano Ronaldo's departure</a> after the Portuguese star claimed in an interview that the Glazers “don't care about the club”.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Fed minutes </strong>The US Federal Reserve will release the minutes from the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee earlier this month, at which it set a fourth straight interest rate rise of 0.75 percentage points. The minutes are expected to provide insight into when the central bank might <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e21f4164-d2f4-4c37-a42b-f7fd24d1473f\">end its streak of jumbo increases</a> and raise rates at a more “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b0e2db8-fc28-400a-8bac-083bfdaa28bc\">deliberate</a>” pace. </p> <p><strong>Housing </strong>The US commerce department will release data for new home sales, which are expected to have declined to 570,000 in October from 603,000 in September, as would-be home buyers that month contended with mortgage rates above 7 per cent that were unaffordable. </p> <p><strong>Other economic data </strong>Sales of long-lasting goods are expected to have increased by 0.4 per cent for the second month in a row, while&#xa0; initial jobless claims are forecast to have ticked up to 225,000 for the week ending November 19 from 222,000 the preceding week. The University of Michigan will publish the final reading of its consumer sentiment index for November.</p> <p><strong>John Deere </strong>The agricultural machinery manufacturer, an economic bellwether for capital spending, is expected to report a jump in earnings as demand for products such as its iconic green tractors remain high and the company is able to charge higher prices.</p> <p><strong>Ruling on Scottish independence vote </strong>The UK Supreme Court delivers its judgment on whether a second independence referendum can take place without Westminster's approval. The expectation is that the court will rule against the proposal put forward by first minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8b86ed2-7ff7-4323-8fdf-18e4698398e2\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>. The opposition Labour party is putting forward its own proposals on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cbeeb1e-29b4-4294-af15-23ec4a7d4f8a\">devolution</a>.</p> <p><strong>World Cup </strong>Morocco and Croatia go head to head at 1pm local time, while Germany and Japan kick off at 4pm local time. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/fifa-world-cup\">Follow our latest coverage here</a>.

Today, their dominance is part of a broader shift away from bricks and mortar that gives consumer brands powerful new ways to reach shoppers.</p> <p><strong>Has relying on tech made us more stupid? </strong>Dave Lee says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9e3e5c8-e634-4c63-aaf3-6d16987278e7\">leaning too heavily on AI</a> can erode our tolerance for the repetitive actions that help us actually learn.</p> <p><strong>Bolsonaro's party challenges election defeat </strong>The party of Brazil's outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/209cc202-890e-46cd-89f3-66b89e90adfb\">challenged the outcome</a> of the run-off election he narrowly lost last month, calling for the cancellation of ballots from electronic voting machines with alleged malfunctions.</p> <p><strong>‘Immunity debt' is a dangerous concept </strong>There's speculation that pandemic mitigations, including lockdowns, have created a harmful “immunity debt”, with children left vulnerable through a lack of exposure to the usual cut and thrust of viral infections. Anjana Ahuja argues <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0640004d-cc15-481e-90ce-572328305798\">there is no evidence that an individual is worse off</a> for having avoided earlier infection.</p> <p><strong>Macri's possible comeback threatens to divide Argentina opposition </strong><br>Less than a year before Argentina's presidential election and with the economy in chaos, two fierce political rivals — former presidents Mauricio Macri and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner — are both hinting they may run again, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf93deaa-e67f-4fca-a699-c920ee1dffc5\">throwing the race wide open</a>.</p> <h1>Fashion</h1> <p>Clothes are always a costume. And there is no costume more traditional, or more stagy, for people in power than the costume of indifference, such as that worn by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ab3e653-e454-4065-8024-8fa46dc0b9b8\">writes Robert Armstrong.</a></p><p>Source: Darren Dodd, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg 2022 'FirstFT: Bankman-Fried's ‘personal fiefdom'' FT.com 23 November.
