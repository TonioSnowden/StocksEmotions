  "title": "U.S. News:  NFL Cowboys Paid Cheerleaders $2.4 Million  ----  By Andrew Beaton",
  "text": "<p>   The Dallas Cowboys in 2016 paid $2.4 million in settlements to cheerleaders over a 2015 incident in which a top executive was accused of being in their locker room with his cellphone out while they undressed, a person familiar with the matter said. The team confirmed that it investigated the episode and reached a settlement. </p><p>   The allegations were made against Rich Dalrymple, the club's longtime senior vice president for public relations and communications who was a top lieutenant for Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, the person said. </p><p>   In a statement to ESPN, which earlier reported the settlement, Mr. Dalrymple denied wrongdoing. He didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   A spokesman for the team said the allegations were investigated thoroughly at the time and no wrongdoing was found. </p><p>   \"The investigation was handled consistent with best legal and HR practices and the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. If any wrongdoing had been found Rich would have been terminated immediately,\" team spokesman Jim Wilkinson said. \"The cheerleaders are a vital part of the Dallas Cowboys family, and in terms of the settlement, the organization wanted to go above and beyond to ensure the cheerleaders knew that their allegations had been taken extremely seriously and immediately and thoroughly investigated.\" </p><p>   The incident occurred on Sept. 2, 2015, the person familiar with the matter said. The four cheerleaders reported their allegations to the team's human-resources department that day, and one of them reported seeing an arm holding a phone while they undressed. She told the team she ran over and saw Mr. Dalrymple and then he ran out of the room. </p><p>   The team's investigation immediately began with seven interviews: the four cheerleaders, a security guard in the area and two other potential witnesses, according to the person familiar with the matter.The team's legal counsel also interviewed Mr. Dalrymple and seized his iPhone, the person said, while obtaining the password to his iCloud account. A forensics firm studied the phone and found no pictures or videos of the cheerleaders or any evidence that anything had been deleted. </p><p>   Mr. Dalrymple told investigators he was in the room for a matter of seconds before leaving and that he had gone in there to use the bathroom, the person said. </p><p>   Months later, in May 2016, the team and Mr. Dalrymple agreed to the $2.4 million settlement with the cheerleaders in which Mr. Dalrymple denied the allegation of voyeurism. </p><p>   Mr. Dalrymple is no longer an executive for the team after stepping down this month. </p><p></p>",
