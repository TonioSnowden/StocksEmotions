  "text": "<p>Rideshare companies Lyft and Uber are suffering from a famine of drivers and a feast of food delivery rivals.</p> <p>Uber&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b71e009-bb96-46ee-b024-4c574ef41988\">announced a $250m “stimulus” payment</a>&#xa0;to attract and retain drivers last month and should update investors on how that went when it reports earnings after the market closes today. Lyft <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85d2be43-70b1-42a9-a5c9-5f9a12eb00b3\">reported on Tuesday </a>that rider demand had outpaced available drivers since late February. But it predicted the latter would ditch food delivery apps and come back to ride-sharing, claiming they missed the “camaraderie and meaningful interactions” that came with transporting people rather than meals.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd44174a-eee6-406e-86b0-99ed2504ac87\">Tim Bradshaw reports </a>the chiefs of the world's largest food delivery groups, Just Eat Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero, are warning of cut-throat competition caused by a new generation of well-funded instant grocery delivery apps offering heavy discounts. </p> <p>Uber and Deliveroo are eyeing potential alliances with the new apps, with <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504005514/en/Uber-and-Gopuff-Partner-to-Bring-Everyday-Essentials-to-Uber-Eats\">Uber announcing a partnership</a> with Gopuff in the US on Tuesday, where Uber Eats users see nearly every Gopuff “everyday essentials” category on their app.&#xa0;</p> <p>VC firms have been piling into apps that promise to deliver groceries in as little as 10 minutes, thanks to a network of “dark stores” across urban centres in London, Berlin and beyond. “It's received a ton of venture capital dollars in an incredible amount of time,” said Will Shu, Deliveroo's chief executive, adding that the apps' growth was “pretty staggering”.</p> <p>Uber's food delivery chief, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, compared the funding frenzy around 10-minute grocery apps to the earlier spending spree around electric bike and scooter rental services such as Bird, Lime, Voi and Tier. “It feels a lot like the micro mobility craziness we had a year or two ago when there was funding everywhere and there were new players literally every week,” he said.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Trump Facebook ban remains</strong><br>Donald Trump will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa883382-fd2e-4402-867a-7a2bd5ef5d67\">remain blocked from Facebook</a> after a ruling from the company's independent oversight board, but the social network must review within the next six months whether this should become permanent. The former president is <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html\">permanently unable</a> to tweet his displeasure but responded in a statement: “Free Speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth.”</p> <p><strong>2. WhatsApp payments back in Brazil</strong><br>The Facebook-owned messaging app has relaunched a feature in Brazil allowing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c862d5f-e9fd-4503-a8e4-2952a8676b98\">users to send each other money</a>, after an initial attempt was blocked by regulators, and is now pushing to launch business payments in the market as well. </p> <p><strong>3. GM and China tackle chip requirements</strong><br>General Motors has said its most profitable models will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2557f916-a6ed-4053-9998-f3e83586bc71\">get its limited supplies</a> of semiconductors amid the global chip shortage. This week's #techAsia newsletter reports China is implementing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/189f6ac2-d1ef-4c6a-a93c-e0fbda65afa5\">a largely secret strategy</a> for chip self-reliance.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>4. Crypto capers</strong><br>The English <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d376e72c-d70a-4b7b-b195-c1a826714c9a\">Premier League is exploring</a> the fast-growing market for digital collectibles that use non-fungible tokens (NFTs). <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f654556a-12c6-46cc-9e89-3c7fb99f1a57\">Alphaville notes </a>“joke” cryptocurrency dogecoin has doubled in the past week. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cf231db-22d7-4ba9-8cfc-08366f7d3175\">ETF Hub says</a> the early winner in the cryptocurrency ETF service provider contest is&#xa0;BNY Mellon.</p> <p><strong>5. Peloton recalls treadmills</strong><br>The fitness technology group&#xa0;Peloton&#xa0;has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5881bd65-a9d0-4afe-93d7-19a363a51a44\">recalled its treadmills</a> after reports of injuries and one death involving the machines, sending shares in the company to a seven-month low.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Steinway's Spirio R</h2> <p>From Lang Lang to Arthur Rubinstein, <a href=\"https://steinway.co.uk/pianos/spirio-r/\">Steinway's Spirio R </a>technology reproduces their performances on its self-playing grand piano, starting from £127,000.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aed155f1-8b00-467d-992c-9a65bd5b19a8\">As Jonathan Margolis explains,</a> streamed video of the original performance can also be played on a TV nearby. Spirio R picks up&#xa0;the&#xa0;subtleties&#xa0;of every key press — the&#xa0;system&#xa0;can detect 1,024 “velocity steps” — so&#xa0;the auto-Lang Lang that plays&#xa0;in&#xa0;your home is&#xa0;to all intents and&#xa0;purposes him. The system is&#xa0;more sophisticated than a 2015&#xa0;version. For instance, you can&#xa0;record your own work&#xa0;and edit it on the dedicated iPad that comes with a Spirio R piano, before posting the polished piece on social media.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Dark store shadow over food delivery' FT.com 5 May.
