  "text": "<p>Nikkei added that COVID-19 disruptions have made it difficult for Apple and its suppliers to travel back and forth to confirm the specifications firsthand.</p><p>Bloomberg News separately confirmed the delay, noting the new device is expected to have a bigger, more complex screen and faster processor. Citing a source familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the production halt will likely result in shipping delays and a reduced supply once it's available to customers.</p><p>Based on past releases, the new Watch is expected to be announced at Apple's September product event, and will likely go on sale before the end of the year.</p><p>In July, Apple reported that revenue for its wearables and accessories unit grew by about 11% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter, to about $8.78 billion.</p><p>Apple shares AAPL fell slightly Tuesday, and are up 14% year to date, compared to the S&amp;P 500's SPX 20% gain in 2021.</p>",
