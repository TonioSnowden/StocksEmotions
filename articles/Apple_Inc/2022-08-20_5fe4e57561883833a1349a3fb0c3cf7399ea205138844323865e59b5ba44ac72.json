  "text": "<p>Beyond the obvious, like talky podcasts or new music, try starting your commute by simply looking around. I like to note any backpacks I've never seen before, what headphones people are using -- Apple AirPods seem to be in decline while beefier noise cancellers are on the rise -- and all the weird sneakers people are wearing.</p><p>If I'm lucky, that gets me through the first 10 minutes. Then I have to get creative. At the suggestion of my colleague, Off Duty art director Marlene Szczesny, I recently downloaded a few apps that let me make actual art out of random photos in my camera roll. Union ($6 a month) lets you superimpose anything you have downloaded (or pulled from its very large library) to make funny compositions and collages. I combined a photo of my friend's Corgi with one of an islet I saw in the Azores. It looks like Dr. Doom (yes, that is his government name) is about to lick the island. Ms. Szczesny also suggests VideoLeap ($10 a month) for adding fun filters, music and text to your videos or WordFoto ($2) for splicing short word phrases artfully into your pictures.</p><p>When I think I'll have more energy, I pack a set of wired headphones and one of Teenage Engineering's Pocket Operators like the PO-33 K.O! (teenage.engineering, $99). These calculator-shaped doohickeys are extremely powerful music-making machines. You can use their built-in microphones to record random noises around you, then use the buttons and knobs to manipulate and play them back as pleasant loops. After watching a couple of people use it on YouTube, I found myself creating endless goofy beats. My favorite involved several different chops of a classic MTA safety announcement, \"Stand clear of the closing doors, please.\"</p><p>If you want to do something slightly more productive, the commute can be a good time to read shorter things, like magazine or (cough) newspaper stories. I use the app Pocket to save stories I want to read later. I also use the service Pocket to Kindle (p2k.co) to get downloaded versions of these sent to my e-reader (and the free Kindle app on my iPhone) to read offline. If this is your plan, though, it's probably a good idea to join the New Yorkers investing in sound-isolating earpieces. Those sax players are loud!</p><p>---</p><p>Having a life problem only a new gadget can solve? Email us: fixer@wsj.com</p>",
