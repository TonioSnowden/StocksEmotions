  "text": "<p>Social mobility is a vexed and recurring topic of British conversation. In the publishing world, it has recently triggered a wave of books by economists and social scientists taking an analytical approach to the problem. <em>Snakes &amp; Ladders</em>, Selina Todd's new study, adds to our understanding because of the richness of its historical landscape. </p> <p>Todd, a professor of modern history at Oxford university, tracks successive British generations with a humane focus on how individuals took their opportunities and also how obstacles were put in their way — sometimes in vivid and painful detail. </p> <p>She offers a fascinating chapter on the rise of clerks, key to understanding HG Wells's frustrated Mr Polly or EM Forster's doomed Leonard Bast. Todd also shows how the “eleven plus” grammar school entrance exam was captured by the middle classes. The immigrant experience, often missing from conventional analysis, gets proper attention here — in particular the evidence of immigrants moving down to lower status occupations than those they had left behind. </p> <p>Elsewhere Todd points out the tendency, even now, to analyse social mobility through progression in male earnings. She shows how the marriage rule, requiring women to give up a job after they got married, was not some ancient pernicious tradition: it was deliberately extended during the first half of the 20th century to try to reserve prestigious well-paid jobs for men. </p> <p>The book also offers a subtle and sensitive account of the complex pressures on someone from the working class on the journey to the middle class. To what extent should they conform? Were they betraying their origins? Fulfilling the dreams of parents could also mean being cut off from them. </p> <p>This rich and well-observed historical account is however marred by surprisingly crude political assumptions: Labour are the good guys and Conservatives are the enemy. Todd begins one chapter simply asserting: “The ‘golden age' of social mobility ended abruptly thanks to Margaret Thatcher's election as Conservative prime minister in 1979.” Historians do have their political views and she is entitled to hers. But it matters here because it means she does not really cover the policy dilemmas inherent in promoting social mobility. It is so much easier when things get tricky just to turn to the assumption that the malign power of Conservatives explains what went wrong. </p> <p>The shrinking of manufacturing industry and the closure of coal mines undermined a classic route into stable, well-paid, skilled manual jobs. It has left behind parts of the country whose core industries have disappeared or been overtaken in Asia. But just blaming Thatcher enables Todd conveniently to assume there was some benign alternative that would have stopped that happening. It is a contrast with, for example, Amy Goldstein's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3ec55b0-7dd4-11e7-9108-edda0bcbc928\"><em>Janesville</em></a>, a powerful account of what the closure of a GM factory meant for the prospects of an entire community but which does not assume it only happened because President Ronald Reagan was wrong. </p> <p>Todd is right that income inequality grew during the 1980s. But it was also a decade when living standards surged, including for the less affluent half of the population. And mobility may be promoted by signalling that there is more to be earned in a different job in a different place. These are painful decisions for people and difficult for policymakers too but the author does not analyse the dilemma because it requires analysis of real trade-offs. And behind all this is the power of the family. The desire of parents to do the best for their children is natural, admirable and, when it means passing on power and wealth, one of the biggest perpetuators of social privilege. </p> <p>The doyen of social mobility research, John Goldthorpe, makes a crucial distinction. Absolute social mobility can increase because of the changes in the structure of the economy — more white-collar jobs for example. Relative social mobility improves when people from less advantaged backgrounds do better regardless of such changes in the structure of the economy. Goldthorpe has shown how hard it is to boost relative social mobility and how many of the tools we favour, including greater access to education, do not necessarily help as much as we might hope. </p> <p>I personally believe that the most effective tool we have now is widening access to university. But Goldthorpe's is a salutary message and Todd has some very effective swipes at the facile solutions of what she calls the social mobility industry. They often assume that the problem is that people from less affluent backgrounds lack aspiration when she rightly argues that they too have their ambitions but it is much harder to fulfil them. </p> <p>Todd ends with policy proposals which are more Corbyn than Blair and demand above all a much bigger public sector. But if the middle classes remain as astute in looking after the interests of their children as they were through the last century she might find that this too does not deliver what she hopes. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1784740810/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1784740810&amp;linkId=8186defb05d709b49e5bd174ad651e6f\"><strong>Snakes &amp; Ladders</strong></a><strong>: The Great British Social Mobility Myth</strong>, by Selina Todd, <em>Chatto &amp; Windus, RRP£25, 448 pages</em> </p> <p><em>David Willetts is president of the Resolution Foundation and author of A University Education (Oxford University Press)</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
