  "text": "<p>A 21-year-old student at the University of California San Diego allegedly commandeered the cell phone accounts of at least 40 people to plunder their cryptocurrency wallets, prosecutors said.</p><p>Richard Yuan Li, of Hercules, Calif., is accused of operating what is called a SIM-swap scam from his dorm room at Argo Hall. A SIM card — or subscriber identity module — is the chip inside a phone that connects a phone with its number and account.&#xa0;</p><p>They say Li conspired with a cell phone company employee to have unsuspecting victims' SIMs and cell-phone accounts transferred to one contained in a stolen iPhone he possessed.</p><p>Once Li had gained access to the victims' accounts, prosecutors say he and other unnamed conspirators would use the phone's two-factor authentication credentials to reset passwords and gain access to the victims' email, bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.</p><p>In at least one case, prosecutors say Li stole a significant amount of a New Orleans doctor's cryptocurrency and then tried to blackmail him into handing over an additional $640,000 worth of bitcoin by threatening to share nude photos taken from the doctor's email with people he knew, according to court filings.</p><p>Federal prosecutors in Louisiana say that in total, Li activated at least 40 numbers on his iPhone AAPL AAPL between July and December, 2018.</p><p>Li's lawyer, Bruce Ashley, said his client was a “bright and very earnest young man,” who had good academic records, but declined to comment on the allegations against him.</p><p>Li was initially charged in the scam in June 2020, but the case was recently expanded as prosecutors determined that he had allegedly scammed far more victims than initially thought.</p><p>In February, prosecutors charged cell phone company employee Stephen Daniel Defiore, 36, of Brandon, Fla. for allegedly transferring control of victim accounts to Li in exchange for $500 a day. The cell phone company wasn't identified.</p><p>If convicted, Li&#xa0;faces a maximum term of 20 years in prison.</p><p>A lawyer for Defiore declined to comment.</p><p>Apple was not immediately available for comment.</p>",
