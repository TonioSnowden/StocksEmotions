U.S. stocks had rallied for three straight sessions before Wednesday's wipeout, which was the worst post-election day performance for the major U.S. indexes on a percentage-point basis since 2012.</p><p>\"What's important about all this is we had some very important events this week and both played out in a favorable way for markets,\" Hogan added, a reference to both the inflation data and the expectation that Republicans will control the House once all the votes are tallied from Tuesday's midterms.</p><p>Shortly after the data were released, the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos reportedthat the October report \"is likely to keep the Fed on track to approve a 50-basis-point interest-rate increase next month.\"</p><p>Fed funds futures traders were pricing in higher than 80% of a 50 basis point rate hike in December, compared with below 60% odds one day earlier, compared with the CME's FedWatch tool.</p><p>Several senior Federal Reserve officials delivered public remarks on Thursday, including Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who said the Fed will slow down the pace of interest rate hikes in the coming months.

CRM and Microsoft Corp. MSFT All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors were also trading in the green, with at least half a dozen sectors on track for their biggest one-day gain since April 2020.</p><p>Investors will also need to digest the November CPI report, due early next month, before the Federal Reserve meets again to decide the size of the next rate hike.</p><p>In other markets, Bitcoin BTCUSD was recovering some ground early Thursday after falling to its lowest level since 2020 this week on expectations that FTX and its related companies might be headed for insolvency.
