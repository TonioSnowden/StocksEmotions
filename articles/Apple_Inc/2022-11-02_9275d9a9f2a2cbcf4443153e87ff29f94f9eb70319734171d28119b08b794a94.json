  "title": "World News:  Hong Kong Editors  Are Tried for Sedition  ----  By Selina Cheng",
  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- Two former editors of a Hong Kong news outlet went on trial for sedition over articles prosecutors say promoted pro-democracy activists and attacked the government, a key case in authorities' national security crackdown on the city's once relatively free press. </p><p>   Two top editors for the now-defunct online news website Stand News, Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam Shiu-tung, were arrested in December after hundreds of national security police raided their newsroom. The duo, who have been detained for almost a year, have pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiring to publish or reproduce seditious publications. </p><p>   If convicted, the editors could face up to two years in prison. </p><p>   The charges were brought under the city's British colonial-era laws against sedition, rather than the National Security Law imposed by China in June 2020 to stifle pro-democracy voices that had fueled mass unrest in the city. Authorities have increasingly used sedition laws to prosecute opponents. </p><p>   In a 53-page opening statement read out in court on Tuesday, prosecutors alleged that Stand News' former editor in chief, Mr. Chung, and acting editor in chief, Mr. Lam, conspired together to publish 17 seditious articles between July 2020 and December last year. They included interviews with high-profile pro-democracy activists Nathan Law and former lawmaker Ted Hui, who are both living in exile, as well as opinion articles. The articles were published with the intention to incite hatred and contempt toward the city's authorities, prosecutors said. </p><p>   Defense lawyer Audrey Eu argued on Monday that the charges were unconstitutional and that the media has a duty as the fourth estate to report. If someone \"reported on a murderer [that] does not mean he agreed with his actions,\" she said. \"If being a little critical is a crime, then the media would have nothing to do.\" </p><p>   Stand News was a small online news outlet that came to prominence in 2019, when its constant video live streams and close coverage of the antigovernment protests became hugely popular in Hong Kong, drawing to it hundreds of thousands of viewers and readers. </p><p>   The site shut its operation hours after it became the second newsroom raided by national security police. That operation came six months after pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily was raided and executives at the paper were arrested on national security charges that year. Its founder, Jimmy Lai, is currently in jail, awaiting trial for allegedly conspiring to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security. He denies the charge. </p><p>   Prosecutors on Tuesday said Stand News deleted some of the articles from its website months before charges were issued, indicating the editors knew these ran the risk of violating the law. </p><p>   Prosecutors said the activists had illegally lobbied foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong, and the interviews promoted them as people \"who fought for Hong Kong's core values such as freedom and human rights out of their own conscience.\" </p><p></p>",
