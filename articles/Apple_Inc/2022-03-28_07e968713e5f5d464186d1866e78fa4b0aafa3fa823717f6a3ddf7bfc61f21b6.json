  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, oil prices declined as money managers worried lockdowns in China would sap demand. </p><p>Fed officials have recently signaled openness to the central bank doing half-percentage-point interest rate increases if the economy's outlook calls for it, rather than the more customary quarter-percentage-point changes. This has led economists and investors to re-evaluate how quickly they expect interest rates to climb. </p><p>Some investors have begun selling holdings of government bonds in anticipation. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note continued a recent ascent, climbing to 2.510% Monday from 2.491% Friday, when it notched its highest level in almost three years. Yields rise when prices fall. </p><p>Yields on short- and medium-term Treasurys, which are most responsive to Fed policy, were up more than those on longer-term bonds.</p><p>The yield on the two-year Treasury note stood at 2.397% Monday, putting it about 0.11 percentage point away from the 10-year note's level. An inversion where the two-year note yields more than the 10-year is historically tracked by investors as a predictorof recession. </p><p>Treasury yields set a floor on interest rates across the economy and are a key input in financial models investors use to value stocks and other investments. Rising yields typically weigh on tech stocks in particular, because the ability to get higher risk-free returns from bonds tends to make investors less interested in companies that are valued for their more distant earnings potential.</p><p>In premarket trading, shares of Apple fell 1.4% and Twitter edged 1% lower. </p><p>Oil prices fell after Shanghai imposed stringent pandemic restrictions that could weaken energy demand. Brent-crude futures, the international benchmark, declined 3.6% to $113.14 a barrel. Concerns over how Russia's war with Ukraine will disrupt energy production has kept oil prices elevated about $100 a barrel in recent weeks. Heightened prices have also bolstered concerns that consumers will have less money to spend on nonessential items, weighing on growth. </p><p>\"The market at the moment is assuming that [higher energy prices] will moderate the pace of growth and central banks will tighten,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The degree to which central banks may increase interest rates though is likely to depend on global growth and whether higher prices for energy and oil require lower rates to cushion growth, he added.</p><p>Federal-funds futures—derivatives used by traders to bet on the path of interest rates—show that investors have ramped up bets on a 50-basis-point rate increase at the Fed's May meeting since last week. </p><p>Russia's benchmark MOEX index edged down 1.8% Monday in a shortened session as Moscow allowed all Russian shares to trade. Foreigners remain barred from selling shares, helping underpin the benchmark's level. </p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.6%. Shares of Barclays declined 2.8% after the British bank said it expects a loss of £450 million, equivalent to $593.1 million, from rescission losses after determining that its structured note issuance exceeded the registered amount over the period of a year, giving rise to the right of rescission among purchasers. </p><p>Major indexes in Asia closed with mixed performance. China's Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%. South Korea's Kospi was flat, and Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Bond Yields Near Three-Year Highs, Weighing on Stock Futures</p>",
