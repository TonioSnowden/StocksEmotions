  "text": "<p>Joel Coen alone directs the stark and showy <em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em>. With brother Ethan on a break, he has opted for high-end source material. It makes for the kind of project a Coen brothers movie might have once had smirky fun with. What would the hard-boiled studio execs of <em>Barton Fink</em> and <em>Hail, Caesar!</em> think of the director of so much zippy irreverence tackling Shakespeare with the fractionally grand credit, “Written for the screen by Joel Coen”?<br><br>Delivering his words are Frances McDormand as Lady Macbeth and Denzel Washington as a grey-bearded Macbeth with a warm, tobacco chuckle. Such is the soul to be damned in a staging less furious than flawlessly designed. The movie is black and white and then some, all pristine snow and abyss. Filthy clouds pass over a moon that becomes a spotlight. We strip back to the eerie rudiments of early cinema, <em>The Cabinet of Dr Caligari</em> at Inverness Castle. The mood inside is vivid, corridors haunted by shadows, windows battered by tree limbs.<br><br>A film lover like Joel Coen will know that making <em>Macbeth</em> as expressionist horror was a trick already played on screen by Orson Welles in 1948. A cynic might also see a brand-name director indulging their art on the buck of a backer, Apple, that needs movie credibility by association. Both things are true. Still, the aesthetic is a perfect fit for the mood of dread and things askew. A marvel in itself as well. As the castle broods under the cold stars, the film is a celebration of cinema every bit as rich as Steven Spielberg's recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb9fc43-0bd8-451d-a405-f55b074d2511\"><em>West Side Story</em></a>.</p> <p>The play does less well. The casting of Washington and McDormand, both in their sixties, brings a sense of stifled ambition and generational power grab. But the actual performances — award-winners for sure — feel limited, big on the soliloquies, ho-hum otherwise. Do they really seem like murderers? They do not. The kick is in the mere novelty of hearing movie stars deliver the speeches, like watching a cat skateboard. </p> <p>The real coup comes elsewhere, Kathryn Hunter astonishing as all three witches. A <em>sui generis</em> physical performer, limbs contorted, speaking in guttural singsong: her one-woman Weird Sisters demand to be seen. She perches high above Washington's Macbeth and Coen's too, up with the crows and the heavens.</p> <p>★★★☆☆<br><br><em>In cinemas from December 26 and on Apple TV Plus from January 14</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand star in a brooding The Tragedy of Macbeth' FT.com 22 December.
