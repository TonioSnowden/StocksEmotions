  "text": "<p>Delta Air Lines Inc.</p><p>Delta is flying high but faces new turbulence. It, along with other carriers, is grappling with surging costs, staffing and supply challenges during a busy summer season. Over the bustling Memorial Day weekend, Delta accounted for around half of all U.S. flight cancellations. On Wednesday it raised its second-quarter sales guidance, forecasting revenue will return to prepandemic levels on the back of higher demand and prices, as travelers resume trips that may have been put on hold because of Covid-19. Delta shares fell 5.2% Wednesday.</p><p>Meta Platforms Inc.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg is logging out at Meta. Ms. Sandberg on Wednesday said she would leave her role as chief operating officer of the Facebook parent, ending her tenure as longtime lieutenant to Mark Zuckerberg that made her one of the most prominent women in business. The Wall Street Journal reported that Ms. Sandberg's surprise departure was a culmination of years of burnout that dovetailed with a company investigation into her activities. Ms. Sandberg will continue as a member of Meta's board, and current Chief Growth Officer Javier Olivan will take over as COO when she leaves. Meta shares lost 2.6% Wednesday.</p><p>Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Silicon Valley has long resisted organized labor, but that is changing at one tech giant. Microsoft said it is open to working with unions that want to organize within its workforce. President Brad Smith said in a blog post that Microsoft wouldn't interfere with employees' right to form or join unions and would collaborate with workers if they do choose to unionize. This comes after a wave of organization efforts hit Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., as well as other companies. Microsoft is working to close its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc., which also faces a unionization push. Microsoft shares decreased 1.7% Friday.</p><p>Ford Motor Co.</p><p>Ford is revving up hiring and production. The auto maker said it would create 6,200 union manufacturing jobs and invest $3.7 billion into plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. The plans come as Ford looks to expand vehicle production and prepare for the next round of negotiations with the United Auto Workers union set for 2023. As part of the workforce expansion, the auto maker said it plans to convert 3,000 temporary workers to full time, and all hourly employees will receive healthcare benefits on their first day of work. Ford shares gained 2.5% Thursday.</p><p>Hormel Foods Corp.</p><p>Bird flu is ruffling Hormel. The Spam maker said it expects the U.S. avian influenza outbreak to weigh on its turkey flocks and the poultry industry in coming months. The outbreak, which has led to the death of nearly 40 million birds in the U.S., may push elevated meat prices even higher. Hormel reported higher sales and profit in its second quarter, with its Jennie-O turkey brand posting a 387% rise in profit, but cut the high end of its earnings outlook for the year as it faces the impact of the bird flu, rising costs and Covid-19 restrictions in China. Hormel shares lost 5.2% Thursday.</p><p>Pfizer Inc.</p><p>Covid-19 shots may soon be cleared for children under 5 years old. Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE on Wednesday asked the Food and Drug Administration to authorize three doses of their vaccine for the young age group. FDA clearance could come before the end of the month. The companies said last month that three doses of the shot were 80% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 and generated a robust immune response in children ages 6 months to 5 years old. If the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signs off, the last remaining group of Americans—roughly 19 million young children—would receive vaccine access. Pfizer shares added 0.6% Thursday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Unilever, Meta, Microsoft: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
