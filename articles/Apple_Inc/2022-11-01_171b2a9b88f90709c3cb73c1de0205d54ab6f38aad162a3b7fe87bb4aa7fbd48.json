  "title": "The boldly-styled 2023 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid looks pretty cool and averages a sweet 54 mpg; 2023 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid review: Impressive mileage, sharp styling, roomy trunk",
  "text": "<p>* Roomy interior</p><p>* Sharp exterior</p><p>Cons</p><p>* Big price gap between the two trims</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* No significant changes</p><p>The 2023 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid is an extremely fuel-efficient compact sedan. Its starting price is $24,400.</p><p>With the same bold styling as the rest of the Elantra compact sedan range, the 2023 Hyundai HYMTF Elantra Hybrid factors in the ability to make a gallon of gas go for 56 miles on the highway. That's better than the Toyota TM Prius.</p><p>Yet the Elantra Hybrid is also exceptionally spacious for its class, with plenty of standard safety features. It offers some great technology as well, like dual 10.25-inch screens and a smartphone key app. And the Elantra has scored well in crash-test programs.</p><p>The regular, non-hybrid 2023 Elantra is reviewed separately.</p><p>2023 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid pricing</p><p>There are just two trims in the 2023 Elantra Hybrid lineup. Blue has a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $24,400, plus a destination charge. Limited comes in at $29,000.</p><p>The only real competitors in the hybrid-powered compact sedan category are the Toyota Corolla Hybrid and the new-for-2023 Honda Civic Hybrid (succeeding the Insight, a vehicle based on the previous-generation Civic platform). The Toyota also starts at around $24K, and the Honda HMC shouldn't be wildly different.</p><p>Before buying a new Elantra Hybrid sedan, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for theirs. We would expect the Corolla Hybrid and Civic Hybrid to retain their values better than the Elantra Hybrid, but changes in fuel prices could easily see all three cars becoming much sought after.</p><p>Driving the 2023 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid</p><p>People choosing to buy a new hybrid car are not usually speed freaks, which is just as well because the two 2023 Elantra Hybrid variants are among the heaviest of the wider Elantra range.</p><p>At least the electric motor and combustion engine work to provide a pleasant 195 lb-ft of torque, which will make its presence felt (in a good way) when accelerating away from a standstill.</p><p>Instead of a slow-witted continuously variable transmission, Hyundai has been kind enough to install a 6-speed dual-clutch automated transmission, whose responses are nice and crisp.</p><p>The main story for this aspect of the 2023 Elantra Hybrid is its fuel economy. The Blue trim is the thriftiest with gasoline, able to achieve 56 mpg on the highway and averaging around 54 mpg. The Limited trim can still manage 52 mpg on highway stretches and a perfectly respectable 50 mpg in combined city/highway driving.</p><p>Another nice inclusion is the multi-link rear suspension, which replaces the cheaper torsion beam setup of some combustion-only Elantra versions. This allows a finer tuning of the suspension to balance comfort with control.</p><p>You might like: 10 cars that are being discontinued this year (and there could be bargains here)</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>As well as an interior design that complements the car's assertive exterior, the cabin of the 2023 Elantra Hybrid is remarkably spacious. Although considered a compact sedan, this has accommodations comparable to a midsize model.</p><p>Rear legroom measures 38 inches, the same as the Toyota Camry. The Blue version has one-piece folding rear seats, while the Limited trim's rear seats split 60/40. By locating the hybrid battery under the rear seats, it means the Elantra Hybrid didn't have to compromise with trunk space, packing the same 14.2 cubic feet as its combustion-only counterparts.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The one small change in the 2023 Elantra Hybrid is that the taillights go from being LED-only to a combination of LED and bulb, which seems like a backward step and is a cost-cutting move that should save the company maybe a dollar or two.</p><p>The rest of the car doesn't make any special effort to send a \"this is a hybrid\" message to the world, but it does make a special effort to look really (arguably) cool. Gone are the days when Hyundai cars would fade into the general blur of traffic.</p><p>Also see: Finally, new car inventory is up; what it means for car shoppers</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>Twin 10.25-inch displays One for driver information, the other for the infotainment system. They add to the high-tech flavor of the Limited model and suit the sparse interior design. Just one thing — this setup isn't compatible with wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, so bring a cable along for the ride.</p><p>Hyundai Digital Key Another feature in the Limited model, The Hyundai Digital Key allows several users to access one 2023 Elantra Hybrid using a smartphone app to unlock/lock and start the vehicle. At the moment, it's limited (pardon the pun) to Android phones. Apple iPhone owners can use a keycard employing near-field communications (NFC) technology.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch: 7 ways save a bundle on your tax bill — and position yourself for future savings</p><p>Standard features</p><p>Starting with Blue trim, the 2023 Elantra Hybrid sedan has 16-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry/start, cloth upholstery, and dual-zone automatic climate control.</p><p>Safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assistance, automatic high beams, lane-following assistance, and Safe Exit Warning.</p><p>The infotainment system in this Blue model includes an 8-inch touchscreen, wireless Apple AAPL CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration, two USB ports, satellite radio, Bluetooth, and six speakers.</p><p>Factory options</p><p>In the absence of many actual extras — the most expensive addition to the Blue trim is a self-dimming rearview mirror with a garage door opener — potential buyers of a new Elantra Hybrid have the option of choosing the Limited version.</p><p>This pricier trim comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, sunroof, heated side mirrors, power-adjustable driver's seat with memory settings for this and the side mirrors, heated/ventilated front seats, leather seating surfaces, leather-wrapped steering wheel, self-dimming rearview mirror, ambient LED cabin lighting, and the Hyundai Digital Key.</p><p>Enhanced safety systems include cyclist detection and junction assistance, rear parking sensors with automatic reverse braking, Highway Driving Assist, and adaptive cruise control.</p><p>In the technology and entertainment department, Limited trim adds wireless charging, dual 10.25-inch displays, navigation, and an 8-speaker Bose audio system.</p><p>Don't miss: Car quality is slipping: These are the brands with the most and least complaints, study finds</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>The combination of an electric motor powered by a lithium-ion polymer battery and a naturally aspirated (no turbos or anything) 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine gives the 2023 Elantra Hybrid a total of 139 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque.</p><p>This goes solely to the front wheels (all-wheel drive is not available) through a 6-speed automated transmission. Regular gasoline is fine.</p><p>1.6-liter inline-4/permanent magnet synchronous electric motor 139 total horsepower 195 lb-ft of total torque EPA city/highway fuel economy: 53/56 mpg (Blue), 49/52 mpg (Limited)</p><p>KBB's car review methodology .</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com .</p><p>The boldly-styled 2023 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid looks pretty cool and averages a sweet 54 mpg</p>",
