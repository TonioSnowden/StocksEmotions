  "title": "A Salt Lake City Couple Built a Second Home Next Door. Soon It Became Their First. Cynthia Strike Petrow and George Petrow created a modern house next to the property where Ms. Petrow grew up to vacation and host family. Now they're living in it full time",
  "text": "<p>In 2015, Ms. Petrow and her husband, George Petrow, a 69-year-old retired attorney, bought the property next door for $650,000. Ms. Petrow says they thought it would be a second homeâ€”a place to vacation and see family but with their own space, and they liked the idea of expanding into a compound. But after tearing down the ranch in 2020 and building a new, four-bedroom, five-bathroom modern house for around $3.85 million, she says they decided to move there full time.</p><p>The building process started in 2018, when Mr. Petrow called Anne Mooney, a principal at Sparano + Mooney Architecture, based in Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He says he saw photos in The Wall Street Journal of a house the firm had designedand wanted something similar.</p><p>Although she was very busy at the time, Ms. Mooney says she couldn't refuse when Mr. Petrow told her the address of the property: it was on the same street where she grew up. It turns out Ms. Mooney and Ms. Petrow had lived there at the same period when they were young, but they didn't know each other. \"I understood the street, its traffic patterns, the seasonality and its steepness,\" says Ms. Mooney.</p><p>Ms. Petrow and her siblings had renovated their childhood home in 2012 for around $250,000, so the couple temporarily moved in there in 2019, allowing them to supervise construction next door. \"They couldn't run and hide,\" says Ms. Petrow about the builders.</p><p>Ms. Mooney says the overarching design goal for the new modern house was to create the feeling of a house floating above the landscape. To that end, there is a heavy, recessed base, placing the house a foot higher than the lawn. The architects put a water fountain surrounded by smooth, rolled lava rock under a partially covered courtyard between the front of the house and the street.</p><p>The exterior wall is cut into fin-like structures that give a modern take on Greek columns that create privacy but still allow light into the home. The fins, and an oval opening in the courtyard roof that reveals the sky, are borrowed elements from classical architecture, says Nate King, an architect with Sparano + Mooney who also worked on the project. It was a nod to Ms. Petrow's grandparents, who emigrated from Greece to Utah.</p><p>The front door to the house also references Ms. Petrow's ancestry: it is made from copper because her grandfather owned a general store at an area copper mine, says Ms. Petrow. The garage has the same shape as that of the house next door but there are no doors visible. Instead, it appears to be a windowless stone wall.</p><p>Inside the house, the placement and proportions of the walls were largely designed around Mr. Petrow's art collection, much of which is photography. The collection's centerpiece, placed on the wall of the entryway directly opposite the front courtyard, is a large-format piece by Korean photographer Atta Kim of a street in downtown New York City, made by leaving his lens open for a number of hours.</p><p>An office, visible from the courtyard outside, can be closed off from the rest of the house with pocket doors. Down the hall is the main bedroom, which faces the back of the home and has views of the Wasatch Mountains.</p><p>similar stories</p><p>* A Lake House Is Nice.

But in the End, 'It's Exactly What We Wanted.'</p><p>On the other side of the house is the main living space, which also has panoramic views of the mountains and the valley below, and includes an open living room, dining room and kitchen. The kitchen also closes off from the rest of the house with pocket doors. Overhangs on the porch outside the main living space are calculated to optimize the sun and shade in winter and summer.</p><p>Downstairs is the more informal space, with a family room filled by a semicircular blue velvet sofa, a wine cellar with a glass wall, and three bedrooms and three bathrooms, one for each of the Petrows' adult children, ages 30-37.</p><p>Glass doors open out to a patio and a rectangular swimming pool designed to fit with the geometry of the site. Stairs lead from the pool to the house next door, so when Ms. Petrow's siblings and their families are there, they can easily move back and forth between the homes. They can converse between homes from upper decks that are the same height.</p><p>The Petrows, who met when Mr. Petrow was a law student at the University of Utah and Ms. Petrow was working for a U.S. senator for Utah, initially thought the new Salt Lake City house they were building would be a second home. They changed their mind as the design evolved and they realized they wanted to live there full time. When they bought the property, they were living in London, where they had moved in 2012 from Greenwich, Conn., after Mr. Petrow's law firm transferred him there from the New York office.</p><p>The couple was drawn to the views and the reconnection with friends and family, says Ms. Petrow. It isn't as exciting a place to live as New York or London, she says, but it is a good place to return. \"We spend a lot of time watching the weather come in.\" says Mr. Petrow with a smile.</p><p>Write to Nancy Keates at Nancy.Keates@wsj.com</p><p>A Salt Lake City Couple Built a Second Home Next Door.
