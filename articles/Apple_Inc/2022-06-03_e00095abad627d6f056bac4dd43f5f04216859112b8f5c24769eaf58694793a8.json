  "text": "<p>Ms. Sandberg's departure comes less than a year after the exit of former ad sales head Carolyn Everson, another leader with strong ties on Madison Avenue.</p><p>Meta is reckoning with a renewed focus on user privacy -- accelerated by a change Apple Inc. made in its platforms -- that is undermining its advantages in the ad marketplace and slowing the company's growth. Meanwhile, many marketers are pushing Meta to do more to control objectionable content such as hate speech and misinformation. And the company faces a fearsome competitor in TikTok.</p><p>\"The No. 1 task for Meta with the departure of excellent leaders such as Carolyn Everson and Sheryl Sandberg is to find someone who is completely focused on the advertising community and recognizes the enormous opportunity that they have to restore credibility in the platform,\" said Lou Paskalis, a former marketing executive at Bank of America.</p><p>Facebook offered reassurances to advertising agencies in a memo on Wednesday. \"We remain confident in the road ahead and committed to offering the best ways to grow your business through a meaningful, durable connection with your customers -- right now, and into the metaverse tomorrow,\" the memo said.</p><p>Meta has said it won't reassign Ms. Sandberg's exact role, but that veteran executive Javier Olivan will be the new chief operating officer, responsible for ad and business products, marketing and other areas. Ms. Sandberg will remain on Facebook's board.</p><p>In an email to top ad executives to inform them about her departure, Ms. Sandberg said, \"One of the highlights of my time with Meta has been getting to know partners like you,\" according to a copy viewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"You've shared invaluable, sometimes tough, feedback along the way -- pushing us and making us better,\" she wrote.</p><p>A key figure to watch is Meta's chief business officer, Marne Levine, ad executives said. Ms. Levine has been making the rounds with brands and agencies but has yet to build the strong relationships that Ms. Everson and Ms. Sandberg have, some ad buyers said.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg, who joined Facebook in 2008, has played a variety of roles in building up its ad business. She was an internal evangelist, a pitchwoman to Madison Avenue and a crisis manager.</p><p>Though her interactions with marketers and agencies have become less frequent in recent years, ad executives said she left a lasting impact on the online advertising world.</p><p>\"She was the catalyst for getting marketers to go more and more digital,\" said Joe Tripodi, a former chief marketing officer for brands such as Coca-Cola, Subway and Allstate.</p><p>Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delegated the monetization of Facebook's huge user base mostly to Ms. Sandberg. She persuaded him to become more aggressive around a decade ago in capitalizing on the vast amounts of user data Facebook captured on its own platform and from sites across the web.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ms. Sandberg preached the benefits of digital advertising to chief marketing officers and persuaded them to move money to Facebook. She was also known to pitch chief executives and board members, according to marketing and agency executives.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg, who earlier had a career in politics as the chief of staff to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, went to great lengths to woo brands and develop relationships at every turn, from ski trips to meetings at industry festivals. Big marketers were sometimes dinner guests at Ms. Sandberg's home.</p><p>Sam Bloom, chief executive of Dallas-based digital ad agency Camelot Strategic Marketing &amp; Media, said after his brother-in-law died, Ms. Sandberg sent his widow, a senior marketing executive, a signed copy of her book \"Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy,\" about Ms. Sandberg's own grief after losing her husband.</p><p>In recent years, Ms. Everson had more face time with advertisers and was seen by many as their go-to person, ad executives said.</p><p>---</p><p>Patrick Coffee contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
