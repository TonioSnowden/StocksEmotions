  "title": "Google  Sued by  States for  App Store  Practices  ---  Latest legal challenge  against search giant  says it has monopoly  over phone downloads  ----  By Ryan Tracy and Tripp Mickle",
  "text": "<p>   Three dozen states and the District of Columbia filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.'s Google Wednesday, alleging the company operates an illegal monopoly in its Google Play app store and adding another front to the internet giant's legal fights. </p><p>   The bipartisan antitrust action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Led by Utah, the suit says the company has monopolized the distribution of apps on mobile devices that run the Google-owned Android operating system, blocking competition through contracts, technical barriers, and other means. </p><p>   In a blog post, Google said it provides an open operating system where customers are free to download apps directly from developers' websites. </p><p>   \"It's strange that a group of state attorneys general chose to file a lawsuit attacking a system that provides more openness and choice than others,\" wrote Wilson White, senior director of public policy. </p><p>   Over the past year, it has faced lawsuits from state and federal officials, as well as international regulators, over its dominance of search advertising and its sprawling ad tech business. </p><p>   Google has built a multibillion-dollar digital empire over the past decade by becoming the primary gatekeeper for apps that are downloaded to smartphones using its Android operating system. It requires apps distributed through its Play Store to use a Google payment system and collects a 15% to 30% service fee on sales. </p><p>   The states' lawsuit challenges Google's description of Android as an open operating system. </p><p>   It targets the in-app payment requirement, saying it has allowed Google to monopolize in-app payments on Android phones and charge excessive commissions. </p><p>   Practices like that harm consumers by raising the prices of apps and weakening competition among developers that could lead to more secure apps with better features, the suit says. </p><p>   The states also accuse Google of trying to \"buy off\"  South Korean smartphone manufacturer Samsung Electronics Co. Samsung's Galaxy app store competes with Google Play, and Google offered to compensate Samsung if the latter company would \"give up its direct commercial relationships in app distribution with consumers and developers,\" the suit says. Samsung didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   The state case against Google's app store follows an antitrust case filed by Epic Games, which alleged that Google acted anticompetitively in operating the store and eventually yanking the company's \"Fortnite\" game from its virtual shelves. Epic has a similar lawsuit against Apple Inc. </p><p>   In a tweet, Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said Google blocks competition on Android phones. \"It's tragic that the \"Don't Be Evil\" company let it come to this,\" he wrote. </p><p>   Google's Mr. White said the states' suit \"mimics a similarly meritless lawsuit filed by the large app developer Epic Games.\" </p><p>   The states began their investigation into Google nearly two years ago. Over the course of the following year, attorneys general focused on separate areas of Google's business with an eye toward bringing a single suit against the search giant, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Instead of one case, the states split up across several issues. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes deemed the Play Store anticompetitive last year. He planned to bring a suit, but decided to wait until 2021 after Colorado and Texas filed separate suits against Google's search and ad tech businesses, according to these people. </p><p>   The Justice Department is scrutinizing Apple's business practices. The state investigation of Google began sooner, according to people familiar with the matter, and was further along than the Apple probe. </p><p>   The suit filed Wednesday came days after Google updated its Play Store policy, requiring developers to use a proprietary application format for apps distributed through its store. The company said the change reduces app size to speed downloads for users. But the policy update triggered criticism from developers who alleged it would lock apps into the Play Store and discourage competing distributors. </p><p>   The updated policy influenced the timing of the Utah filing, the people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   The case could be difficult for states to win. Unlike Apple, which exclusively distributes apps through its store, Android device owners can access apps through other app marketplaces. But proponents of the case argue that the market share of those competitors is dwarfed by Google. </p><p>   Utah says in its complaint that the Play store has a 90% share of app distribution on Android phones and no competitor has more than a 5% share. </p><p>   Google earlier this year reduced its commission on Play store sales, cutting its fees from 30% to 15% on the first $1 million developers earn. Roughly $38.6 billion was spent in the Play store last year, while the App Store generated $72.3 billion, according to Sensor Tower. </p><p>   The Justice Department's antitrust suit targeting Google's search business is scheduled for trial in 2023. </p><p></p>",
