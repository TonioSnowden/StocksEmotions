  "title": "TSMC's U.S. Chip Gambit Has Powerful Backers; The Taiwanese chip maker's investment won't be enough to end U.S. reliance on Asia, but the trend is promising",
  "text": "<p>TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker, said Tuesday it will build a second semiconductor factory in Arizona, bringing its total planned investment there to $40 billion. The first plant, announced in 2020 under a $12 billion investment plan, is expected to start mass production in 2024. The second factory will make chips with 3-nanometer technology, currently the fastest available. TSMC will also upgrade the first plant, originally slated to make 5-nanometer chips, to make 4-nanometer ones. The aggregate 600,000 wafer-a-year capacity of both Arizona factories will now add up to double TSMC's original planned capacity in the state.</p><p>The Taiwanese chip giant's commitment to more than triple its new factory investment in the U.S. is a win for the Chips Act championed by President Biden, which provides subsidies for chip companies to build fabrication plants in the country.</p><p>But in terms of insulating the U.S. from its heavy dependence on Taiwan and South Korea for chips, there is still a very long way to go. While 3-nanometer chips are currently the most advanced, they will probably be a generation or two behind the fastest chips by the time the plant starts production in 2026. And the Arizona plants will still only account for a single-digit percentage of TSMC's manufacturing capacity. Bernstein estimates that the plants will account for around 3% of TSMC's global capacity in 2026, while Morgan Stanley puts the figure at 8%.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bernstein expects the Arizona factories to contribute a high-single-digit percentage of TSMC's 2026 revenue. In comparison, Apple alone accounted for 26% of TSMC's sales last year, according to Bernstein. The $40 billion U.S. investment, spread over several years, is just a bit higher than TSMC's total 2022 capital expenditure, which it estimates at $36 billion.</p><p>Nonetheless one very encouraging sign is that TSMC's key customers are also sending a strong signal of support for made-in-America chips. Chief executives from Apple, AMD and Nvidia all visited the TSMC facilities Tuesday too. Those companies are big TSMC customers and will likely be significant buyers of chips from its Arizona plants. Escalating geopolitical tension between China and the U.S., especially over Taiwan, means they also have a strong interest in making sure some of the advanced chips they need are produced close to homeâ€”rather than exclusively across the Taiwan Strait from the People's Liberation Army.</p><p>Asia will remain the locus of global semiconductor manufacturing for many years. But the U.S. is starting to rebuild its capacity at the margins. For both Uncle Sam and technology titans like Apple and Nvidia, that is likely to be a relief.</p><p>Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com</p><p>TSMC's U.S. Chip Gambit Has Powerful Backers</p>",
