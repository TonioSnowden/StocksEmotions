The Biden administration on Wednesday is expected to issue a sweeping new order mandating that nearly all federal agencies patch hundreds of cybersecurity vulnerabilities that are considered major risks for damaging intrusions into government computer systems, officials said.

You're reading this correctly: Millions of dollars vanished in minutes after a cryptocurrency known as \"Squid\" plunged in value on an exchange called PancakeSwap. Inspired by the hit Netflix show, the tokens previously had spiked in value from one cent to $38 each. The reasons for the subsequent crash are unclear. More than 40,000 investors still hold the currency, creators of which can't be found. (The New York Times)</p><p>National Bank of Pakistan starts restoring systems after cyberattack.

Google has spent the better part of 10 years persuading users to add an extra layer of security verification to their accounts. Now, it is done asking nicely. The Alphabet Inc. unit's decision to automatically enroll users in its two-factor authentication program comes after other tech companies have similarly pushed for greater adoption of the process. Last year, Amazon's smart-home company, Ring, made two-factor authentication mandatory, while Facebook, now known as Meta, began requiring users who run business accounts to use the feature.

The hospital is notifying around 3,000 people that hackers may have accessed their data, including names, medical records, insurance details and Social Security numbers. The center said it stored data in a proprietary medical records format and that it would therefore likely be unusable for hackers.

Cyber can achieve effects not simply within itself, within its own domain but, increasingly, within the larger domain of domains outside of that.\"</p><p>- U.S. National Cyber Director Chris Inglis, speaking at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic International Studies on Oct. 28.</p><p>Privacy Newsâ€Ž</p><p>Yahoo quits China. The firm said it ceased to offer its services from Nov. 1, making it the second U.S. tech firm to cut China operations in recent weeks after the closure of LinkedIn. While Yahoo's announcement didn't cite the Personal Information Protection Law that went into effect Monday, it pointed to an \"increasingly challenging business and legal environment\" in the country. New rules for data privacy and security have added uncertainty and compliance costs to operating in China, and some companies are preferring to pull out rather than deal with the risk.
