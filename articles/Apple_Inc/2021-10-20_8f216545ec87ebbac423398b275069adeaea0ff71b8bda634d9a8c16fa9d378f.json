  "title": "Technology:  Comcast Targets Roku and Amazon With U.S. Smart TV  ----  By Lillian Rizzo",
  "text": "<p>   Comcast Corp. unveiled a TV for the U.S. market, as the cable giant looks to become a dominant distributor of streaming apps and give a boost to its homegrown Peacock service. </p><p>   The new XClass TV will be sold primarily through Walmart Inc., beginning with availability in select stores this week. The first model is being manufactured by China's Hisense, with the lowest-cost option priced at under $300. </p><p>   The company plans to expand distribution and manufacturing partners. With its push into TVs, Comcast is taking on players such as Roku Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as a hub for consumers to access streaming services. That transition is becoming more urgent as consumers cut the traditional TV cord and turn to streaming for entertainment, sports and news. </p><p>   Many companies, including Comcast, already offer streaming set-top boxes like Apple TV or Amazon's Fire TV. But building streaming software directly into TVs has advantages, including lower costs that translate into higher profit margins, industry executives say. Roku-powered TV sets are already on the market. Comcast will be selling its sets nationwide. The Philadelphia-based company has been finding ways to move outside its regional footprint. </p><p>   The set gives Comcast a chance to promote its own streaming service, NBCUniversal's Peacock app. Those who buy the TV will receive a 12-month free subscription to Peacock's premium tier, which costs $5 a month and includes advertisements. Comcast customers already receive a Peacock subscription free if they have a cable subscription or one of the company's Flex streaming boxes. </p><p>   Earlier this month, Comcast entered the smart-TV market outside the U.S. </p><p></p>",
