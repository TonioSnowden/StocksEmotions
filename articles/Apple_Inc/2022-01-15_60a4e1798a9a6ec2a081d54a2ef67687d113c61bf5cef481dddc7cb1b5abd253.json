  "title": "The Weekend Interview with Joseph A. Ladapo: -2-",
  "text": "<p>   When schools prepared to open for the fall 2021 semester, the Ladapos decided their children wouldn't go: \"With masks and testing, my wife and I -- it was just full stop. We would never do that to our kids. We think that -- our personal beliefs are that children shouldn't be forced to place something over their faces.\" They started working with like-minded parents on joint home-schooling arrangements. </p><p>   Then came the job offer from Tallahassee. \"I didn't think my wife would go for it,\" he says. But \"I told her, and she just lit up. She said that she had been waiting for something like that to happen.\" He thought his academic work was going well, but she was worried about \"the direction of UCLA and my career there.\" They settled in the Tampa area. </p><p>   For the benefit of readers who wonder how the other half lives, I ask him to compare California with Florida. \"In Los Angeles during the pandemic, it felt like you lived under a blanket,\" he says. \"People who didn't feel that they needed to take certain precautions, but there was -- they would feel like they needed to be seen as taking certain precautions, because that was the atmosphere, the expectation. It was a very heavy air, sort of an oppressive atmosphere there . . . . </p><p>   \"Here, in contrast, the thing that you feel you're under is the sun. . . . Do you have a mask on you, are you ready to put it on when you go outside or go to a store -- that whole sort of ambiance is completely absent here.\" </p><p>   That resonates with my experience. At Christmas 2020 my wife and I decided to escape New York's lockdown and wait out the pandemic near Miami, where we have a second home. We're still waiting. We were most recently in the Big Apple a month ago, as the Omicron panic was getting under way. We had to show our papers -- vaccine cards and photo ID -- to eat in restaurants. Our last day there, a renewed state mask mandate took effect. It did all feel oppressive, and although I've been a New Yorker for more than 30 years, returning to Florida was like coming home to America. </p><p>   Is it worth the risk? Miami-Dade County has had a higher per capita Covid case count than New York City for several weeks, but its hospitalization rate is somewhat lower. That sounds like a wash until you flip the question: Is the possible reduction in risk worth the price in freedom? </p><p>   After the interview, an aide to Dr. Ladapo sends me a graph ranking all 50 states and the District of Columbia by age-adjusted Covid mortality rates throughout the pandemic. Florida comes in at No. 30. California does slightly better at 33rd, while New York ranks seventh. </p><p>   Florida's permissive policies didn't stop Covid, but neither did other states' restrictive ones. It's an open question whether lockdowns, masking, forced vaccination and the rest have conferred any benefit at all. As the federal government and states like California and New York search for a \"new normal,\" they should consider following Florida's example of simply being normal. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Taranto is the Journal's editorial features editor. </p><p></p>",
