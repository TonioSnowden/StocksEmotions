  "title": "Personal Investing (A Monthly Analysis) --- Shareholders Push ESG Proposals --- Proxy battles include idea to get companies to give sick leave to all",
  "text": "<p>Many analysts of proposals tied to ESG issues thought last year's epic proxy battle pitting startup activist investment firm Engine No. 1 (with $250 million in assets under management at the time) against one of the world's biggest companies, Exxon Mobil Corp. (with a market capitalization at the time of $265 billion) was a landmark. Now they are anticipating more fireworks as emboldened investors push forward with a longer, broader and deeper array of shareholder proposals.</p><p>\"Formerly patient capital has become impatient\" and more willing to support or even propose what once would have been revolutionary changes, says Paul Washington, executive director of the Environmental, Social and Governance Center at the Conference Board, a research group.</p><p>This year's annual meeting of Apple Inc. shareholders in March shows how the winds are shifting. A majority of Apple investors supported a resolution requiring the board to hire a third party to undertake a \"civil rights audit\" of issues at the company including pay equity, leadership diversity and others. In opposing the proposal, Apple said in its proxy statement that it \"already fulfills the objectives of the proposal in several ways, including through impact and risk assessments, active governance and Board oversight, engagement with our communities and key stakeholders, and regular, transparent public reporting.\"</p><p>By a slimmer margin, a majority of Apple shareholders also voted in favor of telling the board to study how the company's alleged use of concealment clauses in employment contracts affects the reporting and oversight of harassment and discrimination allegations. \"Every employee has the right to discuss their wages, hours and working conditions, and this is included in our business conduct policy,\" Apple said in its proxy statement, opposing this proposal as well.</p><p>It is too soon to determine whether the success of those resolutions is a harbinger or an outlier. The proxy season won't end until June. What already is clear, however, is that the number of shareholder initiatives is on the rise. The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a group of institutional investors that advocates for including social values in corporate decision making, reported that its more than 300 members had filed nearly twice as many shareholder resolutions by early March of 2022 as they did during the whole proxy season last year.</p><p>Moreover, the number of resolutions being filed addressing new topics has more than doubled, it said. For instance, the state pension funds of Connecticut and Rhode Island want Mastercard Inc. to evaluate how the credit-card company handles transactions involving unregistered firearms, including kits used to make so-called ghost guns. In its proxy statement, Mastercard, which opposes the proposal, said the company takes \"a vigorous approach to ensuring that only lawful purchases, including only lawful firearms purchases, are permitted on our network.\"</p><p>Regulators laid the groundwork for a broader range of shareholder initiatives at this year's annual meetings.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission last November released a staff bulletin spelling out a new approach to deciding whether or not a corporate board can simply not present a proposal to shareholders for their verdict. Since the 1970s, regulators had taken a broad view of what questions addressed \"ordinary business operations\" or asked CEOs to micromanage their companies, and thus could be excluded from the proxy. Now, the SEC says companies should generally present for a shareholder vote any questions raising \"issues with a broad societal impact.\"</p><p>When Boston-based Trillium Asset Management asked CVS Health Corp. to give all employees -- including part-timers -- access to paid sick leave, the drugstore chain pushed back, asking the SEC for permission to omit the proposal from its proxy. Regulators ruled against the company, telling CVS that the proposal \"transcends ordinary business matters because it raises human capital management issues with a broad societal impact.\" A vote is scheduled for May 11. In its proxy statement opposing the proposal, CVS noted the array of healthcare benefits it offers its employees and said it has offered paid sick days to part-time employees during the Covid-19 public-health emergency declared by the federal government.</p><p>Apple isn't the only tech giant being pushed by shareholders. Meta Platforms Inc. (the parent company of Facebook) faces a dozen proposals from various shareholders, including one that calls on the board to prepare a report analyzing why the company has been \"ineffective at controlling the dissemination of user content that contains or promotes hate speech, disinformation, or content that incites violence and/or harm to public health or personal safety.\" In its proxy statement, Meta opposed the proposal, saying it has 40,000 employees working on safety and security issues, and that \"our actions demonstrate we do not put profits ahead of safety.\"</p><p>Among the resolutions Amazon.com Inc. shareholders will vote on is one that asks the board to examine and report on the company's position on collective labor bargaining -- hard on the heels of the first successful unionization drive at an Amazon facility. In opposing the proposal, Amazon said in its proxy statement that \"our policies afford employees the freedom to form or join a labor organization\" and engage in collective bargaining.</p><p>The new push by investors on the ESG front means that companies have a greater stake in successfully negotiating with shareholder groups to reach compromises and avoid proxy fights like the one between Exxon Mobil and Engine No. 1, which concluded with the activist firm obtaining three seats on the energy giant's 12-person board.</p><p>\"No one wants to face a proxy contest, or have a vote that would embarrass the company or management,\" says Jacob Hupart, a litigation partner at the Mintz law firm in New York.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. McGee is a writer in New England.
