  "title": "Can Apple's Screen Time Reports Actually Help Curb Your Phone Addiction? Some say the weekly notification from the feature offers a helpful check-in point. Others say they only serve to ruin one's morning. Where do you stand?",
  "text": "<p>IT'S SUNDAY MORNING. Apple's weekly Screen Time report says you racked up more hours than usual on your phone. How does that make you feel? The answer depends on a number of factors, but one thing is certain: the tracking software is notoriously divisive.</p><p>According to a 2022 Gallup poll, six in ten Americans think they use their phone too much. Apple says it launched Screen Time in 2019 to help people forge a better relationship with their devices. Your phone tracks how much time you spend tapping away, further divided by how much time you used other specific apps and sites. And each Sunday morning, by default, you receive a push-notification pointing you to a detailed report of what you did with your phone over the last week.</p><p>You can use this data to set yourself soft limits with any given app or category of app. Want to spend less than 4 hours a day on Twitter? A noble goal! Try setting your time allowance for the app to 2 hours. Once you've racked up 120 Twitter minutes, you'll be sent a prompt saying you've hit your \"Time Limit.\" You can take the cue to put your phone down, snooze the notification for 15 more minutes or recklessly dismiss it for the rest of the day.</p><p>Google's Android operating system offers a similar feature, called Digital Wellbeing. And plenty of other similar time-tracking apps are available on mobile and desktop devices. All of these, however, are less visible than Screen Time for one simple reason—that pernicious weekly push notification. Some people find the report's arrival helpful. They say it gives them the tools they need to employ better habits, without requiring much setup. Others, however, think the feature is worthless, and does little more than make them feel bad about themselves. Here, we present both sides.</p><p>Yes, Screen Time helps people adjust their relationship with their devices.</p><p>Advocates of Apple's Screen Time insist it provides crucial information about your habits that can help you change them. Amber Case, an independent researcher who studies the interaction between humans and computers, is one such beneficiary. She knew theoretically that \"cellphones are the new cigarettes,\" but before Screen Time's 2018 launch, would often spend \"seven or eight hours a day\" idly scrolling social media. Her weekly reports revealed she was more likely to reach for the metaphorical nicotine fix when sick or depressed. The knowledge has helped her seek out different coping mechanisms. </p><p>Each Sunday morning by default, Screen Time sends Apple users a push notification alerting them that a report detailing how much time they spent using each app on their phone over the last week is available. PHOTO: WSJ</p><p>It helps, she said, that the Screen Time report presents its findings neutrally, without judgment: \"It's informative without overburdening, it takes something formerly invisible and makes it visible, and it color-codes it so that you can see it clearly. It gives you the chance to make your own decisions.\"</p><p>Kim Key, a journalist for PCMag who's focused on software and online privacy, said that access to such information can assist you in curbing both your own Screen Time and that of your children. The weekly report, she notes, offers a starting point for a conversation with kids about their phone usage.</p><p>Ms. Key, who regularly reviews parental control software, likes that Screen Time is less invasive than other third-party tracking tools which let you read every text your kids send and receive, review every website they visit, and even constantly track their location. Screen Time's simple summary of app usage, she said, lets you empower your children. \"It's an excellent tool to teach kids how to practice moderation,\" said Ms. Key.</p><p>Screen Time can also reaffirm people who feel content with their phone usage. Bethany Nagid, 32, of Portland, Ore., works in operations at a software company. She deleted her own social networks years ago with one exception: an Instagram account for Holly, her pit bull.</p><p>The report provides a weekly check-in that actually makes Ms. Nagid feel good. \"It is confirmation that I'm doing a decent job with my goal of distancing from social media.\"</p><p>No, Screen Time just makes people feel bad about their phone usage.</p><p>A common complaint about the weekly Screen Time report is that checking it inspires little but anxiety. Breetel Graves, 34, a support engineer in Canaan, Conn., with two children, says social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram offer what she sees as necessary downtime in her chaotic life. The amount of time she spends \"zoning out\" with diverting posts already provokes guilt, she said, and getting a weekly report via an invasive push notification only makes her feel lousier. \"I spend enough time shame-spiraling about it all on my own,\" she said.</p><p>EXPLORE BUY SIDE FROM WSJ</p><p>* Should You Upgrade to the New iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Pro?</p><p>* How to Trade in Your Apple Product and Save on a New One</p><p>* The Best iPhone 14 Cases</p><p>If you do want to reduce your app usage, some experts argue that the report ill-equips you. \"Seeing some weekly data dump of contextless data won't help you use technology more intentionally,\" said Chris Bailey, author of \"Hyperfocus\" and the upcoming \"How to Calm Your Mind\" (Penguin Life Books, 2022). Screen Time, he said, would be much more helpful if it collated its findings with other information gathered by your phone. For example, assuming you track your sleep with your iPhone or Apple Watch, Screen Time could tell you if you distract yourself more on days when you are sleep-deprived.</p><p>The findings could get even more granular. On days when you get more exercise, do you spend less time playing video games? Does texting with your ex coincide with an increased frequency of Uber Eats orders?</p><p>Mr. Bailey also takes issue with how Screen Time handles app limits. They're too easy to bypass, he says. The software lets you keep doing what you're doing by just tapping the \"Ignore Limit\" button. Over time, snoozing your limit \"might even become muscle memory,\" he sa. Suddenly, the solution to your problem has become a problem itself.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you find Apple's screen time report helpful? Why or why not?

After studying her reports, she tried using the software to set limits for apps she wanted to use less. The experiment soon short-circuited. \"Ultimately, it was too easy and too tempting to override the Screen Time limits…it didn't curb my screen time usage at all.\"</p><p>Can Apple's Screen Time Reports Actually Help Curb Your Phone Addiction?</p>",
