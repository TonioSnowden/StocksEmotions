  "text": "<p>China's news may add to the sense that inflation has peaked, given the supply constraints that the lockdown there has produced.</p><p>That brings us to our call of the day from a well known voice on Wall Street, Oaktree Capital's founder Howard Marks, who says now's the time for \"bargain\" hunting follow the market's selloff.</p><p>Marks is best known for his lengthy investment letters, and warnings. In early May he cautioned overbull-market excess, which seems as prescient as his similar year-earlier warning.</p><p>\"Today I am starting to behave aggressively,\" he told the Financial Times in an interview. \"Everything we deal in is significantly cheaper than it was six or 12 months ago.\"</p><p>The manager said now seems like a \"reasonable time to start buying,\" noting lower prices for such assets as high-yield bonds, mortgage-backed securities and leveraged loans. Oaktree specializes in alternative investment strategies.</p><p>\"Things may well go lower. In that case, I hope we'll have the will to buy more. It makes no sense to say: \"I'm not going to buy until we reach bottom.\" We never know when we're at the bottom, and certainly I'm not saying we are today,\" Marks said.</p><p>The past year saw him pushing for more defensive investing, as he expected interest rates would go up, pushing asset prices lower.</p><p>He had a particular warning for investors, lulled into complacency by a long bull market, and taking risks without considering the downside. \"And they push into new areas that they have never been in before,\" such as private assets, where he warns that when withdrawals are hitting an \"illiquid market with declining values, those funds melt down.\"</p><p>Bargain hunting does not include bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as he says \"assets that don't have cash flow don't have intrinsic value.\" Whether the young enthusiasts or the older doubters are right should be decided in about 10 years, he said.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Airlines and other China-related travel stocks surged, with travel-booking group Trip.com TCOM up 22%, after the government cut COVID quarantine rules for foreign travelers from 21 to 10 days.</p><p>Nike NKE shares slipped after the sportswear maker posted forecast-beating earnings but gave a cautious outlook.</p><p>The G-7 is expected to announced temporary price caps on Russian gas and oil.</p><p>CVS CVS, Walmart WMTand Rite Aid RAD have been limiting purchases of morning-after pills amid high demand following the Supreme Court ruling stripping the constitutional right to abortions. Instagram and Facebook META have been taking down posts offering those pills.</p><p>On the data front, trade in goods data is due ahead of the open, followed by the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index and consumer confidence. We'll also hear from Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin early and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has fined Ernst &amp; Young a record $100 million for employees cheating on CPA ethics exams.</p><p>The markets</p><p>Stock futures ES00 YM00 NQ00 are rising, with oil prices CL.1 BRN00 also on the rise. Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y are gaining and gold GC00 is getting bid higher. Over in the crypto space, bitcoin BTCUSD is lower, holding just under $21,000.</p><p>The chart</p><p>Here's one of the reasons investors have been a little more optimistic lately â€” an easing in commodity prices (for now at least).
