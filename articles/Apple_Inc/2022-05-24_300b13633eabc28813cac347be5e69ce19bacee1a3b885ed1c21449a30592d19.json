  "title": "Where to Find Champagne-Quality Sparkling Wine in California; When Champagne Louis Roederer set up shop in California's Anderson Valley four decades ago, it was a bold move. It's paid off with delicious wines and a bit of a sparkling boomlet in the valley.",
  "text": "<p>The third in a three-part series about California's Anderson Valley. Read part one here and part two here.</p><p>ONE PLACE IS known for its chalky soils and cathedrals; the other for its apple orchards and pot farms. Champagne Louis Roederer makes wine in both.</p><p>Forty years ago, when Jean-Claude Rouzaud, then-president of Louis Roederer, was searching for a place to make sparkling wine outside France, he chose Anderson Valley in Mendocino, Calif. He bypassed more-famous regions like Napa and Sonoma in favor of this remote valley with the ideal (cool) climate for growing Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. He bought over 500 acres and planted 348 acres to grapes. Today Roederer Estate produces around 100,000 cases of quality sparkling wine and has more vineyard acres (624) in Anderson Valley than any other winery.</p><p>The winery's rustic exterior is more sheep barn than Champagne salon. \"Jean-Claude asked the architect to build a winery that is not in your face,\" said Arnaud Weyrich, senior vice president and winemaker at Roederer Estate. \"He said 'I don't want to be seen as an invader in the Valley.' \" Mr. Rouzaud waited 10 years after his arrival in the valley to build a tasting room, in 1992. \"Jean-Claude said 'No one is going to come here,' \" Mr. Weyrich recalled. Now Roederer is one of Anderson Valley's most-visited wineries.</p><p>Although Mr. Weyrich was born in France, he has been a resident of Anderson Valley for over two decades. His first stint was in 1993, as an intern, after he graduated with a degree in viticulture and enology from the University of Montpellier. Mr. Weyrich returned to France but came back to Anderson Valley along with his wife and two young sons in 2000, when he was hired to work and train with Champagne Louis Roederer's team in California. In 2003 he took over from the retiring winemaker at Roederer Estate.</p><p>In 2004, the company bought longtime Anderson Valley sparkling wine producer Scharffenberger Cellars. Founded by John Scharffenberger in 1981, that winery had previously been sold to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and rather unfortunately renamed Pacific Echo Cellars. The Rouzauds returned the name to Scharffenberger. The winery has its own dedicated winemaker and tasting room down the road from Roederer.</p><p>The breadth of the company's vineyard holdings can best be described in terms of its varied terrain. There are rolling hills of vineyards and crests of fields beyond edges of forests, yet more vineyards and, occasionally, a neighboring farm. When Mr. Weyrich gave me a tour recently, even the weather was various in different parts of Roederer Estate holdings: sun in one spot, a patch of fog just over a hill.</p><p>After a look at the vineyards, where the vines were just beginning to bud, Mr. Weyrich took me to see the houses Roederer Estate is building for its workers. Because housing is scarce and expensive in Anderson Valley, Roederer Estate furnishes most of its employees, both seasonal and year-round, with a place to live. \"You're ensuring a stable workforce and a happy living situation,\" Mr. Weyrich said as we walked through a nearly completed ranch house with a well-appointed kitchen and multiple bedrooms. He pointed out his own house a few hundred yards away, in the middle of vineyards.</p><p>Mr. Weyrich oversees all winemaking at Roederer Estate and makes the final blends; Jean-Baptiste Lécaillon, chef de caves (head winemaker) and executive vice president of Champagne Louis Roederer visits Roederer Estate annually to taste and talk. \"Jean-Baptiste gives us our yearly booster shot of house style,\" Mr. Weyrich said, and he travels to Champagne once a year, too.</p><p>The two men taste the blends Mr. Weyrich has proposed for each wine. Champagne and Champagne method (aka méthode traditionnelle) sparkling wines are blends of different wines from different lots and different vintages as well.</p><p>There are four wines in the Roederer Estate portfolio. Roederer Estate Brut Multi-Vintage ($30) is their flagship wine and, at 88,000 cases, their largest-production wine. The Roederer team prefers the term \"multi-vintage\" to \"non-vintage,\" though most retailers classify this wine as \"non-vintage.\" Chardonnay-dominant and medium-bodied, it's produced from a blend of at least five vintages, in a generous style well-balanced by a bright acidity.</p><p>The Roederer Brut is not only well-made but also remarkably consistent and easy to find, distributed in nearly every state. For both those reasons I've recommended it many times to friends who are looking for a quality sparkling wine at a reasonable price. The Roederer Estate Brut Rosé Multi-Vintage ($36), a blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, is made in much smaller quantities and is harder to find, but it's a delicious wine too, marked by notes of crisp, snappy red-cherry fruit.</p><p>The two top wines are Roederer Estate L'Ermitage ($68) and Roederer Estate L'Ermitage Rosé ($100), made only in the very best vintages and aged much longer on the yeast than the multi-vintage offerings. Like good Champagne, they are highly ageable, too, as Mr. Weyrich demonstrated with a tasting of several L'Ermitage wines that went all the way back to the 1989 L'Ermitage. While some, like the rather oxidative 1989, showed their age, others, like the 2006 L'Ermitage and the 2011 L'Ermitage, were remarkably fresh—equal parts complexity and deliciousness. The current vintage, the 2015 L'Ermitage, was beautifully balanced, creamy but delicate, with a youthfully bright acidity.</p><p>Mr. Rouzaud's determination and vision, not to mention his willingness to gamble on the notion that an obscure foggy valley could produce a wine like Champagne, has certainly paid off. Now in its 40th year, Roederer Estate has not only burnished the reputation of Louis Roederer Champagne but also the reputation of Anderson Valley as a wine region that is truly first-rate.</p><p>Field Trip</p><p>Roederer's presence has helped to foster a bubbly boombelt in the valley. Three spots to visit.</p><p>Roederer Estate</p><p>The options are numerous at Roederer's understated, elegant tasting room and outdoor patio. All Roederer Estate's wines are offered for tasting; Champagne Louis Roederer's are available for purchase by the bottle. Guided tours of the estate are available, too. Tastings are $20 per person. Hungry visitors can opt for tastings accompanied by a short menu including caviar and duck rillettes. Open daily 11-5, Reservations required. RoedererEstate.com</p><p>Lichen Estate</p><p>Douglas Stewart sold Breggo Cellars, a label specializing in Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris, in 2009, but he held on to the land and the winery as well as the tasting room. These became Lichen Estate, where he produces still and sparkling wines, including Champagne-method blends of Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris. (The winery is well known for the latter variety.) Tastings are $25 per person and available by appointment only.LichenEstate.com</p><p>Toulouse Vineyards</p><p>When Vern and Maxine Boltz bought their 312-acre site, Mr. Boltz, a retired captain of the Oakland Fire Department, planted Pinot Noir. He began making wine in 2002 and later added a lovely Champagne-method Pinot Noir/Chardonnay blend, Goose Bubbles, with assistant winemaker Rita Vodopals, plus a Pinot Noir-based Amaro and a Vermouth. Tastings $20, waived with purchase, free to club members. ToulouseVineyards.com</p><p>Write to Lettie Teague at wine@wsj.com</p><p>Where to Find Champagne-Quality Sparkling Wine in California</p>",
