  "text": "<p>Covid turmoil is roiling Apple's biggest manufacturer. On Monday, Foxconn Technology Group said its November revenue dropped 11% from a year earlier after a Covid outbreak weighed on shipments from its facility in Zhengzhou, China. The so-called iPhone City is where hundreds of thousands of workers make Apple products. In November, workers protested over wages and Covid restrictions. The Wall Street Journal on Dec. 3 reported that the iPhone maker has accelerated plans to shift some of its production outside of the country. Apple shares declined 0.8% Monday.</p><p>PEPSICO INC.</p><p>PEP -1.4%</p><p>A snack and beverage giant is slimming down. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that PepsiCo is laying off hundreds of workers in North America, as a wave of corporate layoffs extends beyond tech and media. The maker of Doritos, Quaker Oats and its namesake cola joins other companies in cutting costs ahead of a possible recession. After reporting a jump in quarterly sales and profits, PepsiCo executives in October said they were cutting costs to offset the pressure on profit margins and to weather worsening macroeconomic conditions. PepsiCo shares fell 1.4% Monday.</p><p>SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.</p><p>LUV -4.7%</p><p>Southwest's quarterly dividend is taking flight again. The airline is the first major carrier to reinstate the payout after more than two years as the travel industry recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic. The dividend payments -- which amount to $428 million a year -- could become a flashpoint in its already tense labor contract negotiations with pilots and other worker groups. Southwest shares lost 4.7% Wednesday.</p><p>CAMPBELL SOUP CO.</p><p>CPB +6%</p><p>Sales are still cooking at Campbell. The soup and snack maker boosted its outlook and said fiscal first-quarter sales rose 15% on the back of higher prices, though volumes -- which have been shrinking as prices rise -- fell 1%. Chief Executive Mark Clouse said higher prices and productivity measures helped the company mitigate rising costs. Like other food makers, the company saw costs climb amid industrywide supply-chain constraints. Companies have looked to pass those costs on to customers, who are adjusting their spending. Campbell shares gained 6% Wednesday.</p><p>CARVANA CO.</p><p>CVNA -43%</p><p>Carvana faces a bumpy road as its shares sputter. The struggling used-car seller hired restructuring advisers and its bondholders signed an unusual agreement to cooperate in case the company did a deal that hurt them, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. Investors say they are frustrated at executives' handling of the downturn and are anxious about being pushed aside in a restructuring that could involve Chief Executive Ernie Garcia III's father. The company's creditors include Apollo Global Management Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co. Carvana shares sank 43% Wednesday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN +2.1%</p><p>Amazon is taking a page from TikTok's book. The e-commerce giant is rolling out a short-form video feature in its app that will allow \"social shopping,\" where customers can buy products from a customized feed of photos and videos. Amazon launched the feature for select customers on Thursday and plans to make it available across the U.S. in the coming months. Amazon joins its tech peers in capitalizing on the popularity of the short-video format that has powered the rise of social-media app TikTok, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance Ltd. Amazon shares rose 2.1% Thursday.</p><p>ACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC.</p><p>ATVI -1.5%</p><p>Regulators are taking aim at Microsoft Corp.'s acquisition of a videogame heavyweight. The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued Microsoft to bar its planned $75 billion acquisition of Activision, taking one of its biggest shots under the Biden administration at halting a merger of technology giants. The FTC said the deal would allow Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles -- Sony Group Corp. and Nintendo Co. All three companies also develop and publish their own games. Activision shares lost 1.5% Thursday.</p>",
