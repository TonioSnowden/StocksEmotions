  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Eating & Drinking: When In Doubt, Pickle It --- Pickling is unbelievably easy. Really, the microbes do all the work and you reap the crunchy, scrumptious rewards.",
  "text": "<p>Let's start with the quick-pickle method. Step one, choose your vegetable. Onions are a classic for this method, but any veggie will work. Peel or cut the vegetable into the shape you want it to be -- in our onion example, this would be slices -- and place in a container. Next pick a vinegar. Any type will work, technically speaking, but balsamic would make weird pickles, so try apple cider vinegar or just plain old distilled white vinegar. Cut the vinegar with water in a 1-to-1 ratio. Then, for every cup of liquid add 2 teaspoons of salt. If you want a slightly sweet pickle add the same amount of sugar. Heat this mixture until the salt is dissolved. Pour the brine over your veggies. Wait half an hour or more. That's it. Keep your quick pickles in the fridge and pull them out whenever you have a burger, as a condiment. They add nice zip to salads, too.</p><p>Though the lacto-fermentation method is, as I've said, even easier, people fear it. They'll ask if they need any milk. No, not that kind of lacto. In this method, you harness the power of lactic acid bacteria by creating a brine salty enough to prevent any other bacteria (or mold) from surviving. You've been eating lacto-fermented pickles your whole life. Kosher dill pickles are a famous example. So is sauerkraut.</p><p>For a salty-enough lacto-ferment brine you need 1 teaspoon of salt for every cup of water, which you can heat to help the salt dissolve faster. Let that brine cool, pour it over your vegetables, cover and leave at room temperature. Then, you wait until the vegetable is sour to your liking. This could take 3 or 4 days, but it could be longer if you like sour pickles. Keep tasting every day to know how far the sour has progressed. Once the pickles taste the way you want, put them in the fridge to stop the bacteria's acid production.</p><p>Once you start pickling vegetables it's easy to fall down a briny rabbit hole. If this happens to you there are some fantastic resources available to the home lacto-fermenter. One is \"The Noma Guide to Fermentation\" by Rene Redzepi and David Zilber. The chapter on lacto-fermentation does an excellent job of breaking down the science into layperson speak. The choice of ingredients is sometimes a little out-there, but it illustrates that anything can be preserved this way. Another great book is Sandor Ellix Katz's \"The Art of Fermentation,\" an epic compendium of the knowledge of controlled rot.</p><p>Either the quick or lacto method will yield a bonus ingredient that is often just poured down the drain. The brines themselves take on the character of the vegetables they cure and make wonderful additions to sauces, vinaigrettes and soups. The lacto-fermented brines will have additional complexity from the fermentation. Before you toss any brine, give a thought to how you might want to use it instead.</p><p>On our farm there is a walk-in cooler with a section where my name is written on tape on the wall. Under it are crates and crates of leftover vegetables. I will spend many summer weeks just making pickles to be sold in the winter months. It's one of the easiest parts of my job. The salt, vinegar and bacteria do all the work.</p><p>---</p><p>Quick-Pickled Red Onions With Oregano</p><p>Active Time: 10 minutes</p><p>Total Time: 4 hours (includes chilling)</p><p>Makes: 1 pint</p><p>For the quick-pickle brine:</p><p>3/4 cup water</p><p>3/4 cup distilled white or apple cider vinegar</p><p>1 tablespoon salt</p><p>1 tablespoon sugar</p><p>For the pickles:</p><p>1 medium red onion, thinly sliced</p><p>1 teaspoon dried oregano</p><p>1. Make the quick-pickle brine: In a medium saucepan, combine water, vinegar, salt and sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring, until salt and sugar are dissolved. Remove saucepan from heat.</p><p>2. Make the pickles: Place onions and oregano in a pint jar or container. Add warm brine to cover. Place lid on jar and seal. Transfer to refrigerator.

Make the lacto-ferment brine: In a small saucepan over low heat, combine water and salt. Heat, stirring, until salt dissolves. Cool to room temperature.</p><p>2. Make the pickles: Place carrots in a pint jar or container. Add paprika and cayenne. Pour brine into jar so it covers everything. Place a small piece of plastic wrap or wax paper directly on surface of brine to cover. Cover loosely with lid and let stand at room temperature 1 week.</p><p>3. After a few days, taste for acidity. Continue to let carrots brine at room temperature for a more acidic pickle, or transfer jar to refrigerator to stop fermentation.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
