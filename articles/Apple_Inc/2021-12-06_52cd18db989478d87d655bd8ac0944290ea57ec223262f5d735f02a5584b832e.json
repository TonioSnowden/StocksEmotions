  "text": "<p>For as much as Donald Trump resents the “lamestream” media, from now on he must benchmark himself against it. Over the weekend, the blank-cheque vehicle Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which plans to merge with the nascent Trump Media and Technology Group, announced that it had raised $1bn in fresh cash.</p> <p>On Monday, the companies finally disclosed the details on Trump's plans. This will be a Trump-themed Twitter and Netflix cross, offering mass-market viewership loyal to MAGA values.</p> <p>In typical fashion, Trump offered some loose revenue projections, but details were scant. The companies provided neither expense estimates nor cash flow projections in a very expensive industry to grow quickly. Yet the current trading price of the Digital World Spac implies a value for Trump's pending media empire of roughly $9bn.</p> <p>TMTG will have two business segments. A microblogging website like Twitter called Truth Social and a streaming media service known as TMTG+. By 2026, Truth Social expects to have 81m users. Twitter has more than 300m today. A quarter of those Truth Social users will be “monetisable”, annually generating $13.50 each in advertising revenue. </p> <p>The bulk of TMTG's top line will come from charging $9 per month for its video service. The $9 per month sits between what Netflix and Disney Plus charge today. By 2026, Trump forecasts having 40m TMTG+ subscribers. Fox News, the incumbent voice of conservative politics in America, has recently launched its own streaming service. It has managed to sign up only 1m customers.</p> <p>Apart from sketchy aggressive topline forecasts, shareholders should ask how much its technology and customer acquisition will cost. Streaming services and social media companies in early years have incinerated cash.</p> <p>Wall Street has nevertheless given TMTG the benefit of the doubt. The $1bn Pipe, or private investment in public equity, raised from undisclosed parties as a starting point offers a formidable war chest. Shares of Digital World now trade at $40 — well above the $10 listing price. The Pipe shares are set to be sold at a premium to $10, an unusual structure for blank-cheque mergers.</p> <p>Monday's details reveal that any mania in Digital World shares is a boon for Trump himself. At current stock prices, TMTG could receive 40m extra “earnout” shares in Digital World, representing roughly a fifth of the company's equity. If Trump really is a mainstream brand, he may well believe he rightly deserves this added bonus. More sceptical investors should ask why.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Trump Spac: Former president needs to reach mainstream acceptance to hit user goals' FT.com 6 December.
