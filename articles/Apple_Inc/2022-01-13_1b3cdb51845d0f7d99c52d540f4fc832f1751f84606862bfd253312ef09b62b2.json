  "text": "<p>Early Thursday, TSMC said it had budgeted $40 billion to $44 billion to increase its fab capacity amid a global chip shortage that has lasted for more than a year. That's double what the company pledged this time last year when it unveiled a $22 billion capital expenditure budget.</p><p>TSMC reported fourth-quarter revenue of $15.74 billion, a 24% jump from a year ago, as the company fills high demand for the silicon wafers that go into making semiconductors. The company forecast first-quarter revenue of $16.6 billion to $17.2 billion.</p><p>“Our fourth-quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry leading 5-nanometer technology,” said Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, in a statement.</p><p>“Moving into first quarter 2022, we expect our business to be supported by HPC-related demand, continued recovery in the automotive segment, and a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years,” Huang said.</p><p>TSMC supplies chip makers who do not have their own fabs like Nvidia Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, and Apple Inc. AAPL</p>",
