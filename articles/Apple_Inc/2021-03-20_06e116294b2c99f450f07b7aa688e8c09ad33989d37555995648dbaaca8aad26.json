  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Adventure & Travel: Protection Doesn't Make Perfect --- Now that the vaccine rollout is here, stymied vacationers are eager to roam free. But big questions remain",
  "text": "<p>After a year of isolation and oppressively endless Zoom sessions, many of the newly vaxxed feel the same way. But it's not a get-out-of-jail-card quite yet: In Mr. Volny's case, with the exception of Greece this fall, his journeys can't happen until 2022. And that gets to the paradox of the vaccine rollout and hopes for a travel reboot: Most of the world isn't ready to roll back testing and quarantine rules for travelers just yet. We're still in a pandemic, after all, and only a small percentage of the world's population has gotten the jab.</p><p>Many countries -- including most of Western Europe -- still aren't open to U.S. tourists. Cases are rising in some areas; most of Italy, for example, just retreated into lockdown after a variant reared its head. You'll still need to practice social distancing and wear masks for the foreseeable future, especially when you are in public with people you don't know.</p><p>Moreover, the CDC, which recently eased restrictions on small gatherings, continues to counsel against travel, even for the vaccinated. That's because there's still a risk of getting and spreading Covid-19 while away from home, the agency said. But the advice could change, according to a spokesman for the agency \"as more people are vaccinated and we learn more about how vaccines work in the real world.\" As travel resumes many people will want to dip their toe in gradually, said Joe Brancatelli, who runs the road warrior site joesentme.com. Here, some things to keep in mind as we get on the road again:</p><p>Where can I go?</p><p>In most places, the rules haven't changed. Only a few countries are letting U.S. visitors bypass testing and quarantine rules if they have been vaccinated; among them are Belize, Iceland, the Seychelles and Georgia. More countries should join the list later this year. Thailand, for example, has said it will lift its mandatory quarantine restrictions in the third quarter of this year for travelers with proof of vaccination. Even if your destination still requires a recent negative test, being vaccinated greatly reduces the odds you'll test positive and end up in quarantine.</p><p>What's a vaccine passport?</p><p>The race is on to come up with a standardized, all-purpose mobile app that will let you summon your health data, from vaccinations to tests, in one tap. \"It's the proverbial Wild West out there,\" said Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research. None of the existing options \"is better than the other.\" Most have partnerships with airlines, like the Travel Pass developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is already being test-driven by big airlines such as Emirates and Singapore; the app should be available soon starting with Apple devices, IATA said. Others include Common Pass and Verifly, backed by United and American, respectively, among other airlines. Each essentially works the same way -- giving you proof of immunity in digital form that obviates the need to show a paper document. But some people might prefer an analog version to having multiple health apps on their smartphones. Others may be reluctant to share health data online. Until such concerns are resolved, it might be wise to laminate that CDC card you get when leaving the vax site so it won't disintegrate in your wallet.</p><p>Where are the deals?</p><p>In a crisis year, bargains abound, right? Not necessarily. \"Cheap coach airline tickets will be scarce,\" Mr. Brancatelli predicts. With flights still down about 50% from before the pandemic, it might take time for airlines to restore capacity to their route networks. But you might still score some good deals, according to the fare prediction site Hopper, which is betting that the window for finding the lowest domestic fares for summer will be from April 27 to May 7. International airfares will be lowest in the last weeks of both June and July, and in mid to late August, according to Hopper economist Adit Damodaran.</p><p>What if I am inoculated but my kids aren't?</p><p>That's a tough one. There's currently no approved vaccine for those under 16 years old. For some travel suppliers, including a few cruise lines, minors traveling with a parent or guardian may be exempt from vaccine requirements if they have a negative test.</p><p>---</p><p>What's Up, Doc?</p><p>Two physicians specializing in epidemiology and infectious diseases on when -- or if -- the vaccine will reboot travel, and their own personal vacation plans for the coming year</p><p>DR. DAVEY SMITH</p><p>Head of Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health, University of California at San Diego</p><p>Is it safe to travel after being vaccinated?</p><p>\"The CDC is being a bit conservative on restricting travel for vaccinated folks. Data is still coming in to help them make these decisions, so I bet that travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people will be lifted soon. And 'safe' is a relative word. Everyone has different risk assessments. Your risk isn't zero, even if you do get the vaccine.\"</p><p>Where he's going this year</p><p>Tennessee to visit family; the Galapagos Islands to celebrate his 50th birthday.</p><p>DR. DAVID ARONOFF</p><p>Director, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center</p><p>Is it safe to travel after being vaccinated?</p><p>\"[Vaccinated] travelers in the U.S. pretty much can go wherever they want to domestically. We do need to keep our eyes on disease activity across the U.S., but so far things seem to be improving. Certainly I would avoid areas where there are increasing rates of infection. I'm optimistic about the near future. Soon, as more of the population gets immunized, we will see the CDC loosen its travel restriction guidance. Given that the vaccines could be available to most or all American adults in a few months this will likely be sooner than later.\"</p><p>Where he's going this year</p><p>Washington state to see his mother; Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin to tour colleges with his daughter.</p>",
