  "text": "<p>For breakfast, on a rooftop overlooking a windswept beach in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b01d0b2-0ffe-11e3-a258-00144feabdc0\">Essaouira</a>, we were given mint tea and some jam and honey to top our Baghrir pancake. This pancake is one of the wonders of Moroccan cuisine, a bit like a crumpet but lighter and tangy. </p> <p>There was also a pot of something that looked like peanut butter, which seemed strange — an unwelcome interloper in this north African spread. Yet since there was jam on the table and the PB&amp;J appeal is too hard to resist, we dipped into the pot and found that it wasn't peanut butter at all but something even more magical. As it melted into the hot, holey pancake, it released the most exhilarating aroma. </p> <p>At first bite we realised that no jam was needed, all the sweetness was there — and so much more.</p> <p>This, we discovered, was <em>amlou</em>, a combination of ground almonds from the Atlas Mountains, generous amounts of precious argan oil and nature's finest sweetener — pure honey. It is so rich and delicious, so sophisticated in flavour, that we return to it time and again. Take about a cup of toasted, best-quality almonds and grind them quite finely. Move them to a bowl and mix in about five tablespoons of argan oil, the same amount of good honey and a pinch of coarse sea salt — and then thank us forever for introducing you to this heavenly spread. </p> <p>If that feels a bit too easy, you can raise your <em>amlou</em> game to the next level. We tried using it as a filling for cookies and cakes but the delicate aromas of the argan oil don't tolerate any heat. So we took the same ingredients and came up with this frozen dessert, which is almost as simple to make and keeps all that <em>amlou</em> magic. </p> <p>You can serve this parfait on its own — it is, as the name suggests, perfect — or you can top it with sea salt and a good slug of argan oil. It also goes very well with chocolate sauce (we believe that all desserts should at least have the option of chocolate). Port or Madeira on the side will work a dream or, indeed, fresh mint tea.</p> <h2>Almond, honey and argan oil parfait</h2> <p>To make six individual servings</p> <p><strong>For the almond parfait</strong></p> <p><strong>For the chocolate sauce (optional)</strong></p> <ol>  <li><p>Have six moulds ready. Use either a silicone muffin tray or small glasses or bowls. </p></li>  <li><p>Place the flaked almonds in a small frying pan over a medium heat and stir until they start to colour. Sprinkle the sugar all over and mix until it dissolves and starts to caramelise. Remove from the heat and spoon evenly into the six moulds.</p></li>  <li><p>In a large bowl, mix the almond butter, honey, sugar and oil until it forms a thick paste. Add the double cream and mix with a handheld whisk until it thickens but doesn't fully whip — it should be the texture of very thick custard. Pour this over the almonds in the moulds and place in the freezer for at least six hours, until entirely frozen.</p></li>  <li><p>If you have used a silicone tray, you can simply pop the parfaits out when you are ready to serve. If you used glasses or metal moulds, dip them really quickly in boiling water, then flip to remove the parfaits. </p></li>  <li><p> You can serve them just as they are, but if you want to add the luxury of hot chocolate sauce, simply boil the cream and milk, pour over the chocolate and salt and whisk until fully dissolved. Then let everyone slosh on as much sauce as they like.</p></li> </ol> <p><em>Sarit and Itamar will be appearing at the FT Weekend Digital Festival, March 18-20.
