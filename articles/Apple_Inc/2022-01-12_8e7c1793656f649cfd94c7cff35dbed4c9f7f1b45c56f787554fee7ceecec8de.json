  "text": "<p><em>Happy new year from Ken in Tokyo! The Covid-19 pandemic is casting a shadow over our new year celebrations again, with a clueless government making life harder than necessary. Yet there is a lot happening in the world of tech. India's biggest conglomerate Reliance Industries has made an equity investment in Google-backed Dunzo, a hyperlocal delivery start-up in the country (Art of the deal). China's ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing has started preparation for its second-chance IPO in Hong Kong (Mercedes's top 10). Sony has revealed its mobility-as-a-service ambitions (Our take). Stay safe till next week.</em></p> <h1>The Big Story — Exclusive</h1> <p>Huawei, the Chinese tech giant targeted by US sanctions, is on a semiconductor supply chain investment blitz aimed at shoring up its capabilities in the face of pressure from Washington, according to an <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/Huawei-bets-big-on-chip-packaging-to-counter-U.S.-clampdown\">investigation by Nikkei Asia</a>.</p> <p>In 2021 alone, the company's investment arms — including Hubble Technology Investment Co — took or raised stakes in more than 45 domestic tech companies, more than double the 2020 figure. </p> <p><strong>Key developments:</strong> About 70 per cent of Huawei's investments last year were in semiconductor-related suppliers, ranging from chip developers and design tools to production equipment and materials, the investigation found.</p> <p>The strategy is aimed at bolstering self-reliance. In one example, Huawei started a collaboration with Quliang Electronics, a little-known chip packaging and testing supplier based in Fujian province. Quliang is helping Huawei put its advanced chip assembly designs into production and trial some of its cutting-edge chip stacking and packaging technologies.</p> <p>The embattled tech group has also accelerated efforts to hire experts from leading suppliers such as ASE Technology Holding of Taiwan, the world's top chip packing and testing service provider, sources told Nikkei Asia. ASE declined to comment.</p> <p><strong>Upshot:</strong> Such efforts are crucial to Huawei's fight for survival. The focus on domestic investments shows an intent to develop a self-reliant supply chain that is not vulnerable to US sanctions.</p> <h1>Mercedes' top 10</h1> <ol>  <li><p>Exclusive: <strong>China's </strong>ride-hailing giant Didi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7faaa91e-e190-4e98-aeab-f1287aedd21d\">is in talks</a> to list shares in <strong>Hong Kong</strong> after its disastrous <strong>US</strong> IPO.

(Nikkei Asia)</p></li> </ol> <h1>Our take</h1> <p><strong>Apple</strong> co-founder Steve Jobs was known to have been a big fan of <strong>Sony</strong>. He was inspired by the user experience Sony products offered with their design and precision manufacturing. Products such as the Walkman and portable video camcorders created completely new ways of enjoying music and shooting video. Former Apple chief executive John Sculley has said that Jobs wanted Apple to be a Sony, not an <strong>IBM</strong>.</p> <p>Sony-inspired Jobs went on to create a new way of enjoying music and the internet with iPods and iPhones. These products combined excellence in hardware design, software and online services. Ironically, they left Sony far behind. It took more than a decade for the Japanese company to figure out how to create a cool user experience in the connected digital age.</p> <p>But now, Sony has announced it is entering the electric mobility space at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, citing its advantage in robotics, artificial intelligence, gaming and other entertainment technologies. The announcement is believed to have pre-empted Apple, which is also known to be developing driverless car technology. The main goal is likely to be the yet to emerge market for driverless “mobility-as-a-service”, or MaaS.</p> <p>This time around in the mobility market, Sony is a newcomer, with no legacy products or factories, which is to say no “innovator's dilemma”. Any player can design vehicles and outsource manufacturing to contractors these days. The winner will be decided by the attractiveness of the user experience, together with impeccable safety features. This requires a wide variety of technologies such as AI, robotics, sensors and other sorts of semiconductor chips, controller software, and so forth. Sony and Apple, and a bunch of others, are on the same starting line. All have a chance to win.</p> <p>Many observers will be absorbed with how the third round of the Apple-Sony rivalry will develop in this new mobility context.</p> <p><em>— Ken</em></p> <h1>Spotlight</h1> <p>Gautam Adani, the Indian billionaire, has an eye for green bonds. He is issuing the paper to fund the transformation of his ports and power generation empire into <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Adani-to-lean-on-green-bond-market-for-renewables-expansion\">the world's largest renewables group</a>.</p> <p><strong>Adani Green Energy</strong>, his renewables business, raised $750m in green bonds in September. Now, the entrepreneur intends to tap the market further to fund an ambitious $20bn investment plan.</p> <p>Adani has put the transformation at the heart of his plans for a business empire that maintains a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. <strong>Adani Total Gas</strong>, a joint venture with <strong>Total Holdings</strong> of France that supplies natural gas, was the best performer among the group's listed shares last year. Adani is also beginning to import coal from a mining project in Australia that climate campaigners failed to block.</p> <p>Hydrogen is part of those ambitions. “Renewable energy opens several new pathways for us including setting up one of the largest green hydrogen producers in the world,” Adani said in an interview. “Our actions indicate that we are putting our money where our mouth is, as over 75 per cent of our planned capex until 2025 will be in green technologies.”</p> <h1>Art of the deal</h1> <p>Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani is embracing “<a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Retail/India-s-Reliance-enters-instant-grocery-delivery-with-Dunzo-stake\">quick commerce</a>”. His conglomerate, <strong>Reliance Industries</strong>, has invested $200m for a 25.8 per cent stake in domestic delivery start-up <strong>Dunzo</strong>. </p> <p>Reliance will use Dunzo to provide deliveries&#xa0;from the group's retail stores as well as neighbourhood grocers&#xa0;that market themselves&#xa0;on <strong>Jio Mart</strong>, its online grocery operation.</p> <p>“We are seeing a shift in consumption patterns to online and have been highly impressed with how Dunzo has disrupted the space,” said Isha Ambani, a director at <strong>Reliance Retail Ventures</strong>.</p> <p>Dunzo debuted in 2014 as a delivery network that accepted requests from consumers on <strong>WhatsApp</strong> to move anything from food to stationery for a fee. It transitioned into delivering from stores, charging businesses a part of the order value. Dunzo launched a quick-commerce operation last year, promising grocery deliveries in less than 20 minutes.</p> <p>Reliance's investment in Dunzo accentuates the fierce competition among quick-commerce businesses, some of which promise deliveries as swiftly as within 10 minutes. Incumbents include&#xa0;<strong>Swiggy</strong>, a food delivery start-up backed by&#xa0;<strong>SoftBank</strong> and <strong>Naspers</strong> that has committed about $700m to scale up.</p><p>Source: Ken Koyanagi, Nian Liu and James Kynge 2022 'China's Huawei seeks self-reliance with chip investment blitz' FT.com 12 January.
