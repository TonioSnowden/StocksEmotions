  "title": "Chinese Suppliers Now  Shun Uyghur Workers  ----  By Liza Lin in Singapore, Eva Xiao in Hong Kong and Yoko Kubota in Liuyang, China",
  "text": "<p>   Chinese factories that supply Apple Inc., Nike Inc., and make other products sold in the U.S. are shunning workers from Xinjiang, as Western countries increase scrutiny of forced labor from the remote northwestern region where Beijing has been accused of committing genocide against local ethnic minorities. </p><p>    Lens Technology Co., a Chinese maker of smartphone touch screens and supplier to Apple and other companies, phased out Uyghur factory workers transferred from Xinjiang through a state-backed labor program last year, former staff and shop owners near one of its factories said. The company has also stopped hiring Uyghur workers, current staff said. </p><p>   Chinese mask producer Hubei Haixin Protective Products Group Co., whose personal protective equipment is sold on U.S. e-commerce sites, no longer employs laborers from Xinjiang, a company employee said. The company decided not to renew the contracts of its Xinjiang laborers in September after reports last year alleging the use of forced labor drew negative attention, the employee said. </p><p>   And a Chinese subsidiary of Taekwang Industrial Co., which makes sneakers for U.S. sports giant Nike in China, sent workers from the region home in the second quarter of 2020, according to a Nike statement that was on the company's website in June 2020. The company's statement has been updated, but the old version has been stored by the Internet Archive, a nonprofit that keeps a digital library of webpages. </p><p>   It couldn't be determined if Xinjiang workers at Lens facilities were producing components that ended up in Apple products. An Apple spokesman said in the past year and a half, the company conducted more than 1,100 audits and interviewed 57,000 workers to check if suppliers were following its standards. The company's Supplier Code of Conduct prohibits any kind of discrimination. \"We will continue doing all we can to protect the rights of workers across our supply chain, and ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect,\" he said. </p><p>   Spokespeople from Nike and Taekwang declined to comment. </p><p>   The about-face by Chinese suppliers that have collectively hired thousands of Xinjiang workers through government-backed labor programs highlights the growing pressure that firms face as Western governments push multinationals to eliminate forced labor from their supply chains in China. Rights groups and Western researchers have accused Xinjiang authorities of mass internment and exploiting what the Chinese government calls labor-transfer programs to force Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims from the region to work at factories around the country. </p><p>   Washington, the most vocal critic of Beijing's policies in Xinjiang, has taken aim at such labor transfers by issuing import bans on cotton, tomatoes and polysilicon from the area over the past year. In response, many multinationals have organized supply-chain audits in China, while trying to avoid provoking Beijing. Last week, the Senate passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act by unanimous consent. The bipartisan bill, which faces likely approval in the House, would ban goods produced by Xinjiang workers in state-run programs unless importers prove otherwise. </p><p>   Beijing has denied all rights-abuse allegations and has said state-run transfers of Uyghur, Kazakh and other mostly Muslim minority laborers are part of poverty-alleviation programs. Such workers might be punished for speaking out about their working conditions, rights groups said, while auditing firms said the workers are wary of retaliation, making it difficult to verify to what extent the programs are involuntary. </p><p>   Uyghur and labor-rights groups said it is a step in the right direction for Chinese suppliers to refrain from such programs, but want brands to also ensure workers are compensated when they leave and aren't simply transferred to less visible and more poorly run factories through the same state-backed labor program. </p><p>   Before Lens Technology let go of its Xinjiang workers last year, the touch-screen manufacturer was an active participant in the local government's labor-transfer program. </p><p>   But last summer, as scrutiny on Xinjiang grew, the company let go more than 400 workers from Xinjiang working at Lens's main facilities in Liuyang, a city under the administration of the Hunan provincial capital of Changsha, where the company is headquartered. </p><p>   The fired workers were given between $1,500 and $2,900 in compensation because they were let go before their contract ended, said a former Lens worker who was among those cut loose and returned home to Xinjiang. Some of the workers then attended a new training program and were sent to work in Jinhua city in eastern China and at a mask factory in Changsha, the worker said. </p><p>   The company isn't hiring any Uyghur factory workers this year, two hiring agents at Lens said. Lens didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   As scrutiny over forced labor from Xinjiang mounts, some factories are phasing out participation in state-run labor programs to avoid getting hit with restrictions on exporting to the U.S. Human-rights groups said that while factories opting out of labor-transfer programs is a positive development, cutting ties with Xinjiang workers across the board is discriminatory. They said suppliers should opt out of state-backed labor transfers but continue to hire Xinjiang workers who apply independently. </p><p>   \"These factories appear to care more about preventing scandals than fair-hiring practices,\" said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. </p><p></p>",
