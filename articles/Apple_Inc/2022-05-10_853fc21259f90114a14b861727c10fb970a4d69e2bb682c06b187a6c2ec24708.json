  "text": "<p>\"Today, the spirit of the iPod lives on,\" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's worldwide marketing senior vice president.</p><p>Released in 2001, the first iPod helped Apple co-founder Steve Jobs remake the company, extending its reach from computers into other personal devices and vastly expanding Apple's reach in the music industry.</p><p>For some consumers, the iPod—which came in various color iterations and models—was their first introduction to Apple.</p><p>The iPod helped usher in a new era for music in which songs could be downloaded for 99 cents—separated from albums by artists—and loaded onto a device about the size of a deck of cards. The iPod helped make music more portable and was a smash hit, helping to pave the way for the company to unveil the iPhone, which put even more key functions onto one device.</p><p>Now, as smartphones have grown even more sophisticated and music is largely streamed rather than accessed through paid downloads, iPod sales have diminished. Apple hasn't separated iPod sales for years, but unit sales fell by about 24% in fiscal 2014 compared with the previous fiscal year.</p><p>IPhones are now equipped with music streaming, advanced cameras, maps with GPS navigation and many more functions, all factors that contributed to the iPod's obsolescence.</p><p>The original iPod weighed 6.5 ounces and was discontinued several years ago. It served as a replacement for items like CD players, which often limited users to listening to a select album one at a time.</p><p>Apple later introduced the iPod Mini in 2004 and the iPod Nano in 2006. The iPod Touch was released in 2007 and the iPod Nano (7th generation) came out in 2012.</p><p>Apple released the iPod Shuffle (4th generation) in 2015 and the iPod Touch (7th generation) two years ago.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Apple Is Discontinuing the iPod After a More Than Two Decade Run</p>",
