  "title": "'Emily in Paris' Creator Darren Star Wasn't Going for a Millennial Stereotype; The TV showrunner also talks about his Oura ring obsession, how his routines change from city to city and his favorite 'White Lotus' character",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Star, who lives in Los Angeles, New York and Paris, likes to begin each day reading hard copies of the newspapers. And like Emily, he loves to indulge in a freshly baked croissant. Here, he shares the cafe where he starts his days in each city and why procrastination is a key to his success.</p><p>What time do you get up on Mondays, and what's the first thing you do?</p><p>I get up at 7 a.m., with or without my alarm. I've gotten very obsessive about all my sleep apps. I wear my Apple Watch and my Oura ring, and the first thing I do when I wake-up is cross reference how much sleep I've gotten. They're generally pretty in sync. The Oura ring is nice because if I've gotten a bad night's sleep, it'll give me little encouraging slogans like, \"You'll be OK.\"</p><p>What do you eat for breakfast?</p><p>I'll do a couple shots of espresso when I wake up. I love going out to breakfast. In Paris, I love going to Café de Flore and buying the papers [at] the newsstand right there. In L.A., Kings Road Café or Sycamore Kitchen. In New York, I love going to Balthazar and sitting at the counter there.</p><p>What are your writing routines like? Is there a place where you get your best writing done?</p><p>I'm a big procrastinator. I'll let the stress and tension of the deadline build up until finally I can do it literally anywhere. I can sit on the Jitney going to the Hamptons and write. Something clicks where I'm just all in. I can very easily write in bed.</p><p>What's a vice of yours?</p><p>A great almond croissant.</p><p>Emily is very millennial, while \"Sex and the City\" is known for its portrayal of Gen X women. How do you think the two generations are different? Which generational stereotypes do you actually believe?</p><p>The relationship to privacy and sharing is different between those two generations. You can't make too many broad generalizations because a character like Emily is a millennial, but I don't know if she fits the stereotype of a millennial. She's an ambitious striver—I feel like that's a character that's present in every generation. She's someone who wants to succeed and has a big heart.</p><p>In the show's love triangle, are you Team Gabriel or Team Alfie?</p><p>I'm Team Emily.</p><p>What are you reading and watching?</p><p>I have some go-to books I love for inspiration, like \"The War of Art.\" I love reading history and novels. I just finished \"The Lincoln Highway\" by Amor Towles and now I'm reading \"The Splendid and the Vile\" by Erik Larson. I watched the last seasons of \"The Crown\" [and] \"The White Lotus.\"</p><p>Do you have a favorite \"White Lotus\" character?</p><p>Well, Jennifer Coolidge. I could watch it with the sound off, and I would still be enjoying watching her.</p><p>What were you most looking for when you tried to hire the team around you?</p><p>You have to feel like you have chemistry with the people you're spending time with. You've got to feel like there's an instinct for that. A sense of humor. I've been working with a lot of the same talented writers over the years. When you're having fun together in the room, that sensibility gets translated into the show. Putting together a writing staff in a way is like putting together a great dinner party. You want different voices that all work in harmony together.</p><p>What's a piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>Don't believe everything you think. We all get into those cycles of negative thinking, and I think that was a nice piece of advice.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Write to Lane Florsheim at lane.florsheim@wsj.com</p><p>more My Monday Morning:</p><p>* Gwen Stefani Isn't Ruling Out a No Doubt Reunion</p><p>* Why Baz Luhrmann Swears by $3 Hair Gel</p><p>* Why 'Jeopardy!'
