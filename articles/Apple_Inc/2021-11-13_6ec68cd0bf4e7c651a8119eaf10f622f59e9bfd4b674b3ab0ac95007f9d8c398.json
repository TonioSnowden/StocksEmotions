  "title": "​​From torment to swagger: Edvard Munch's photographic selfies",
  "text": "<p>“My mind is like a glass of cloudy water. I am now letting it stand to become clear again,” wrote Edvard Munch in 1908. The Norwegian artist had drawn back from the abyss. He had checked into a Copenhagen sanatorium to address his mental exhaustion and alcoholism. And to his prescribed schedule of healthy eating, treatments and sleep, the painter added his own way to refocus: by taking photographs. Between sessions of gentle “electrification” and recuperative baths, he snapped his nurses, picturing them as benevolent phantoms. </p> <p>Munch's fascination with photography informed a small but intriguing body of work — just 261 prints and 30 negatives survive — that touched on many of the artist's obsessions, from spiritualism and naturism to the possibilities of the printing process and, most prominently, his never-ending interest in himself. </p> <p>His photographic adventure — as playful and avant-garde as it was therapeutic — is now being told at MUNCH, the new 13-floor reboot of the Munch Museum and one of the largest museums in Scandinavia, a colossal structure that looms like a spectre of statement architecture over the Oslo Fjord. Here, Munch's photographs complement corresponding paintings and prints, while an online exhibition titled <em>The Experimental Self</em> ties together two distinct chapters in the artist's engagement with the medium: the first is a tale of trauma, the second a story of sanctuary.</p> <p>Munch bought his first camera, a Kodak Bulls-Eye No 2, in 1902, the year that he was shot in the hand during a tussle with his lover Tulla Larsen. In the early 1900s, Munch's life was chaotic. His photographs from that time show a man half-present — either literally, through the blurring or ghosting of his body, or through distant, melancholy poses. He is seen passing through rooms and translucent in front of his paintings. He ducked out of one dining-room composition with the shutter still open, allowing the grain of the wood panelling behind him to surface through his face. In other pictures, he sits marooned on stools and travel trunks, lost in thought. His camera accompanied him as he painted, both <em>en plein air</em> and in the studio. Nudity features significantly in the resulting photographs: a female model, wearing nothing but stockings and a look of ambivalence, is pictured in a Berlin studio, while the artist himself stripped off for a 1903 self-portrait, in which he plants himself among the trees of his garden at Åsgårdstrand.</p> <p>There was more flesh to come. In 1907, on the German coast at Warnemünde, he photographed a gaggle of male skinny-dippers on the sand dunes (the painter was naked at the easel). And, in the local hotel, he set up a spectral composition featuring sisters Olga and Rosa Meissner. In it, Olga is clothed but hardly visible, while Rosa is undressed, head bowed and clear. The image echoes the motif of his “Weeping Woman” paintings of the same year; it remains a mystery which came first, the photograph or the paintings (they are exhibited together at MUNCH). Shortly after his time in Germany, Munch sought a cure for his misery at the sanatorium.</p> <p>Unlike many of his contemporaries, including the Norwegian painter Harald Sohlberg, Munch did not use photography merely as a recording tool, a first step to making larger paintings in the studio. A few Munch photos correspond with paintings, but largely he was interested in seeing what potential the medium had to create images in its own way.</p> <p>From the start, he was a radical snapper. His younger sister, Inger, was a documentary photographer and he would have understood the technical elements. Kodak provided a users' guide, which Munch ignored. “The book told you exactly where to stand, how to take the pictures, what the f-stop should be, what the lighting should be,” says Patricia G Berman, who curated <em>The Experimental Self</em> exhibition at Scandinavia House in New York in 2017, on which MUNCH's online version is based. “There was a constant warning saying absolute failure will result if you do A, B or C. And everything they said is precisely what Munch did. Consistently.”</p> <p>These mistakes became his photographic language. Initially, he printed the modest photographs himself — each 9cm x 9cm — using a home kit with processing chemicals, developing box and windowsill trays. His finger and thumb prints, along with traces of oil paint, marked the emulsion paper. These, Berman notes, are “scruffy, little, one-to-one-ratio prints, where they came right off the negatives”. And they were private: Munch never exhibited them, seeing himself as a professional painter but an amateur photographer. </p> <p>Munch's experimentation, with both the taking and the processing of photographs, included double exposures, moving subjects during the exposure and reversing negatives. He printed alternative, flipped versions of the same image, just as he did with his woodblock prints. And the duality of many of his paintings — in which light and dark planes and male and female figures contrast and interact — materialised in his negatives.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there were echoes of his earlier paintings: a self-portrait taken in the clinic was inspired by his oil painting “The Death of Marat”, itself a play on a masterpiece by Jacques-Louis David. Naturally, in both modes, Munch casts himself in the title role.</p> <p>Munch called the photographs he took between 1902 and 1908 his “Fatal Destiny” pictures. But his destiny was anything but fatal. Following his tentative cure in the Copenhagen sanatorium, he survived a bout of flu in the 1918 pandemic, created his large panoramic works for Oslo university and settled into a quiet life at Ekely, his country estate on the fringes of Oslo, where he was prolific both as a painter and printmaker. Following a break of nearly two decades, he returned to the viewfinder. A&#xa0;second series of photographs was created in the calm after the storm. Taken in the late 1920s and early 1930s, these pictures provide a unique window on the shadowy period of the painter's autumnal years at Ekely. </p> <p>Old-man Munch is often cast as a recluse, successful but withdrawn, grumpy even, but that's not the whole story, as his photographs reveal. While unkempt, naked or downhearted in the “Fatal Destiny” works, here he strikes a natty pose, sharp in fedoras and crisp collars, a gentleman of status, wealth and property. In perhaps his most charming photograph, he captures his shaggy fox terrier Fips, sprawled out on the veranda. Munch shoots through the window, producing a geometric play of light and, to the right of the composition, his own profile in shadow. It's like a Bauhaus pet portrait.</p> <p>Projection and speculation by art historians about Munch's photography, along with the posthumous titling of images, might have elevated whimsy and accident to method and meaning. Munch himself stated: “As long as the camera does not exist in Heaven or Hell, painters have no cause to fear competition from it.” But, emotional limitations aside, Munch recognised that the medium had considerable potential, particularly with self-portraiture. </p> <p>In Ekely, during the early 1930s, Munch produced some of the first artist-made selfies. His arresting series of arm's-length shots — various configurations of head, shoulders and hat, all punctuated by a prominent chin and a patrician manner — were executed on lightweight, handheld cameras, some not much larger than an iPhone. Just as insecurity and introspection had guided his earlier photographs, here there is ego and vanity. But it was narcissism for an audience of one. It was a familiar contradiction: when a reporter arrived unannounced at Munch's door, he was refused an interview and then invited in for champagne. Meanwhile, the artist's semi-transparent features, emerging like watermarks, continued to appear in images of his stacked paintings.</p> <p>The camera was also a business tool. He put photographs of his paintings in catalogues sent to collectors and commissioned photographers to take studio shots: heroic images of him painting, perched on ladders and outside in the yard, dabbing at canvases weathering in the winter air. These shots presented a character to the public, of Munch the master. </p> <p>But he was also impish. In snippets of film, shot by Munch on a Pathé-Baby cine camera in Norway and Germany, the lasting impression is of a boy with a toy: he flings the lens in every direction — a darting eye following trams, cars and bicycles — while, in front of the camera, he prances like Charlie Chaplin. There was, he saw, little point in making a static movie. And he drew on photographs. On a print of his snow-covered garden, he doodled a cartoon of himself in blue ink, pictured with a cigarette burning under the brim of his hat, alongside a sketch of his dog. The intent is unknown; perhaps it was an experiment in mixed media or, more likely, a gift never sent (he would often draw on postcards to friends).</p> <p>“He was a funny guy. He had a twinkle in his eye,” says Signe Endresen, a curator at MUNCH who digitised the exhibition. He could be almost sunny. He took his dog on outings to the cinema and joked that in later life he had learnt the benefits of “nicotine-free cigars, alcohol-free drinks and non-poisonous women”. The public perception of him as a moody genius dated back to the 1890s, with the creation of disquieting masterpieces such as “The Scream” and “Vampire”. His later seclusion, Endresen explains, was “connected to his desire to work. People coming by all the time was a distraction.” He had become a tourist attraction.</p> <p>Viewing his tiny photographs at MUNCH emphasises their compressed energy. These mechanically produced miniatures share a stage with monumental works such as “The Sun” and “The Researchers”, vast canvases created for the ceremonial hall of Oslo university, paintings so large they had to be shipped across the fjord and craned through a hole in the wall. His snaps fit in the palm of your hand.</p> <p>“I have an old camera with which I have taken countless pictures of myself, often with amazing results,” Munch told a journalist in 1930. “Someday, when I am old, and I have nothing better to do than write my autobiography, all my photographic self-portraits will see the light of day.” He was almost 70 at that point, yet his photographs from the time depict a durable figure, a man still in the game.</p> <p>Munch's mercurial snapshots trace the survival of an artist obsessed with loss. But, while his mind might have cleared in the Copenhagen clinic, with the anxieties diluted and the light let in, his photographs remain tantalisingly opaque a century on. </p> <p><a href=\"https://the-experimental-self.munchmuseet.no/\"><em>the-experimental-self.munchmuseet.no</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first. </em></p><p>Source: Christian House 2021 '​​From torment to swagger: Edvard Munch's photographic selfies' FT.com 13 November.
