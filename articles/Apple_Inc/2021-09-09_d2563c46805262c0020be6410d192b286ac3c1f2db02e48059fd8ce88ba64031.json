  "text": "<p>At Ray-Ban's flagship stores across the US and the UK, a new model of Wayfarer sunglasses went on sale on Thursday. They look almost identical to the classic model, first sold in 1952, except for one thing: they have Facebook embedded in them.</p> <p>Ray-Ban Stories, as the new model is called, are Facebook's first pair of camera glasses, which allow wearers to take videos and photos hands-free from a first-person perspective, before uploading them to social media.</p> <p>Users can also listen to music or take calls with the glasses, which will be available in 20 different styles with both dark and clear lenses. Prices start at $299.</p> <p>The glasses come five years after rival Snap launched its camera glasses, and eight years after Google Glass, which included a camera as well as a display, was hyped as the future of wearable technology. Google suspended sales of its smart glasses in 2015 after complaints that they represented a threat to privacy and a lukewarm public reception. </p> <p>The company has tried to address one of the main criticisms of camera glasses wearers — that they are too bulky or that they look bizarre — by integrating two cameras, three microphones and tiny speakers in a way that they are barely visible. </p> <p>But as a result, the company may face more accusations of breaching privacy. </p> <p>Matt Simari, a product manager in Facebook's 10,000-strong AR and VR department, said Facebook made an “intentional” decision to have the cameras activated in a way that alerts others around them — either by clicking on a small button on the side of the glasses, or via voice command using an integrated voice assistant. </p> <p>Whenever the video is rolling, a small LED on the side of the glasses will light up to indicate to those nearby that they are being filmed, he added.</p> <p>Facebook also promised that the experience would be ads free, and that users' content would not be used for personalised advertisements, and only accessed with permission. </p> <p>Facebook is entering an increasingly crowded market as the glasses wars heat up. Apple expects to launch its own smart glasses next year, while Snap <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/827c213f-fdd6-4307-8040-8aae8629a784\">became the</a> first leading US tech company to unveil AR glasses in May this year, albeit with limited capabilities and to a restricted audience.</p> <p>The Facebook Ray-Ban glasses will not have an augmented reality display, but Facebook said they were only “the first product” in a “multiyear partnership” as the social network starts building out products for the evolution of computing beyond smartphones. </p> <p>Simari declined to disclose sales targets or the revenue share on the product between the company and EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban's owner, but said: “We're not dipping our toe in the water, we're jumping in. We really believe in this product, we believe in this category.”</p><p>Source: Hannah Murphy in San Francisco 2021 'Facebook and Ray-Ban launch camera glasses' FT.com 9 September.
