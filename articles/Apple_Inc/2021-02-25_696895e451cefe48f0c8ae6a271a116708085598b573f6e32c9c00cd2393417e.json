  "text": "<p>\n  How does the music business decide who helped write a song? With everyone from Bob Dylan to Shakira selling their songbooks for huge sums, it's an increasingly important question. </p><p>\n  The market for song catalogs has never been hotter thanks to the success of streaming, a view on Wall Street that music royalties are a valuable asset and artists looking to cash out before a potential increase in the capital-gains tax. </p><p>\n  This is fueling a music-copyright gold rush, including recent sales by members of Wilson Phillips, Post Malone collaborator Louis Bell, and pop producer Ryan Tedder, who sold a majority stake in his catalog, including songs by Beyonce and Adele, to investment firm KKR, in a deal valuing his catalog at nearly $200 million. </p><p>\n  The sales benefit anyone credited with writing a hit song. Yet who gets that credit is complicated. In 2020, the average number of writers on a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart was 5.5 writers, according to Gary Trust, Billboard's senior director of charts. That's up from 2.1 writers in 1990. </p><p>\n  It is an open secret in the music industry that not all of the people credited with writing a song actually did. Songwriters are increasingly giving chunks of their publishing copyrights to top producers or superstar artists for production work, guest appearances or songwriting opportunities, executives say. For songwriters, this reduces royalties and means a smaller catalog, which can lead to a lower payout. For fans, it means an album's liner notes about who wrote what may be misleading. </p><p>\n  Here, four key questions about songwriting \"splits\" as they are known: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  How do splits work? </p><p>\n  Every recorded song has two copyrights -- one for the songwriting (the melody and lyrics) and another for the sound recording itself (the \"master\" recording). Songwriters and publishers, who are separate from record labels, own the songwriting copyright, earning royalties on sales, streams, performances and use in television, films and videogames. Labels historically have owned the sound-recording copyright. </p><p>\n  Only about 15 cents of every dollar of income generated by a song on Spotify or Apple Music in the U.S. goes to songwriters and publishers, according to industry estimates. The majority -- some 55 cents -- goes to the owners of the sound recording. (The streaming service gets the other 30 cents.) </p><p>\n  Today, this 15 cents is shared by several songwriters. That's partly because superstars sometimes send out half-done songs to 10 potential contributors and pick the best contributions -- a \"song-by-committee\" approach that increases the number of songwriters, says Hayleigh Bosher, an intellectual-property law scholar. </p><p>\n  But there is no standard way to determine splits, leaving the process open to the power moves of producers and stars with the most muscle. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Do things vary across genres? </p><p>\n  Yes. Rock bands often have it simpler, especially if they write their basic tracks before hitting the studio, making it clearer who wrote what. In pop, more songwriters are involved and the contributions of writers and producers may blur. A common scenario is for two songwriters to work with a producer, with the credits split equally, according to Ashley Page, founder of Page 1 Management. </p><p>\n  It is more complex in hip-hop in part due to the frequent use of song samples. The writers of sampled songs become songwriters on the new track. A hip-hop song can start as a 50/50 split between the \"beat\" or instrumental (supplied by a rap producer) and the lyrics (supplied by a rapper). The more samples, producers and guest rappers involved in the song, the more splits. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  So what's the problem? </p><p>\n  There have long been instances of powerful people sometimes grabbing credits. But in recent years, it's become routine for important producers to ask for a chunk of the song's publishing even if they didn't write much or at all, music executives say. \"I'm not sure why it was allowed to creep in,\" says Mr. Page. \"It really comes down to your own conscience and ethics.\" </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, big-name artists may seek a cut of songwriting for making a guest appearance. If someone gets credit for even 1% of a song's writing, they receive equal billing in the liner notes -- giving the fan the impression that there was a significant contribution. Receiving a slightly smaller split may not sound like much of a loss for a songwriter. But those lost chunks add up over the course of a career, crimping their ability to build a hefty portfolio. \"Your rights can be your pension,\" says Ms. Bosher. </p><p>\n  Some artists have spoken out about the issue. Jack Antonoff, an artist, songwriter and producer who has worked with Taylor Swift and Lorde, has discussed what he called a \"problem of producers taking writing credit.\" \"I've had many personal scenarios where someone's produced something for me, and then called my manager and [wanted writing credit],\" he said in an interview with the Journal in 2017. \"And I'll be like, 'But they didn't write it'.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  What's driving the grabbing of credits? </p><p>\n  Hip-hop, which blurs the line between songwriting and production, has changed the way pop hits are made. Today's pop songs often involve a bedrock track made by a producer -- just like in hip-hop -- normalizing the practice of pop producers asking for publishing credit. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, ownership of music copyrights is increasingly a focus for powerful artists and producers who know how much they're needed for a hit to pop: Some 55,000 new songs are uploaded on streaming services every day, making the value of having a household name attached to your song vital. </p><p></p>",
