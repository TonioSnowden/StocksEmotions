  "title": "These Steve Jobs Birkenstocks just sold for $218,750 at auction; There appears to be a growing collectibles market for all things related to the Apple co-founder --- including a 'well used' pair of sandals that he used to wear, which retains the imprint of Steve Jobs' feet",
  "text": "<p>\"Steve Jobs wore these sandals during many pivotal moments\" in the company's history, the Julien's auction site noted.</p><p>Obviously, the footwear wasn't in top condition. The auction house described the sandals as \"well used, but (they) still appear intact,\" adding that each \"sandal features its original Birkenstock adjustable buckles and Birkenstock stamping on the inner edge of the suede leather foot straps. The cork and jute footbed retains the imprint of Steve Jobs' feet, which had been shaped after years of use.\"</p><p>This is hardly the first occasion that Jobs' personal items have come up for sale. Earlier this year, an auction held by the RR auction house featured such offerings as a 1982 note from Jobs (it sold for $124,998) and a Jobs business card (it sold for $13,289).</p><p>Still, the footwear auction appears to show there's no saying what some people will pay for anything connected to the tech titan, who died in 2011. Julien's originally estimated the sandals would sell for between $60,000 and $80,000.</p><p>These Steve Jobs Birkenstocks just sold for $218,750 at auction</p>",
