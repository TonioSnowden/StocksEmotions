  "text": "<p>A lot of standard features</p><p>Excellent engine options</p><p>Posh interior</p><p>Smooth, comfy ride</p><p>Cons</p><p>Expensive</p><p>Inefficient</p><p>Rivals have more cargo space</p><p>What's new?</p><p>Wireless charging removed from the standard inventory</p><p>Price:&#xa0;The 2022 BMW X7 has a starting price of $74,900 for the xDrive40i model. The higher-performance M50i starts at $99,800, and the Alpina XB7 comes in at $141,300.</p><p>If you want a big luxury SUV and have a big budget, the BMW X7 is a strong contender. It's a 3-row SUV and the biggest model in the&#xa0;BMW XE:BMW&#xa0;stable, competing directly with the&#xa0;Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class. Even in the third row, the interior is spacious, but the long-wheelbase variants of its American competitors like the&#xa0;Cadillac Escalade&#xa0;and&#xa0;Lincoln Navigator&#xa0;have even more room. The X7 has one of the most excellent interiors in this competitive class, with a classy design and premium materials throughout.</p><p>Another area where the X7 shines is performance. With two lively engine options, this big SUV still has the engaging driving dynamics of a BMW. The BMW X7 isn't cheap, but neither are most of its competitors. For a more budget-friendly alternative, you could consider the&#xa0;Infiniti QX80, but it doesn't match the BMW in terms of luxury and performance.</p><p>2022 BMW X7 pricing</p><p>The 2022 BMW X7 starts at $74,900 for the base xDrive40i model. For the V8-powered M50i model, pricing starts way up at $99,800. The base model is a better bang for the buck, but the M50i is worth it if you have the room in your budget and that extra performance is important to you. Like most BMW models, the price can climb quickly when you start adding options.</p><p>Although Alpina is an independent tuning house, the XB7 — from $141,300 — still comes with a full factory warranty.</p><p>Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their new X7.</p><p>Also see:A Russian oil-sparked U.S. recession? This is how it could happen</p><p>Driving the 2022 BMW X7</p><p>It's no 3 Series, but the BMW X7 is still fun to drive. The base engine is a turbocharged inline-6 with brisk acceleration. The 8-speed automatic transmission shifts quickly and smoothly, and you'll hardly notice it's there in everyday driving.</p><p>BMWFor more muscle, upgrade to the 523-horsepower twin-turbo V8 in the M50i model. The V8 is a gutsy engine with a satisfying exhaust note and a thrilling 0-60 mph time of just 4.5 seconds. That's quick for an SUV of this size.</p><p>The X7 gives priority to comfort over sportiness. This BMW is a family SUV with a smooth, compliant ride (thanks to standard air suspension), lots of cool tech features, and plush seating. The interior is hushed with the base engine, but the M50i has the pleasing sound of a more raucous V8.</p><p>The available Dynamic Handling Package on both X7 trims makes this big SUV handle a little more like a sport sedan. It adds M Sport brakes, 4-wheel steering, and a feature called Active Comfort Drive with Road Preview. This uses cameras to detect upcoming imperfections in the road and adjust the suspension accordingly. This improves both comfort and agility.</p><p>The Alpina XB7 has the kind of performance that shouldn't be possible in a large luxury SUV. Standstill to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 205 mph.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>The BMW X7 seats six or seven depending on the seating configuration. It comes standard with a bench secnd-row seat, or you can upgrade to second-row captain's chairs if you can spare the extra seat. The first two rows are spacious and comfortable. The third row is pretty easy to access thanks to power-sliding second-row seats, but taller adults will be a bit cramped back there.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch: Fed official doesn't think housing market is headed for a crash: ‘I am trying to buy a house here in Washington and the market is crazy'</p><p>The cargo space of the X7 isn't huge for a full-size SUV. It has 12.8 cubic feet of cargo space when all of the seats are in place. If you fold down the second- and third-row seats, that can increase to 90.4 cubic feet.</p><p>Interior design and overall quality are high points for the X7. This opulent interior uses top-notch materials that you can customize to your liking. There are different leathers and colors available for the seats. You can choose between multiple different wood accents or a more modern-looking glossy piano black for the interior trim. In classic BMW fashion, the interior design is luxurious while also being straightforward and driver-oriented.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The BMW X7 is an SUV that makes a statement. The handsome design is imposing and upscale with its large kidney grille, broad, horizontal light signature in front and back, and a range of stylish wheel options. It does an excellent job looking opulent with a hint of ruggedness that you want from an SUV.</p><p>The M50i has a sportier aesthetic than the base xDrive40i model. However, the base trim can get the sporty look of the M50i by opting for the M Sport package. The sportier look adds Shadowline exterior trim, different wheel options, and an aerodynamic body kit.</p><p>The Alpina XB7 has its own aerodynamic additions and special-design 21-inch alloy wheels.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>M Sport PackageThe available M Sport Package makes the xDrive40i model look more like the pricier M50i with upgraded wheels, an aerodynamic body kit, nicer seats, and more.</p><p>Power second-row seatsThe X7 has power-sliding second-row seats to make the third row easier to get in and out of at the touch of a button.</p><p>You might like:What it's like to drive the Alfa Romeo Giulia</p><p>Standard features</p><p>As the BMW brand's flagship SUV, the X7 is exceptionally well-equipped. A few of its luxurious features include an air suspension system, panoramic moonroof, 4-zone automatic climate control, three rows of synthetic leather seats, heated front seats and armrests, heated steering wheel, memory driver's seat, remote start, adaptive full LED headlights, and ambient interior lighting.</p><p>The standard infotainment system is a large 12.3-inch screen loaded with features like Android Auto, Apple AAPL CarPlay, navigation, SiriusXM SIRI, HD Radio, and two USB ports. On top of the infotainment system in the center stack is a customizable 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster.</p><p>The X7 has a nice suite of standard safety tech features, including automatic high beams, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, traffic sign recognition, front/rear parking sensors, and a backup camera.</p><p>Also see: 2021 Maserati Levante: Fabulous, fantastic, Italian flair…seriously expensive</p><p>Factory options</p><p>The X7 has many option packages available. Building on the base model, there's a Parking Assistance Package ($800) with a 360-degree camera, a drive recorder, and Parking Assistant Plus and a Premium Package ($1,900) adding soft-close automatic doors, power rear side window sunshades, a head-up display, and gesture control for the infotainment system.</p><p>If you want a sporty appearance but don't want to pay for the pricey M50i model, you could get the base trim with the M Sport Package ($4,350). This is primarily an appearance package with an aerodynamic body kit, different wheels, Shadowline exterior trim, an M steering wheel, Vernasca leather seats, an Alcantara headliner, and more options for interior trim.</p><p>The content of all three of these option packages comes standard on the X7 M50i. The significant upgrade with the M50i model is the twin-turbo V-8 engine that gives this big BMW SUV a substantial upgrade in performance. The M50i model also adds M Sport brakes, differential, steering wheel, and exhaust, and a memory passenger seat.</p><p>Also see:The 9 things that are most likely to affect your auto insurance rates</p><p>A Cold Weather Package ($1,100 for either trim) adds second-row heated seats and 5-zone climate control. There's also a Dynamic Handling Package ($3,850 for xDrive40i, $3,450 for M50i) that adds all-wheel steering and Active Comfort Drive with Road Preview, which can adjust the suspension based on perceived imperfections in the road ahead of you. On the xDrive40i trim, it also adds M Sport brakes.</p><p>An Executive Package ($3,200 for xDrive, $1,300 for M50i) adds some luxury features to the base trim that come standard on M50i like soft-close doors, power rear sunshades, a head-up display, and gesture control. It adds the Panoramic Sky Lounge LED roof with over 15,000 LEDs, heated and cooled cupholders, and posh glass controls on both trims.</p><p>A Driving Assistance Professional Package ($1,700 for either trim) is available, adding extended traffic jam assist and Active Driving Assistant Pro. This adds full-speed adaptive cruise control, active lane-keep assist, steering and traffic jam assistant, automatic lane change, evasion assistant, and front cross-traffic alert.</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>The base engine in the 2022 X7 xDrive40i model is a turbocharged inline-6 producing 335 horsepower. Despite the size and weight of the X7, this engine moves it along quite well.</p><p>Check out:7 off-the-radar places worth stopping on a California road trip</p><p>For more excitement, consider upgrading to the M50i with its twin-turbo V8. This is a significant performance upgrade with 523 horsepower, giving the X7 much stronger acceleration and a more satisfying sound.
