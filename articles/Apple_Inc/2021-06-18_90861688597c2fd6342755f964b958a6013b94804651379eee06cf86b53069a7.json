  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- Authorities sent shudders through Hong Kong media outlets after police arrested the top editor of a popular daily newspaper and the city's security chief warned of severe punishment for anyone who uses news to challenge China's national security. </p><p>   More than 500 officers on Thursday searched the newsroom of Apple Daily, founded by jailed Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, and arrested five executives, including its editor-in-chief Ryan Law, who was led away in handcuffs from his home. Police officers took away computers and searched desks, having obtained a court warrant for search and seizure of journalistic materials. </p><p>   Police said the arrests were related to more than 30 unspecified Apple Daily articles published since 2019 that played a crucial part in a conspiracy to encourage foreign sanctions against Hong Kong and China. </p><p>   John Lee, Hong Kong's secretary for security, told reporters that the operation targeted acts that weren't related to \"normal journalistic work\" but used the news as a tool to endanger national security. He sent a wider chill through the city by warning people, including reporters, not to align themselves with the arrested executives and journalists. </p><p>   \"You will pay a heavy price by associating with these criminals,\"  Mr. Lee said, calling for people to cut ties with them before it is too late. Some of these offenses could be punishable by life in prison, he added. </p><p>   Press freedoms and other civil liberties in Hong Kong are increasingly being eroded under the national security law, rights advocates and media observers say, as Beijing makes clear it won't tolerate dissent and challenges to its power in the city. The arrests raised new questions about how journalists can report on pro-democracy groups and comments from overseas that could be deemed in violation of the national security law, which China imposed almost a year ago after antigovernment protests in 2019. </p><p>   The impact of the police actions on the broader news industry and even readers in Hong Kong is \"extremely grave,\" said Yuen Chan, a senior lecturer at the department of journalism at City, University of London. </p><p>   Beijing's representative office in Hong Kong said that \"press freedom is no shield for illegal activities.\" </p><p>   Apple Daily, founded in 1995 by clothing tycoon Mr. Lai, has criticized Beijing and openly supported the pro-democracy protest movement of 2019. </p><p>   Mr. Lai has been a top target of national security police. He was arrested in August during an earlier police raid on the paper, owned by publicly listed Next Digital Ltd., and is in jail for participating in protests and awaiting trial on charges of foreign collusion. In May, Hong Kong police froze Mr. Lai's assets, including his majority stake in Apple Daily. </p><p>   The newspaper stayed true to its beliefs, angering pro-Beijing figures who called for authorities to shut it down. </p><p>   Steve Li, a senior police superintendent, told reporters that the 30 articles identified by police provided ammunition for foreign countries or groups to impose sanctions. </p><p>   In addition to Mr. Law, others arrested Thursday, Apple Daily said, included Cheung Kim-hung and Royston Chow -- respectively the chief executive and chief operating officer of Next Digital -- as well as associate publisher Chan Pui-man and a news director named Cheung Chi-wai. Their residences were also searched. </p><p>   Police sealed off the newsroom and employees were made to register at makeshift tables, a live stream by the paper showed. Journalists already in the office were ordered to leave, and at least one officer was pictured looking through materials on a staffer's computer, Apple Daily said in a Facebook post. Mr. Li, the police official, said officers had to look into computers to find evidence. Some 38 computers belonging to journalists were confiscated, the paper later added. </p><p>   Police officers took the personal details of employees who had just arrived, but barred them from entering their offices. An Apple Daily reporter filmed the police search from outside the building, peering into the newsroom through thick windows. </p><p>   \"Journalism is not a crime. We are enraged by the arrests made by the police today,\" the newspaper's union said. It added that the court warrant allowing journalistic materials to be seized could damage public confidence in the news media and hurt the paper's ability to obtain interviews and information. </p><p>   Chris Yeung, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, said the police operation was spreading fear among journalists and members of the public. </p><p>   \"People will feel unsafe, uneasy talking to the media,\" he said, urging the government to provide more details about the case. \"Self-censorship will get worse if journalists are not sure whether they are able to protect their sources,\" he said. </p><p>   Even after the latest arrests, Apple Daily remained defiant. In an online letter to readers, it said: \"We will press on.\" </p><p></p>",
