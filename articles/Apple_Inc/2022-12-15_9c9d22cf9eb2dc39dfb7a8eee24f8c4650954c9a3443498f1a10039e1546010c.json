  "title": "Vol. 35, No. 11: Antisemitism",
  "text": "<p>The spellings, without a hyphen or the uppercase S, have been increasingly adopted. The term anti-Semitism—like many others dealing with race and ethnicity—has come under fire for its history.</p><p>The Associated Press made the change to antisemitism last year. \"Anti-Semitism\" was a label popularized in 1879 by the German journalist Wilhelm Marr. AP editors when they made the spelling change noted that Marr \"opposed efforts to extend the full rights of German citizenship to Jews. He asserted that Jews were Semites—descended from the Semitic peoples of the Middle East and thus racially different from (and threatening to) Germany's Aryans. This racist pseudoscience was applied only to Jews, not Arabs.\"</p><p>Jewish scholars and others have made the same point for years. They argue that using the lowercase, unhyphenated spelling properly turns the label into a generic term meaning anti-Jewish.</p><p>Meanwhile, the label antisemite should generally be avoided and used only after consultation with Standards or senior editors. (Also, be careful to avoid the misspellings antisemetic/antisemetism; the Tansa spell-checker has been programmed to catch this.)</p><p>Labels matter. They can carry assumptions that might be unfair. That is why the Journal and many other publications eschew homophobic or Islamophobic in our own voice (because \"phobic\" assumes a motive that may or may not be there) and instead use antigay or anti-Muslim.</p><p>However, in all cases involving labels applied to people, the important thing is to fully describe a person's words or actions. Describe in our articles, within the bounds of taste, the actions or statements that gave rise to any of these terms, rather than relying on the label.</p><p>The politics of spelling</p><p>We don't trip up on this often, but here's a reminder that Democrat is used only as a noun. Otherwise, use Democratic. So, Democratic Party, a Democratic issue point, a Democratic politician. But: A Democrat won the seat. Some Republicans misuse Democrat as an adjective on purpose (the \"Democrat Party\") to annoy Democrats. The only time we would use that spelling is when quoting someone, if they are intentionally trying to be insulting and it is worth getting that across.</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* We uppercase Parliament in all uses when referring to Britain's body. See the stylebook's entry on legislative bodies outside the U.S.</p><p>* No hyphen in nonbinding and most non– constructions. And no hyphen in megahit and most mega- constructions.</p><p>* Google is lowercase as a verb. She googled the information. Similarly, it is Twitter but: He tweeted about it.</p><p>* We have done a good job of avoiding the 'Tis the season for… cliché in headlines or articles this season. God bless us, everyone.</p><p>* Headline reminders: We generally should use no period at the end of a second sentence in a headline if the first ends in a question mark (Free Coffee for All? That Sounds Good to Workers with no period at the end). And conjunctions such as but and and should be lowercase, with few exceptions, such as being at the start of the line.</p><p>* In gun terminology, clip and magazine sometimes get used interchangeably, even by military people. But as readers pointed out after a recent headline, they aren't the same thing: A clip is a storage device used to load ammunition into the magazine.</p><p>* We sometimes refer to the financial crisis. But we should specify which one. For example, the 2018 financial crisis.</p><p>* Caption reminder for the print edition: It's risky to use a reference to a color (pictured, in red), because you never know when a page will be printed in black and white in some plants.</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"Good Vibrations: Next-Generation Buds,\" ​describing bone-conduction headphones, by Daniel Varghese.</p><p>* \"Contracts Gone Wild: As more companies treat employees like contractors, they get what they ask for, and no more,\" by Larry Rout.</p><p>* \"A Change of Hearth,\" on fireplace trends, by Dale Hrabi.</p><p>* \"Mark Cuban Lands a Job at an Online Pharmacy,\" by Emily Nelson with Erik Holm.</p><p>Notifications above the rest</p><p>Here are some of the top mobile push alerts, both on WSJ's native app and via Apple News. Our aim is to highlight the storytelling our editors do on locked screens, typically in 140 characters or fewer.</p><p>* Employees were left sick with anger, even vomiting. \"One day I hope I can forgive you,\" a lawyer texted the CEO.</p><p>* The newest office status symbol has a $50 price tag—and a long waitlist</p><p>* The old 60-40 method is falling apart. People are lost. \"Everything on the statement is blood red.\"</p><p>* The hottest shoe right now is the \"dad sneaker\"</p><p>* He thought his home might sell for $30 million. Fifteen months later, it's \"the steal of the century.</p><p>Quiz (find the flubs)</p><p>* Led by Sam Bankman-Fried until his resignation last week, FTX's bankruptcy petition was brought on by a liquidity crisis and questions about his leadership.</p><p>* It says the G-20 leaders emphasize \"the full, timely and continued implementation\" of the deal agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations.</p><p>* For one thing, it forced her to start honoring her bodies' needs.</p><p>* Architect Paul McClean crafted a house there with 7,400 square feet above ground and another 12,000 below, including a 3,000-square-foot garage.</p><p>* We asked some notable people who we admire what \"heirloom\" means to them.</p><p>* Mr. Ilmiyev, whom hospital employees said left Kherson with Russian forces, couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>* Have you ever had to tell a client you wouldn't work with them anymore?</p><p>Answers</p><p>* A dangler. The bankruptcy petition wasn't led by Sam Bankman-Fried.</p><p>* Agreed is an intransitive verb, so \"agreed by\" should be: agreed to by.</p><p>* She has more than one body?</p><p>* Make it an additional 12,000. \"Another\" would mean another 7,400.</p><p>* We asked people whom we admire. The usual who/whom trick would have worked: Turn the sentence into a question, and if \"they\" did something, the choice is who. But we admire them, so it calls for whom.</p><p>* This time the choice should have been who. The who/whom trick also works by substituting he or him. Who left? He did, not him. So the choice is who.</p><p>* Our stylebook says the \"singular they\" (or them) isn't good grammar but is acceptable in specific reference to someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns. We can write him or her, rather than them. Or make the whole thing plural: Have you ever had to tell clients you wouldn't work with them anymore?</p><p>Send questions or comments to William Power and Jennifer Hicks.</p><p>ISSN 1054-7041</p><p>Vol. 35, No. 11: Antisemitism</p>",
