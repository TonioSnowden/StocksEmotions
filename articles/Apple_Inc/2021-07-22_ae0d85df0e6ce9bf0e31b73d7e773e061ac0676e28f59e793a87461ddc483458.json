  "title": "U.S. News: FTC Wants to Open Up Repairs of Devices",
  "text": "<p>Manufacturers restrict the repair of their equipment by limiting the availability of parts and repair information, steering consumers to their own repair networks, claiming patent and trademark rights and designing products in ways that make repairs more difficult, according to the FTC.</p><p>Consumer-advocacy groups and repair companies want policy makers to back what they call \"Right to Repair.\" They argue manufacturers in a range of industries, from Apple Inc. smartphones to Deere &amp; Co. tractors, make it too hard for consumers to get the parts and information needed to fix devices. They also say that manufacturers design products in ways that make repairs difficult and restrict competition among repair technicians, which can make fixes more expensive.</p><p>Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the FTC, backed those concerns Wednesday.</p><p>\"These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunities for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, [and] delay timely repairs,\" she said at a virtual public meeting.</p><p>TechNet, a trade association of technology companies whose members include Apple, criticized the FTC decision, saying it was unnecessary and could end up creating new risks to consumers.</p><p>\"Allowing unauthorized third parties with access to sensitive diagnostic information, software, tools, and parts would jeopardize the safety and security of consumers' computers, tablets, and other devices and put them at risk for fraud and data theft,\" said a statement from Carl Holshouser, senior vice president at TechNet. For instance, a repair technician could compromise information on a consumer's smartphone.</p><p>The FTC has brushed aside those arguments. Earlier this year, it unanimously approved a staff report on the repair industry, dubbed \"Nixing the Fix,\" which identified \"no empirical evidence to suggest that independent repair shops are more or less likely than authorized repair shops to compromise or misuse customer data.\"</p><p>Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of the Repair Association, a coalition of repair companies and consumer groups, said: \"The context historically is that we did no enforcement for at least 20 years while all of these manufacturers ran around doing incredibly anticompetitive things, and then doing more, and not being stopped.\"</p><p>\"This is the first in my entire lifetime, and I've been in the tech industry since the 1970s, that the government has done anything.\"</p><p>What precisely the FTC might do isn't known. It has the power to write regulations, but developing those can take years and may face legal challenges. It can bring lawsuits against companies for behavior it deems anticompetitive, unfair or deceptive.</p><p>It also enforces the 1975 Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which generally bars companies from conditioning product warranties on using their brand-name repair services.</p><p>Republicans on the FTC said they support more enforcement, but added that not all repair restrictions are illegal. \"I do not support blanket condemnation of exclusionary design choices,\" said Republican FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson. She noted that sometimes design features benefit consumers even if they make products harder to repair.</p>",
