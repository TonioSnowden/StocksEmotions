  "title": "The Everyday Patriotism of Diverse Democracies; Civic principles matter, but love of country in the modern West is largely based on affection for ordinary life, from food and holiday customs to sports teams and local geography.",
  "text": "<p>But it is precisely because Orwell knew how powerfully such emotions drive politics, and how destructive they can become when they are allowed to fester, that he defended a constructive form of patriotism. \"What has kept England on its feet during the past year?\" he asked. In the main, he answered, it was \"the atavistic emotion of patriotism.\"</p><p>Orwell's ambivalent case for patriotism is of renewed relevance today. When cruise missiles first homed in on their targets in Kyiv, much of the world assumed that Russian troops would soon reach the Ukrainian capital. But to the astonishment of both Western intelligence analysts and the war's architects in the Kremlin, Ukraine has so far managed to resist. Fueled by a collective determination to defend their homeland, however poor the odds, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been able to withstand brutal attacks by a much larger invading force.</p><p>But love of country can go wrong as readily today as it has in the past. In its most aggressive and exclusionary forms, nationalism can lead to the attacks on ethnic and religious outsiders that we have seen in western democracies, or even provide the pretext for one country to annex the territory of another. Vladimir Putin, too, claims to be a patriot.</p><p>So how can defenders of democracy summon the power of patriotism without opening the door to prejudice and chauvinism? And do the citizens of deeply diverse countries like the United States even have enough in common to sustain a meaningful form of collective solidarity?</p><p>The most traditional form of nationalism emphasizes common descent. Advocates of an ethnic conception of patriotism argue that most nations are rooted in the history of particular peoples and should continue to recognize those who descend from its original inhabitants as having special standing.</p><p>But the changes of the past half-century, especially in democracies that experienced a high level of immigration, have made such an ethnic conception of nationalism impractical and destructive. Forever hailing the achievements of one part of the population, ethnic nationalism is unable to acknowledge to what extent most countries are now shaped by immigrants and their descendants. It fails to give members of modern democracies who belong to minority groups full credit for their contributions, making it far more difficult to sustain genuine solidarity in countries undergoing rapid demographic change.</p><p>Philosophers and politicians who recognize that ethnic nationalism cannot provide a sensible basis for a diverse democracy, but don't want to give up on patriotism altogether, usually make the case for a time-tested alternative: civic patriotism. To be proud to be an American, they say, is to love the ideals and institutions to which the country committed itself in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p><p>The advantages of civic patriotism are significant. Unlike ethnic nationalism, it allows anybody who is willing to embrace a set of shared political values to become a full member of the community. So long as immigrants from such different places as Morocco, Thailand, Zimbabwe and El Salvador agree to abide by the Constitution, they should be able to live together in peace—and become as American as a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant whose forefathers arrived on these shores hundreds of years ago.</p><p>There is also some reason to think that civic patriotism is less likely to draw countries into international conflict than ethnic forms of nationalism. A love of country that is based in a belief in the inherent superiority of one's own ethnic or racial group provides an easy excuse for those who want to dismiss the legitimate interests of other nations. But a nation that is founded on the importance of self-determination should be able to recognize that other countries also have a legitimate interest in ruling themselves. Civic patriotism should be better able than ethnic nationalism to welcome newcomers into the fold and sustain meaningful international cooperation.</p><p>For all of those reasons, the idea of civic patriotism strongly appeals to me. It defines nations by their highest ideals rather than their basest instincts. And it gives citizens a way to take pride in their country without indulging in bigotry or chauvinism. If I didn't hesitate to swear an oath of citizenship when I became an American citizen five years ago, it is, in part, because I love the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and the inspiration they have provided for civic patriotism, both at home and abroad.</p><p>Even so, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that civic patriotism is at best a partial answer to the question of how contemporary democracies can sustain a common national identity. Patriotism is one of the most universal sentiments in the modern world. Most citizens of democracies feel it at least to some extent. But an interest in high-flown civic ideals and civic documents remains the preserve of a politically minded minority.</p><p>Noble though the idea may be, civic patriotism will never fully describe what most people feel when they think of their country with love or affection. In putting abstract political principles at the center of our collective sentiments, the notion of civic patriotism runs the danger of mischaracterizing a sentiment that is, at least as much, about our emotional attachment to real people and places. We need to complement the civic conception of patriotism with another dimension—one which recognizes the key role played by everyday culture.</p><p>In 1993 John Major, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, delivered a speech to reassure his country that a closer relationship with Europe wouldn't alter its essential character. Even if parliament ratified the Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union, he said, Britain would \"still be the country of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers.\"</p><p>The speech was widely mocked: The idea that warm beer would forever define Britain seemed silly to many of his compatriots. Major's failure is no aberration. Whenever politicians try to define the nature of their country, they end up sounding cheesy, antiquated or both. It would be easy to conclude that these smart politicians and their well-paid speechwriters keep failing because they are trying to give voice to something that doesn't exist.</p><p>Yet as someone who has lived in five different countries, I am daily struck by the extent to which national cultures continue to differ from one another. Even in the European Union, where borders between member states have almost disappeared, nations continue to shape the \"cultural scripts\" that, as the sociologists Cliff Goddard and Anna Wierzbicka put it, set \"background norms, templates, guidelines or models for ways of thinking, acting, feeling, and speaking.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What aspects of ordinary life make you feel patriotic? Join the conversation below.</p><p>When people say that they love their country, they aren't necessarily celebrating the ethnic links that unite members of the majority group. Nor need they be thinking about politics or the constitution. While politicians might, for lack of better words, invoke a lot of clichés or historical symbols when making patriotic speeches, most people arrive at their cultural patriotism by a more direct and unpretentious route. Their love of country is deeply imbued with their appreciation of its everyday sights and smells and sounds and tastes. Their affection is for the things that make up everyday life: their fields and cities, dishes and customs, buildings and cultural scripts.</p><p>There is a way to invoke culture that excludes newcomers and minority groups, that values purity over inclusion. For cultural traditionalists, Italy would cease being Italy if a greater number of Italians chose not to celebrate Christmas, and India would cease being India if most Indians started to celebrate Halloween. But in a diverse democracy, culture bears the mark of many different groups. When asked about their favorite foods, Germans are now more likely to mention a \"foreign\" dish like spaghetti Bolognese or Döner kebab than they are to go on about a \"local\" dish like Schweinshaxe. And when Americans think about dishes they love, they are as likely to list pizza and tacos as they are to talk about meat loaf or apple pie.</p><p>This living, breathing, ever-changing everyday culture is open to immigrants and ethnic minorities. Though minority groups often retain pride in elements of their ancestral culture, the vast majority of them are, simultaneously, perfectly comfortable with the cultural mainstream. In most diverse democracies, members of ethnic or religious minorities are among the most fervent fans of local sports teams and celebrities. They keenly celebrate nondenominational holidays like Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve. In some places, they are even appropriating the most traditional and stereotypical aspects of national culture for themselves: Scots of Indian extraction have taken to the kilt in considerable numbers, for example, while Bavarians with Turkish roots are increasingly likely to don lederhosen when they go to the Oktoberfest.</p><p>Skeptics may ask why anyone should love the culture of a particular modern nation state when all nations increasingly resemble one another, contain a lot of variety within their own borders, and suffer from serious injustices. But when someone says that they love Brazil or Indonesia or the U.S., they don't mean that their attributes are unique, that there is nothing wrong with them, or that other countries are terrible. They are simply expressing a special affection for what is theirs.</p><p>As a German Jew whose ancestors perished in the Holocaust, I find that patriotism doesn't come naturally to me. But for diverse democracies like the U.S. to thrive, citizens of many different ethnic and religious groups need to sustain a real sense of solidarity with one another.</p><p>Many countries in the world are now in the middle of a contentious debate about how much commonality of spirit they can hope for. Some voices on the right claim that immigration and demographic change are destroying social cohesion. They believe that the historical success of countries like the U.S. depended on the religion or even the ethnicity of the majority group and will inevitably erode as a result of its relative decline. Meanwhile, some voices on the left believe that the citizens of modern nations will forever be defined, first and foremost, by their religion or ethnicity. To hope that \"whites\" and \"people of color\" could subordinate their differences to a shared national identity, they say, is to be naive about the enduring force of racism.</p><p>It is easy to see why this kind of pessimism is now in fashion. Deep racial injustices undoubtedly endure in virtually all countries. And with the share of residents born outside America higher than it has been at any point in living memory, cultural differences between immigrants and natives really can feel especially stark. Even so, it would be a dangerous mistake to overlook how much Americans who belong to different ethnic and religious groups have in common—or to give up on a future in which they might come to feel an even deeper kinship.</p><p>Mr. Mounk is a professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University.
