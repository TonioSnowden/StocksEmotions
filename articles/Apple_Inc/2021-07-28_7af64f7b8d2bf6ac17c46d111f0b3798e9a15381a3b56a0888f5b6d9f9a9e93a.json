  "text": "<p> A trinity of trillion-dollar tech companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18cfeb9a-8596-4d23-badd-df9a62d510ab\">proved overnight </a>the incredible extent to which Big Tech was prospering in the pandemic, due to the trends of remote working, online purchasing and buying the gadgets that make those connections possible.</p> <p>In earnings for their June quarters, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft benefited respectively from increased hardware sales, a digital advertising boom and the growth in demand for cloud services.</p> <p>The three brought in combined after-tax profits of almost $5bn a week. At $56.8bn for the quarter, the total was almost double the year before and 30 per cent more than Wall Street had predicted. They generated a combined $189.4bn in revenue — 39 per cent more than the same period the year before, and some $15bn more than Wall Street had been expecting.</p> <p>The figures were “absolutely stunning”, said Jim Tierney, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, adding that “digital advertising is just on fire”, as advertisers race to follow audiences who have turned to online services in huge numbers. “I think the takeaway is, all the digital habits that we picked up over the past 12 months, they're going to stick with us when we come out of this,” he added. </p> <p>Facebook results after the market close today and Amazon's on Thursday should confirm the trend.</p> <p>Sales of&#xa0;Apple's iPhones&#xa0;jumped 50 per cent, while&#xa0;Google's advertising&#xa0;sales soared 69 per cent from a year earlier. Growth at Microsoft's Azure&#xa0;cloud platform re-accelerated to more than 50 per cent.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d6c38a1-9e32-45a2-b8f4-018f57d9f794\">Alphaville says</a> the three are defying the axiom in business analysis that the larger a company gets, the slower its growth, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e324c41-1c7c-4e96-86d2-c8a7f2db8b58\">Lex argues </a>the blowout earnings are sustainable beyond the pandemic. This would please investors no end, but give regulators fresh ammunition for monopoly investigations into how a handful of tech companies have come to dominate our digital world.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Shopify sees no shopping drop</strong><br>Ahead of Amazon's results, Shopify has predicted that online retail will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a876506-bb2d-4abd-9496-860820079d39\">continue to show strong growth </a>through the rest of this year, even as physical stores reopen in the US and Europe. The Canadian online shopfront provider reported its first $1bn quarter and finance chief Amy Shapero told analysts: “We do believe [ecommerce spending] has reset at a higher level and is now just growing at a more normalised level.”</p> <p><strong>2. LG displays caution on TV panels</strong><br>We may be going out more and watching TV less post-pandemic, leading to LG Display warning it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bc36981-89f4-41c5-a424-4973c0756683\">bracing for lower prices</a> in the second half on reduced demand for TVs. The world's second-biggest maker of display panels reported an operating profit of Won701bn ($606m) in the second quarter as sales jumped 31 per cent year on year.</p> <p><strong>3. Wall St panics over China stocks&#xa0;<br></strong>The value of Chinese shares on Wall Street has soared to $2tn over the past two decades as investors turned a blind eye to the precarious legal structure known as a variable interest entity (VIE) underpinning many of the country's biggest US listings. But a ban on tutoring companies using the structure has triggered fears that other VIEs could be hit, such as Alibaba, Pinduoduo and JD.com, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38ba7bb9-9a7e-4817-80cf-324bc9a4527b\">report our markets teams.</a></p> <p><strong>4. UK's chip options are wafer-thin</strong><br>The UK government's sudden concern about the foreign takeover of Newport Wafer Fab in Wales seems driven by the realisation that Britain is being left behind in the race to secure a reliable supply chain for the latest semiconductors. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8506cad-2f3e-4ac0-adb2-d5f652f89563\">Jim Pickard and Tim Bradshaw report</a> a review is under way of the UK's strategy, as the US and EU forge ahead with their own plans to reduce dependence on Asian chipmakers.</p> <p><strong>5. Biden warns cyber attacks can mean real war</strong><br>Joe Biden has warned that cyber attacks could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bbaa89b-2e85-4c5f-b918-566e6712d273\">escalate into a full-blown war</a>, as tensions with Russia and China mount over hacking incidents. “If we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach,” he said in a speech. Meanwhile in India, there is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd4de67a-b7c2-426c-9ed0-549be144763d\">concern about the implications</a> of government hacking of journalists and public figures using NSO's Pegasus spyware.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Nokia's rugged XR20</h2> <p>HMD Global, the maker of Nokia-branded phones, has come up with its first ruggedised “life-proof” smartphone. <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/nokia-xr-20\">The XR20</a> is built to military-grade standards and has a three-year warranty and one-year free screen replacement. It can withstand extreme temperatures, 1.8m drops and an hour under water. There are 48MP and 13MP dual cameras with Zeiss Optics, as well as 5G speeds and 15W wireless charging. It's available now for pre-order in the UK from £399 in a 64GB version and comes to the US on August 24 as a 128GB version for $550.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Big Tech trio's triumphant quarters' FT.com 28 July.
