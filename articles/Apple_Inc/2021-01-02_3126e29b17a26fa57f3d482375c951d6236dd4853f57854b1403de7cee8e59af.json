  "text": "<p>When Kenneth Grahame's mole sits for the first time by the river in&#xa0;<em>The Wind and the Willows</em>, what he hears is “a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea”.<br><br>For British photographer Chloe Dewe Mathews, the tales told by the Thames are just as enchanting. In a new exhibition, she traces its course from source to sea, uncovering the people and practices on its waters that otherwise might slip by unnoticed: mudlarks picking through the banks for treasure; the annual royal census of its swans; even a druid in a homemade coracle, delighting like Grahame's water rat in simply messing about in boats.</p> <p><em>‘Thames Log' is co-published by Loose Joints and Martin Parr Foundation and will be showing at the Martin Parr Foundation in summer 2021</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
