  "title": "The Greatest Beer Run Ever film review — a fizzy, yeasty brew",
  "text": "<p>In the 1990s, writer/director Peter Farrelly used to make gloriously crude but original comedies such as <em>Dumb and Dumber</em> and <em>There's Something About Mary</em>. Now he makes Films about Issues. With 2018's <em>Green Book</em>, he hit on an Oscar-winning formula in which a working-class white guy learns to question his assumptions about x while on a road trip through y, in period setting z. While in that film x = racism, y = the American South and z = the early 1960s, this time Farrelly has substituted the key variables for the Vietnam war, south-east Asia and the late 1960s to arrive at <em>The Greatest Beer Run Ever</em>.</p> <p>The regular guy cruising for a bruising epiphany this time is Chickie Donohue (a serviceable Zac Efron), sometime Merchant Marine from a tight Catholic community in New York. Chickie has drunk the beer-flavoured Kool-Aid and believes that the US military is on a righteous mission in Vietnam to prevent the spread of communism. So do all his buddies at the bar run by grizzled second world war veteran The Colonel (Bill Murray).</p> <p>To show support, Chickie quixotically decides to board a merchant ship heading to Vietnam so he can bring some beers to his buds on the front. However, what he finds in south-east Asia is not a well-oiled military machine but a profoundly rusty contraption. A little slow on the uptake, Chickie eventually grasps just how bad things are after witnessing enough suffering, cruelty, disinformation and absurd destruction, symbolised with heavy-hoofed emphasis by a stampede of wounded elephants running away from a napalm attack.</p> <p>The script, based on a true story, is pocked with a cluster-bomb of clichés, from Russell Crowe's gruff war correspondent to the nice and therefore clearly doomed traffic cop (Kevin K Tran) who helps Chickie find his way across Saigon. Yet there is an undeniable brio in the way this picaresque unfolds, thanks to nimble editing and the sucker-punches of a few well-chosen needle-drops. In the end, much like the seemingly feather-light yet bottomless duffel bag full of cans that Chickie lugs around, the film lacks heft but keeps producing a fizzy, yeasty brew.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>In cinemas and on Apple TV Plus from September 30</em></p><p>Source: Leslie Felperin 2022 'The Greatest Beer Run Ever film review — a fizzy, yeasty brew' FT.com 29 September.
