  "title": "My night with Frank Lloyd Wright",
  "text": "<p>As the US reckons with its very character in the wake of national tumult, I keep alighting on one of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Frank_Lloyd_Wright\">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>'s favoured words: “Usonian”.</p> <p>America's most famous architect popularised the adjective as his take on the country's architectural quintessence. It meant something specific to the US but, unlike most versions of American exceptionalism, it was defiantly small, quirky and respectful of its surroundings. No sweeping staircases for him, no empire-building columns, no grandiose ceilings and, most stridently of all, no box.</p> <p>“I have, life-long, been fighting the pull of the specious old box,” Wright said in a 1952 address to young American architects — the box in question being that formed by the floor, walls and ceiling of conventional rooms, themselves stacked to form a bigger box, the house. For Wright, this was about more than just a fondness for open-plan interiors — the box was a “square package of containment . . . Something not fit for our liberal profession of democratic government, a thing essentially anti-individual”.</p> <p>What better escape then, in a year characterised by containment, than to stay in a house designed by Wright himself? Though the architect designed more than 1,000 buildings, and more than 500 were built, fewer than 60 are open to the public today, and there are only a handful that you can rent and have to yourself for the night. For this, I have come to Pennsylvania's <a href=\"https://www.polymathpark.com/\">Polymath Park</a>, an architectural haven amid the forests of Westmoreland County, created by Tom and Heather Papinchak. </p> <p>The couple hadn't planned to become architectural historians, but when the 130-acre plot beside their house came up for sale, they bought it to prevent it going to developers. Already there among the hemlocks were two 1960s homes designed by Wright disciple Peter Berndtson. The Papinchaks went on to painstakingly relocate and rebuild two 1950s Usonian Wright homes brick by brick — the Duncan house, which came from Illinois and which they opened to the public in 2007, and the Mäntylä house from Minnesota, which opened in 2019. Architecture fans can now tour the houses by day — often in combination with a pilgrimage to Fallingwater, the cantilevered forest mansion 18 miles to the south that is perhaps Wright's most famous building — and a few lucky ones can stay the night.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We're just kind of two regular people preserving history,” Heather tells me as we chat on the outdoor deck of what was once her home, before the couple decided to move out to make way for their new project. It is now the park's Treetops restaurant, where overnight guests and locals can dine. (Cooking inside the museum-piece houses is prohibited because of the fire risk, although they are equipped with microwaves.) As the project has grown, she has thrown herself into studying Wright, meeting members of his family and teaming up with architecture students. “Some people think he's pompous; I think he's fascinating. The intention was that the everyday American could live in [an environment like this], be inspired by nature, be inspired by the house.</p> <p>“You have to see the light move through the house the way Frank Lloyd Wright intended,” she tells me. The thought of spending a day doing nothing but watching shafts of sunlight move through continuous space — Wright's defining concept for even his smallest of one-storey homes — is an alluring prospect.</p> <p>My small group tour starts in Wright's Duncan House. Stooping under a low door, I am delivered straight to a 1957 kitchen with a hob with buttons that look like they might launch Sputnik. Bleached mahogany veneer, red Formica, a sunken living room and cork floors complete the spell — and in the bathroom I spy a vintage pink hairdryer, a hint at the technological optimism of the 1950s. Everywhere you look are horizontal lines, created by shaped wooden battens on the interior and exterior walls and in raised sections of limestone in the kitchen. They seem to unite the space. “The&#xa0;horizontal line&#xa0;is the&#xa0;line&#xa0;of&#xa0;domesticity,” said Wright. </p> <p>A short drive through the woods brings us to Balter House, designed by Berndtson in 1964. It has all the pizzazz of a stout shed from the front, but opens up to reveal a huge fireplace of local stone and a living area of glass and wood on stone stilts that overhangs the ferns outside. It is transporting: even the air feels green. In an act of originality, or perhaps of rebellion, gone are the horizontal lines: the beams, wood panels and window struts rendered by Wright's protégé throughout the house are all verticals.</p> <p>Last on the tour, down another forest lane, is Mäntylä, where I am to return at 5pm when all the day-trippers have gone. I won't have long: checkout is at 10am, so it can be cleaned before the daily group tours. The house is filled with light but I barely want to look yet, eager instead to tiptoe back with a key of my own after the rest of the visitors depart. A few hours of wandering the forest lanes later, the moment of return at last arrives. </p> <p>From the front, the outside of Mäntylä, Wright's 1952 design for Emma and Ray Lindholm, resembles a white concrete bunker, scored with horizontal lines. A row of small square windows along the top of one outer wall recalls gun ports. This is typical: Wright wanted to give his family homes a low public profile from the front, while opening up the backs to let light, views of the natural environment — and a sense of freedom — flood in. </p> <p>And so it goes. Inside, I find myself in an open-plan, L-shaped, single-storey space, characteristic of the Usonian homes Wright envisaged for Middle America. The rear is almost all glazed, looking out on to the trees (Mäntylä means “of the pines” in Finnish). The red roof, which seems almost flat at the front, soars upwards at the back, forming a triangle over one corner, like a bird taking flight.&#xa0;Large red floor tiles continue into the outside space beyond the windows, creating a terrace that blends inside and out — the box seemingly exploded. </p> <p>I unpack in the master bedroom, full of warm-hued cypress panelling and with a bed looking straight into the woods, then settle beside the big fireplace. I'm tentative at first. My lip-stained mug, on Frank Lloyd Wright's diagonal dining tables, feels scandalous. I open cupboard doors in search of I have no idea what.</p> <p>Wright was famously controlling of his clients, but he liked relatively modest commissions from America's middle classes, even though he was no ascetic himself. (On once recovering from pneumonia his first wish was for “speckled trout and a glass of champagne”, according to one of his daughters.) By the time he died in 1959, aged 91, he had designed about 130 of these Usonian family homes over 25 years.</p> <p>After supper at Treetops, I return to the house with a slice of cake squirrelled away to spend much of the evening living out Wright's 1958 essay “Democracy in overalls”, in which he wrote that “quiet repose” would appeal to his Usonian dwellers.</p> <p>Wright played with the notion of compression and release, creating head-bobbing, claustrophobia-inducing tight spaces before forcing you forwards into a surge of expansive freedom and creativity. He regularly creates constriction with overhangs and low ceilings (he was 5ft 8in himself and liked to say he designed at “the human scale”), inducing physical tension before relieving it with the sudden shock of space. The sharpest experience of this comes with Mäntylä's office. You approach it via a tight corridor with wood panels to one side and concrete on the other, again scored with horizontal lines, before emerging into a room that better recalls a submarine than an office. Magnetised to sit on a low chair at a desk set against a small window on to the trees, I find myself in front of a typewriter with an urge to write. He has made physical the very tonic of concentration.</p> <p>I go to bed early, expecting to wake with dawn in my curtainless room. But the eastern sun is hidden from view, and instead I wake unexpectedly late to ambient light. On the day's agenda are visits to two other Wright designs in the Laurel Highlands: Kentuck Knob, a 1956 luxury home built into a hill that is a homily to the hexagon, and Fallingwater itself, a cascade of rectangles built 20 years earlier.&#xa0;</p> <p>For now, though, there is time to linger a little with the calming view of my own private, natural courtyard backed by oak, cherry and maple trees.&#xa0;If Wright's architecture creates a sense of release, so too does a night in these Pennsylvania woods.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/katrina-manson\"><em>Katrina Manson</em></a><em> is the FT's US Foreign Policy and Defence Correspondent</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
