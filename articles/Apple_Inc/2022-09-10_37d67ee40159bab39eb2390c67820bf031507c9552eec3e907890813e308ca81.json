  "title": "U.S. News:  Buyback  Tax Seen  Raising  Billions  ----  By Theo Francis and Mark Maurer",
  "text": "<p>   The 1% tax on stock buybacks signed into law last month would have raised about $8.4 billion from the biggest publicly traded U.S. companies if it had been in effect last year, absorbing the equivalent of nearly a half-percentage-point of net income overall, a new analysis finds. </p><p>   The financial impact would have been similar to raising the combined effective tax rate for the companies to 17.95% from 17.56%, according to financial data firm S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which analyzed the buybacks for companies in the S&amp;P 500 index. </p><p>   The buyback tax, which goes into effect Jan. 1, is expected to raise $74 billion in federal revenue over a decade, the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has projected. </p><p>   Share repurchases by S&amp;P 500 companies reached a record in the first quarter, at $281 billion, surpassing the previous peaks of $223 billion in late 2018 and $270 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. </p><p>   Preliminary data show S&amp;P 500 buybacks in the second quarter declined about 19% from the first quarter as worries grew that the economy could slow significantly, but remained above second-quarter 2021 levels, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. \"The additional tax will not have a material impact on buybacks,\" he predicted. </p><p>   The new excise tax -- a last-minute addition to Democratic legislation intended to help pay for spending on climate, healthcare and other initiatives -- is levied on net buybacks, or repurchases offset by new share issuance. </p><p>   Based on their 2021 buybacks, the cost to real-estate companies would have been less than 0.1% of income, while the tax bill for tech and communications-services companies would have reached about 0.7% of income for the year. </p><p>   Apple Inc. would have paid nearly $900 million in taxes on its net buybacks of $87.7 billion if the tax had been in effect last year, while Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. would have paid about $500 million apiece, the analysis found. </p><p>   Four other companies would have seen a tax bill of between $250 million and $275 million on last year's buybacks, including Microsoft Corp., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Bank of America Corp., the data suggest. </p><p></p>",
