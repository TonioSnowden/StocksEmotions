  "title": "Neil Young wants to remove his music from Spotify over Joe Rogan's ‘disinformation'",
  "text": "<p>In an open letter to his management and record label, first reported by Rolling Stone on Monday, Young said Spotify Technology SA SPOT can have “Rogan or Young. Not both.”</p><p>&#xa0;“I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines — potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” Young wrote. “Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule.”</p><p>Rogan's podcast was Spotify's most popular worldwide in 2021, despite criticism that it spreads COVID misinformation and conspiracy theories, and gives a platform to far-right figures.</p><p>Last month, a group of 270 figures from the medical and scientific community decried Rogan's show and called on Spotify to institute a misinformation policy.</p><p>“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine,” they wrote in an open letter. “This is not only a scientific or medical concern; it is a sociological issue of devastating proportions and Spotify is responsible for allowing this activity to thrive on its platform.”</p><p>Young took his music off Spotify once before, in 2015, when he complained about the sound quality of the streaming-music service and switched to Tidal. He returned his catalog to Spotify, Apple AAPL Music and other services in 2016.</p>",
