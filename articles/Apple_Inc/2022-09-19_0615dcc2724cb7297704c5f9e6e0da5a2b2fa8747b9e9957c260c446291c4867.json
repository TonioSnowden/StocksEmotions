  "text": "<p>Greetings from New York, where the Big Apple is about to be overwhelmed by the frenzy that is the United Nations General Assembly and Climate Week — not to forget the Clinton Global Initiative and Bloomberg climate summit, as well. Locals love to <em>kvetch</em> about the horrors of the traffic jams, police helicopters and sirens. But we are thrilled to see people back in real life, and on Sunday night Moral Money even took a step that was unimaginable a year ago — we threw a lively late-night party with Valerie Keller's <a href=\"https://imagine.one/\">Imagine</a> to celebrate UNGA week. Read on for some of the gossip from last night at the end of the note. </p> <p>We'll be publishing Monday to Friday this week to capture all the news — and expect plenty of it given that there are <a href=\"https://ungaguide.com/events/photo/page/11/\">hundreds of events</a> happening at the UN and around the edges. So check out our list below of the top five themes to watch — and the smart survival guide to the frenzy. </p> <h1>Top themes to watch</h1> <h2>1. The big ESG backlash — and backlash to the backlash </h2> <p>When Moral Money was first established back in 2019 (remember those pre-Covid days; we barely do) Greta Thunberg, the teenage activist, and Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, were dominating headlines. The former was terrorising middle-aged chief executives into caring (or pretending to care) about the climate; the latter was whipping up investor action. Now, however, the energy crisis is sparking a backlash. Republicans in America are at the forefront of this. But the new UK government of Liz Truss is echoing some of these themes. So how far will the backlash be on display at UNGA Week? And how effective is the swelling backlash-to-backlash now? And - most importantly - to what degree will this backlash deter chief executives from speaking out on these themes? We suspect the answer is quite a bit.</p> <h2>2. The fights raging inside the GFANZ</h2> <p>Don't yawn: as Moral Money has often written, a crucial set of initiatives have got under way in the past two years in the audit, reporting and regulatory sectors to embed sustainability issues into the corporate and financial world. The alphabet soup around them is ghastly, with new (but potentially valuable) additions such as the International Sustainability Standards Board. But the one to watch this week is the “GFANZ” — Glasgow Financial Alliance for New Zero — which was created in November 2021 by a coalition led by people such as Mark Carney, Mike Bloomberg and Mary Schapiro. The group is supposed to be urging — or forcing — financiers to impose green standards. But the UN has recently tightened these standards and not all the GFANZ members are onboard. Indeed, some gigantic institutions are so unhappy they are threatening to leave. Watch closely to see whether the UN blinks first and waters down the targets — or whether any big Wall Street groups flounce out. </p> <h2>3. Developing nations rise up </h2> <p>The devastating floods in Pakistan this month have hammered home a truth that rich campaigners often ignore: the biggest victims of climate change are in the developing world. But thus far, the rich countries have paid a hugely insufficient amount to help developing countries adapt their economies to a warming world — let alone offset all the losses. This has unsurprisingly stoked rising fury and is now threatening to poison the next big climate change discussions, COP27 in Egypt this November. Watch to see how much anger is on display this week — and where this threatens to go.</p> <h2>4. The future of US-China relations </h2> <p>US-Chinese relations have hit a new nadir in recent months, dramatically complicating efforts to get any joint climate initiatives. Now, President Xi Jinping is determined to boost the economy before the all-important Party Congress next month, so he is grabbing energy from (almost) any source. This is threatening to throw any global effort to curb emissions off the track. But John Kerry, US climate envoy, has been frantically shuttling around the world in a desperate bid to cut some deals. So watch to see if there is any hint of a detente between US and China — and how India responds, or what countries such as Indonesia (which is hosting the key Group of Twenty summit in Bali just before COP-27) might do. And looking at US-China relations, and the rising tensions there, remember that the Securities and Exchange Commission recently cut a surprising deal with Beijing over the audit of Chinese companies. That suggests that sometimes technical collaboration is still possible — even amid the diplomatic shadowboxing,</p> <h2>5. Green gold (or greed)</h2> <p>In the past year, billions of dollars of western investment has moved into new funds that want to back sustainable start-ups, or carve-outs — much of which is focused on renewable energy and other forms of tech and bioscience-inspired innovation. So watch to see where the smart money will be prowling around the UN this week, to work out where some of this tsunami of cash will head next. Top tips? Methane mitigation, biodegradable plastics, carbon capture, regenerative agriculture and nuclear are all sparking tremendous excitement among people we have spoken to recently. But that list is far from exhaustive — and, if nothing else, indicates that the green transition in finance will be driven by greed, as much as fear. </p> <p>Of course, this list is not exhaustive and we would love to hear from you about what you think Moral Money needs to be tracking. Patrick and Gillian will be running around this week in New York, and Simon is catching up on the reaction elsewhere, so do email us at <a href=\"mailto:moralmoneyreply@ft.com\">moralmoneyreply@ft.com</a>. Meanwhile, don't forget our survival tips for emerging from the frenzy in a reasonably good mood: bike everywhere you can since you will travel faster, and emerge with a smug moral glow; pace yourself, since you cannot possibly attend everything; make room to collide with the unexpected or talk to someone outside your world; don't drink (too much); and don't carry (too many) old-fashioned cards, since they are sooooo 20th century; QR codes are all the rage. Enjoy!</p> <p>PS: And the gossip? At last night's party we heard rumors that another global billionaire is about to follow Patagonia's founders by making a dramatic green commitment this week (watch this space - this could come in the next few days). . .plus some hot debate about what will happen to the Prince of Wales' environmental initiatives now that he is King Charles III . . . muttering about the fact that so many world leaders are arriving late to UNGA this year because they are attending the Queen's funeral . . . discussion about whether any CEOs are going to stick their heads above the parapet on green issues this year (the new trend is that they prefer to move as a pack to shield themselves against the backlash) . . . speculation about whether the crowd at COP27 will be a lot smaller than COP26 was in Glasgow . . . and that is just for Sunday. Please tell us any more tips — the week has only just begun. <em>(Gillian Tett)</em></p> <h1>Smart read</h1> <p>Nicolai Tangen, the head of Norway's $1.2tn sovereign wealth fund, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0067d64-dcf2-47b4-a19b-a6b6debd16c5\">has told</a> our Oslo-based colleague Richard Milne that he sees a “real danger” that the backlash in the US against ESG, against a backdrop of surging inflation and energy market turmoil, could push sustainability issues down investors' agenda.</p><p>Source: Gillian Tett  2022 'UNGA Week: what to watch and our top survival tips' FT.com 19 September.
