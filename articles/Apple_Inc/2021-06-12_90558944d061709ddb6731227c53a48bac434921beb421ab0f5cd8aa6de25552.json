  "title": "Bills Aim  To Split  Amazon,  Curb Tech  Giants  ---  Five bipartisan House  proposals seek to  lessen the power of  tech's biggest players  ----  By Dana Mattioli and Ryan Tracy",
  "text": "<p>   House lawmakers proposed a raft of bipartisan legislation aimed at reining in the country's biggest tech companies, including a bill that seeks to make Amazon.com Inc. and other large corporations effectively split in two or shed their private-label products. </p><p>   The bills, announced Friday, amount to the biggest congressional broadside yet on a handful of technology companies -- including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. as well as Amazon -- whose size and power have drawn growing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and Europe. </p><p>   If the bills become law -- a prospect that faces significant hurdles -- they could substantially alter the most richly valued companies in America and reshape an industry that has extended its impact into nearly every facet of work and life. </p><p>   One of the measures, titled the Ending Platform Monopolies Act, seeks to require structural separation of Amazon and other big technology companies to break up their businesses. It would make it unlawful for an online platform to own a business that \"utilizes the covered platform for the sale or provision of products or services\" or that sells services as a condition for access to the platform. The platform company also couldn't own businesses that have conflicts of interest, such as by creating the \"incentive and ability\" for the platform to advantage its own products over competitors. </p><p>   A separate bill takes a different approach, barring platforms from conduct that \"advantages the covered platform operator's own products, services, or lines of business over those of another business user,\" or that excludes or disadvantages other businesses. </p><p>   The proposed legislation would need to be passed by the Democratic-controlled House as well as the Senate, where it would likely also need substantial Republican support. Each of the bills has both Republicans and Democrats signed onto it, with more expected to join, congressional aides said. </p><p>   \"Unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy,\" said Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.), the top Democrat on the House Antitrust Subcommittee. \"They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers, and put folks out of work.\" </p><p>   Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.), the panel's top Republican, said he supports the bill because it \"breaks up Big Tech's monopoly power to control what Americans see and say online, and fosters an online market that encourages innovation.\" </p><p>   The four companies didn't comment Friday. All have defended their competitive practices and said that they operate to benefit customers. </p><p>   Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, whose members include Facebook, Amazon and Google, said the bills, \"Writing regulations for a handful of businesses will skew competition and leave consumers worse off.\" </p><p>   Critics of the technology giants praised the bills. Roku Inc., said lawmakers for took \"a crucial step toward curbing the predatory and anticompetitive behaviors of some of the country's most powerful companies.\" </p><p>   Gaining sufficient GOP support for the bills will be an uphill battle. While Republicans are concerned about tech companies' power, many are skeptical about changing antitrust laws. Even if they pass, the laws could take years to implement over the companies' likely legal objections. </p><p>   \"The fact that there is Day One support from Republican antitrust leaders suggests these bills are definitely in the doable range,\" said Paul Gallant, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Co. \"But the gap between sounding tough at a hearing and actually voting for a break-up is significant. I do wonder if these bills can get to 60 [votes] in the Senate.\" </p><p>   Of the five bills announced Friday, another would force online platforms to make their services interoperable with those of competitors, which could mean different social networks must allow their users to communicate or allow e-commerce sellers to export their customer reviews from one site to another, according to a summary provided by lawmakers. </p><p>   A fourth bill targets mergers, making it unlawful for a large platform to acquire rivals or potential rivals. The bill would have prevented only \"a small percentage of all technology sector deals\" over the past decade, the summary said. </p><p>   Lawmakers also introduced a bill to raise filing fees for mergers valued more than $1 billion and lower them for transactions under $500,000. It would generate an estimated $135 million for antitrust enforcement in its first year, the summary said. Similar legislation recently passed the Senate. </p><p>   Four of the five bills focus on big tech companies: The targeted companies must have a market capitalization of $600 billion or more, more than 50 million active monthly users or 100,000 monthly active business users, and be a \"critical trading partner\" that has the ability to restrict or impede another business' access to customers or services. Only Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google meet those parameters currently, according to the person familiar with the matter. </p><p>   While the bills don't name any companies, they reflect frequent criticisms leveled at tech giants. For example, Amazon operates one of the world's largest platforms for third-party sellers to hawk their goods, but also competes against these vendors with its business selling similar products under its own in-house brands -- often priced below items from third-party sellers. </p><p>   Some lawmakers have said that the platform favors Amazon's own goods at the detriment to sellers and have rebuked Amazon's use of third-party data to inform its own line of private-label goods. Last year, the Journal reported about Amazon employees using the third-party data of sellers on its website to launch its own private-label lines, violating an internal policy. </p><p>   Amazon later opened an investigation into the practice. When testifying to Congress, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said: \"I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\" </p><p>   If the Ending Platform Monopolies bill were to be passed, Amazon could have to split its business into two separate websites, one for its third-party marketplace and one for first-party, or divest or shut down the sale of its own products. Amazon's private-label division has dozens of brands with 158,000 products. </p><p></p>",
