  "text": "<p>From the archives (November 2020):Capitol Report: Biden says U.S. is ‘strongest when it works with its allies' while introducing nominees</p><p>The acknowledgment of such concerns about how the nation's spy agencies choose what information to keep secret under various classification levels is among the most significant by a president's sitting intelligence chief, government transparency advocates said, and could indicate broader interest in the Biden administration for loosening restrictive access to some of the government's growing collection of secrets.</p><p>From the archives (May 2020):Trump DNI nominee Ratcliffe tells Senate panel he wouldn't politicize intelligence</p><p>From the archives (May 2020):Ratcliffe faces Senate panel nine months after Trump abandoned initial plan to make him director of national intelligence</p><p>“It is my view that deficiencies in the current classification system undermine our national security, as well as critical democratic objectives, by impeding our ability to share information in a timely manner” with allies, policy makers and the public, Haines wrote in a letter earlier this month to Sens. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, and Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, which was reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The letter was in response to an October request for information from the senators, who have pushed for overhauls of the declassification system to assist federal agencies struggling to process a large volume of secret information that is no longer sensitive, such as backlogged historical records Congress has said must be released. Wyden and Moran have said classification costs taxpayers about $18.5 billion annually.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.</p><p>Trending at WSJ.com:</p><p>What does Russia want with Ukraine?
