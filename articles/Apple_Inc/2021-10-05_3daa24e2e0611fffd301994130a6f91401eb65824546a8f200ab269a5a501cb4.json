  "text": "<p>“While the long standing bears will continue to yell fire into a crowded theater on a 20 bps move in the 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, we instead focus on the $2 trillion digital transformation opportunity across the enterprise and consumer ecosystem over the coming years that is on tech's doorstep,” he said in a note to clients.</p><p>“While the valuation debate will continue to be front and center in a rising rate environment, we fundamentally believe the Street is massively underestimating what the tech growth picture looks like into 2022 and thus remain a core tenet of our unwavering tech bull thesis with this another pound the table moment to own tech stocks.”</p><p>Ives concedes that the pandemic led to “a massive pull forward” in demand for cloud, e-commerce, cyber security and other tech companies. But he said it's way too early to throw in the white towel and said investors should double down.</p><p>Apple AAPLis Wedbush's favorite of the FAANG stocks, as he cited Microsoft MSFT, DocuSign DOCU, Matterport MTTR and Pegasystems PEGA as favorite cloud stocks.
