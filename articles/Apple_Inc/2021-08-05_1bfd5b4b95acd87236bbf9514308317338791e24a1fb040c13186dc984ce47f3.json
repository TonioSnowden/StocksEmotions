  "title": "Wonder Land:  Zuckerberg Defeated Biles  ----  By Daniel Henninger",
  "text": "<p>   This shouldn't happen to anyone, but with a gymnastics career for history, Simone Biles will remain a cautionary story for our times -- unless we leave her behind for the next hour's media sensation, again ignoring the signs of caution. </p><p>   Ms. Biles said on Instagram that her problem was \"the twisties,\" a phenomenon in which gymnasts lose the ability to keep track of their bodies at high speed. It happens. Some years ago, four-time All-Star second baseman Chuck Knoblauch became unable to throw a ball accurately to first base. He saved his career by moving to the outfield. Ms. Biles returned to the balance beam this week and won a bronze medal. </p><p>   What still remains is the same two-word problem -- mental health -- cited at the French Open for unable-to-cope tennis star Naomi Osaka (\"it's O.K. to not be O.K.\") or countless anonymous American kids. The coronavirus pandemic will recede eventually. The mental-health pandemic won't. </p><p>   The buildup to her Tokyo appearance gave the impression that Simone Biles's Olympics career was on the cusp of a fairy-tale ending. So let's enter the mess that became her Olympics through the door of a fairy tale. </p><p>   Once upon a time, in a faraway land called Harvard University, a young man named Mark Zuckerberg came upon the idea of using the internet so students in college could connect easily and instantly with friends. It was a wonderful idea, a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that let Mark live in a magical place called Silicon Valley. </p><p>   As all children know, fairy tales that begin in wonder can go wrong. One day the young wizard called Mark turned into the sorcerer's apprentice, creating a world of multiplying Facebook friends who couldn't control the unreal lives they found on Mark's social media platforms. </p><p>   One of the people who got lost was Simone Biles. </p><p>   If this really were a fairy tale like \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" a wise head would restore order. But we live in the real world, and no evidence exists that we are going to awake anytime soon from the dream world called social media. </p><p>   Fame became a mass-media phenomenon about 100 years ago, when everyone became mesmerized by the stars on Hollywood's big screens. People would go to the movies or later watch television and think, innocently enough: I wish I could be that famous. With social media, the siren song of celebrity became reality. </p><p>   Celebrities routinely and willingly sacrifice mental stability for fame. It's irresistible. What we've done with modern social media is democratize neurosis. Today all can obsess about themselves all the time -- what they look like or what others (their social-media \"public\") are saying about them. </p><p>   After a week of controversy about withdrawing from the gymnastic competition, Ms. Biles produced an explanation in more than a dozen posts on Instagram. Instagram is owned by Facebook, which in May floated the idea of an Instagram platform for children under 13. What could go wrong? </p><p>   Sometime in the past decade, stories started appearing in the higher-education trade press about a sharp upturn in students visiting college mental-health centers. It had something to do with \"stress.\" Initially, it was hard to believe the numbers in these stories. But soon the universities were having trouble expanding staff fast enough to meet the demand for mental-health support. It was clear 10 years ago that something new was going off the rails with young people. </p><p>   A popular fix is the idea that parents somehow should solve this massive problem by \"monitoring\" their children's screen time. You mean the parents texting on iPhones as they walk their kids in strollers? </p><p>   No commentary on this subject can end without a trip to the battlefields of the culture wars. </p><p>   One of the most popular TV shows ever was \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,\" starring the real-world Nelson family -- parents and their two sons. It ran from 1952 to 1966. Look at those years again. Were they good years or bad for life in America? </p><p>   For intellectuals on the advancing left, \"Ozzie and Harriet,\" which was known as a \"family situation comedy,\" became shorthand for a U.S. society that was overly idealized, personally repressive and too morally restrictive. The bitter irony is that their solution was to minimize personal restraints. </p><p>   Well, here we are. </p><p>   The modern narrative of nonstop disruption of everything -- today more dominant and uncompromising than ever -- has been false, a mistake that has done damage to millions, notably the young, not because they are weak or vulnerable but because no one should attempt to live inside such hyper-interiorized bubbles with so little structure. (\"Interiorized\" is a dreadful word, and appropriately so.) </p><p>   My own favored fix is also something out of the 1950s time warp: Go to church on Sunday. The secularism-forever lobby laughs at that suggestion. What's to laugh about these days? </p><p>   Forget breaking up Facebook, which would multiply the original nightmare. We either wake up and relearn some lost basics or get used to seeing the derailment of a magnificent career like Simone Biles's become an everyday event. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Write henninger@wsj.com. </p><p></p>",
