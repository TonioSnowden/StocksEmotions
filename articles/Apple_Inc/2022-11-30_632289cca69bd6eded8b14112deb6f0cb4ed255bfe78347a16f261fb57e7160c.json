  "title": "Volkswagen, Honda Halt Production at China Plants Due to Covid-19 Curbs; Concerns of supply-chain disruptions emerge amid outbreak, protests",
  "text": "<p>Toyota Motor Corp. is also adjusting production at some of its factories in China because of Covid-19 disruptions, spokesman Tomoki Yoshida said.</p><p>Honda's automotive plant in Wuhan in central China partially resumed production on Wednesday after closing for two days because many workers were locked down, said spokesman Atsuki Hina. A Honda factory in Chongqing that produces lawn mowers and generator engines has halted production since Nov. 10 due to a Covid-19 outbreak, he said. The car maker is starting to see disruption in its supply chain, though the scale is still limited, he said.</p><p>The production halts are the latest examples of economic costs from Beijing's continued rigid Covid-19 curbs and underscore how supply-chain disruptions are bubbling up yet again in China. Under China's zero-Covid policy and repeated lockdowns, factories are cutting back on outputs while worker and student protests have spread in the country as public resentment grows.</p><p>At the world's largest iPhone factory in central China, run by Foxconn Technology Group, a Covid-19 outbreak that started in October resulted in thousands of workers fleeing and violent clashes between workers and police. Apple Inc. said this month that shipments of its high-end iPhone models would be lower than expected because of the disruptions.</p><p>Earlier this year, the car industry suffered from supply-chain disruptions in China, when automotive hubs such as Shanghai and parts of the northeastern province of Jilin were locked down for months.</p><p>The number of Covid-19 infections reported by China's health authorities has reached almost 40,000 a day recently, with the most serious outbreaks in Guangdong, Beijing and Chongqing.</p><p>In Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, Chinese electric vehicle startup Xpeng Inc. has been operating its plant in a closed-loop setup, a spokeswoman said—which means largely keeping the site shut off from the outside world and allowing workers to only move between their lodgings and the production lines. Xpeng is also experiencing a component shortage that has affected vehicle production, she said.</p><p>Some multinational companies are concerned about economic fallout from the latest protests. Protests could spread and \"that could impact various industries—first and foremost, that could hit the supply chain yet again,\" Kengo Sakurada, the chairman of Japan Association of Corporate Executives, a major Japanese business lobby, said in a news conference this week.</p><p>Companies are also reviewing their sourcing reliance on China.</p><p>Airbus SE, the world's biggest plane maker, is assessing how to dual-source products it buys from Chinese suppliers amid logistical challenges caused by China's zero-Covid policy as well as heightened political tensions between China and the West, said Chief Executive Guillaume Faury.</p><p>China's Covid lockdowns are affecting Airbus's local suppliers further down its supply chain and weighing on the plane maker's ability to deliver aircraft on time, Mr. Faury said on Tuesday at an event hosted by the Aerospace, Security and Defence Industries Association of Europe lobby group.</p><p>Indexes that gauge activity in China's manufacturing, services and construction industries dropped more than expected this month, data released on Wednesday showed.</p><p>—River Davis and Benjamin Katz contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Selina Cheng at selina.cheng@wsj.com</p><p>Volkswagen, Honda Halt Production at China Plants Due to Covid-19 Curbs</p>",
