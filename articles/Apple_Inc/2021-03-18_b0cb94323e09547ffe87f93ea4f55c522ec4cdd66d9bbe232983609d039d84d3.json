The US central bank also reiterated that it would continue to buy bonds at a rate of $120bn per month. </p> <p>But the upgrades to the growth forecasts were significant: whereas in December Fed officials <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74b6530e-9d69-43f0-a5d7-3cb363ed5398\">predicted</a>&#xa0;4.2 per cent growth this year, that estimate was bumped up to 6.5 per cent, which would be the fastest economic expansion since 1984.</p> <p>The unemployment rate is now forecast to fall to 4.5 per cent by the end of the year instead of 5 per cent. Core personal consumption expenditure inflation, the Fed's preferred measure, is expected to rise to 2.2 per cent and above the central bank's 2 per cent target, compared with the smaller rise to 1.8 per cent predicted in December.</p> <p>The 10-year Treasury yield, a key benchmark for borrowing costs across global financial markets, rose as much as 0.096 percentage points to 1.738 per cent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55eb123d-b45e-4c30-a5e8-c026309cb482\">in European trading on Thursday</a>. It has not held above 1.7 per cent since January 2020, before the market ructions triggered by the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent on Wednesday after paring losses.
