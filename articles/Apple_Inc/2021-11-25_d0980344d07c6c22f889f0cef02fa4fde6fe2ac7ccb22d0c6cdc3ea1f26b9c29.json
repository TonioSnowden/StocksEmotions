  "title": "'The Beatles: Get Back' Documentary: How to Watch and What to Know; Director Peter Jackson revises the narrative around the Liverpool band's acrimonious split",
  "text": "<p>When is The Beatles' documentary coming out and how can I watch it?</p><p>The first installment of \"The Beatles: Get Back\" will be released on Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ streaming platform on Nov. 25. The second will drop on Nov. 26, and the final comes on Nov. 27. Fans will need a Disney+ subscription to access the series.</p><p>Who is Peter Jackson, the creator of the film?</p><p>Mr. Jackson is the Oscar-winning director of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, and a lifelong Beatles fan. As a child growing up in New Zealand, he said discovering the band's red and blue albums was a \"life-changing experience,\" according to the film's production notes.</p><p>How did the film come about?</p><p>Apple Corps, the company that manages all of The Beatles' creative and business interests, met with Mr. Jackson in the summer of 2017 to see if he was interested in creating a documentary from the wealth of audio visual materials in their vaults, according to the film's production notes. The company gave him few explicit instructions other than to restore the film and tell the full story.</p><p>Where did the footage in the film come from?</p><p>To piece together the documentary, Mr. Jackson drew from nearly 60 hours of unseen film footage and 150 hours of unheard audio recordings. This included the \"Get Back Sessions\" for the band's studio album \"Let It Be\"—recorded over 22 days in London in January 1969.</p><p>What period of time does the film cover?</p><p>When we meet the Beatles in this documentary, they are 13 years into their run as bandmates. \"They are in the process of going their own ways but coming back together for one last hurrah,\" said Bob Spitz, who wrote \"The Beatles: The Biography.\" That \"hurrah\" is the \"Let It Be\" album, and a concert that they gave for free on the roof of the Apple Corps building, which plays in its entirety in the film.</p><p>Has this period in Beatles history been covered before?</p><p>Yes. The recording sessions were previously the subject of \"Let It Be,\" a 1970 vérité film by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Bolstered by bandmember's own testimony, that film eventually took on a reputation as a bleak portrait of the band's eventual collapse.</p><p>Will there by any controversial moments in the film?</p><p>\"I know their tempers were frazzled and that they had no patience for each other,\" said Mr. Spitz. \"There are some sharp edges and some sharp elbows being thrown,\" but the Beatles' love for one another and their companionship shine through, Mr. Spitz said. A preview reel for the film emphasizes silliness, with the band goofing around the studio and dancing. \"It pulls to that concert on the roof, and that's the Beatles at the top of their form.\"</p><p>Write to Rachel Wolfe at rachel.wolfe@wsj.com</p><p>'The Beatles: Get Back' Documentary: How to Watch and What to Know</p>",
