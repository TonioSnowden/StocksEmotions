A Slice of History</p><p>By Greg Pizzoli</p><p>Supposing . . .</p><p>By Alastair Reid</p><p>Illustrated by JooHee Yoon</p><p>Sometimes the happiest days are the least expected: There's no formal plan, no scheduled activity, no reason to think that the hours will unfurl in any auspicious way. It may be only at the day's end that you realize what a splendid time you've had.</p><p>Author and illustrator Philip Waechter captures this sort of serendipity in \"A Perfect Wonderful Day With Friends\" (Gecko, 28 pages, $18.99), a picture book originally published in German last year as \"Ein Tag mit Freunden.\" The friends here are animals, trimly dressed and walking upright, who have houses in the leafy countryside. Readers ages 4-8 meet them one by one, starting with Raccoon, who on a summery day is suffering from boredom: \"An exciting book or some exercise often helps. If those don't work, or if he feels gloom descending too, it's time to bake an apple cake.\" Alas, as we see in Mr. Waechter's finely wrought illustrations (see below), Raccoon can't find all the ingredients for apple cake in his cluttered kitchen, so he trots over to Fox's house in search of eggs. He arrives to find his friend trying and failing to repair a leaky roof; Fox needs a ladder. Off the pair goes to borrow one from Badger, whom they find sitting in an armchair amid pleasant domestic chaos, \"racking his brains over a crossword puzzle.\" Soon the circle of friends expands to include Bear and Crow, and as the languid hours pass, the five companions drift from strolling to fishing to swimming and eventually back to roof-fixing and cake-baking. It all adds up to a calm, happy, perfect, wonderful day that young readers and their parents will find almost as nice as the real thing.</p><p>Animal friends have a lot less fun, at least temporarily, in \"The Great Cookie Kerfuffle\" (Amicus Ink, 32 pages, $18.99), a lively Aesopian counting book written by Jessica Shaw and illustrated by Pauline Gregory. The pairing here of bright, zany pictures and bouncy text gives 3- to 7-year-olds the chance to go through various types of animals (sheep, pigs, hens, et al.) and play with alliteration (roosters raise a ruckus, cats cause a commotion) while practicing their numbers.</p><p>There's a moral dimension too, as the tranquility of a \"friendly, little\" farm is shattered by an apple of discord -- in this case, a cookie -- that falls from a child's lunch bag. Suddenly the peaceable kingdom is fraught with envy and greed: \"There was a flurry of snouts, wings, and beaks, as every one of the animals fought for the cookie.\" Only with the arrival of a feared common enemy do the farm animals remember to make common cause, putting an end to the great cookie kerfuffle.</p><p>\"In the United States of America, we eat 350 slices of pizza every second,\" readers learn from the neon-bright pages of \"Pizza! A Slice of History\" (Viking, 48 pages, $18.99), a picture book by Greg Pizzoli, who, given his name, might have been born with an appetite for the subject. Light and chatty, with blocky illustrations in four culinary colors (a tiny note identifies them as \"sweet-tomato red, fresh-basil green, greasy-cheese yellow, and charred-crust black\"), the book takes readers ages 3-8 through the origins and attributes of a beloved foodstuff.</p><p>It seems that while the ancient Greeks enjoyed a pizza-like dish of flatbread with olives and honey, and Persian soldiers cooked thin crusts right on their shields, pizza as we know it today was popularized by a Neapolitan cook named Raffaele Esposito. \"The story goes,\" Mr. Pizzoli writes, that in 1889 Italy's Queen Margherita \"asked Esposito to bring her some pizza. This was the first pizza delivery.\" It was also a meeting that would immortalize as \"pizza margherita\" the distinctive pie topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella and torn basil that's popular today.</p><p>In Mr. Pizzoli, partisans of particular styles of pizza will not find an ally: He takes no side and condemns nothing, neither the controversial adding of pineapple (\"yes, even this is pizza\") nor even such unorthodox additions as the bananas, peanuts and curry powder that appear on pizza in Sweden, or the four kinds of fish that people eat on cold pies in Russia.</p><p>There's a game children like to play that involves speculating about odd and impossible things. Poet, translator and New Yorker staff writer Alastair Reid (1926- 2014) channeled the idea in \"Supposing . . .\" (1960), a book for young readers containing 32 \"what-if\" scenarios illustrated by graphic designer Bob Gill. For a vivid and beguiling new edition (Enchanted Lion, 56 pages, $18.95), artist JooHee Yoon has revisited, reordered and re-illustrated Reid's original text. The result is a flowing series of conjectures, some playful and others faintly ominous, amid pictures that all but vibrate with bold hues of papaya, orange, teal and hunter green.</p><p>\"Supposing I read a book about how to change into animals and said a spell and changed myself into a cat and when I climbed on the book to change myself back I found I couldn't read,\" goes one entry, as in the artwork we see a naif-style ginger cat standing on an open book strewn with disordered letters. Another goes: \"Supposing a funny old fortune teller told me I was going on a journey and just to bamboozle her I stayed home for the rest of my life.\" About some of Reid's writing there's a sense of dark mischief that does not so much date the text as show how virtuous and safety-oriented children's books have become in the intervening decades. It's hard to imagine any contemporary author being willing to suggest, let alone validate, such naughtiness as: \"Supposing I telephoned people I didn't know in the middle of the night and practiced my horrible sounds over the phone.\"</p>",
