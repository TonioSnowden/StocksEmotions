  "text": "<p>\n  The Deep Places </p><p>\n  By Ross Douthat </p><p>\n  (Convergent, 200 pages, $26) </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Ross Douthat is a New York Times op-ed columnist who vaulted to his perch in 2009 at the age of only 30 -- which may explain why his columns can sometimes read like seminar submissions. Yet this too-earnest quality is only rarely apparent in \"The Deep Places\" -- Mr. Douthat's sixth and latest book -- a harrowing, and often profound, account of how one man's life can be laid almost to waste by Fate. </p><p>\n  In his \"memoir of illness and discovery,\" Mr. Douthat tells us of his descent into a netherworld of consternation, paranoia and despair after contracting a chronic form of Lyme disease six years ago. Although he experienced physical pain that was often unbearable, he was stonewalled and scoffed at by skeptical doctors who refused to accept the existence of a long-lingering form of Lyme. </p><p>\n  In time, Mr. Douthat was drawn into a semi-secret milieu of chronic Lyme sufferers -- \"wealthy, educated types just a stone's throw from New York\" -- whom the medical establishment treated as no better than cranks who needed antidepressants more than antibiotics. Even more than the bodily pain, it was this dismissal of his condition as merely psychosomatic that gave the insistently rational Mr. Douthat his greatest anguish. </p><p>\n  Here's how the story unfurls. In 2015, Mr. Douthat and his wife decided that they'd had enough of \"punishingly competitive\" Washington and their house on Capitol Hill (which had \"appreciated absurdly\" in the four years since they'd bought it). Urban life had lost its cachet, and they'd come to be mugged by reality -- literally in the case of Mrs. Douthat as she strolled with their baby. Days after she was robbed in their neighborhood park, a speeding car nearly knocked her over as she fumbled with a child's car seat along the street outside their house. </p><p>\n  As it happened, the Douthats' galloping disenchantment with Washington fed perfectly into a long-held dream to live in the countryside. \"I always wanted to move back to New England,\" Mr. Douthat writes. It was where he and his wife had grown up. And so they moved -- in a \"real estate coup\" -- to a 1790s farmhouse in rural Connecticut, with three acres of pastureland, a barn and an apple tree. </p><p>\n  Within days of acquiring the dream house, Mr. Douthat awoke with a stiff neck. He found \"a red swelling\" six inches down from his left ear. \"It's just a boil,\" said a doctor, his insouciant declaration the first of many diagnoses in which it was claimed that there was nothing physically wrong with him. Lyme -- a debilitating bacterial disease acquired from deer-tick bites -- was ruled out because many of his symptoms didn't match a rigid checklist drawn up for the ailment by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This \"diagnostic standardization,\" Mr. Douthat writes, was \"supposed to establish a consistent baseline for national case reporting, not rule out the possibility of atypical cases or constrain doctors from diagnosing them.\" As a result of such inflexibility, he tells us, doctors miss \"anywhere from a third to half of early Lyme cases.\" </p><p>\n  But there was obviously something wrong with Mr. Douthat. He was racked with fierce pain in his shoulders, chest, head, legs, back and digestive system. Some nights he barely slept at all. So \"in the way of mysteriously ill people with internet connections,\" he set out to piece together a diagnosis of his own. His conclusion? He did indeed have Lyme disease and not some stress-related condition, as doctors were suggesting. \"What sort of stress-induced illness would manifest itself,\" he asks, \"at a moment of apparent triumph . . . and literal dream-come-true escape?\" </p><p>\n  As his pain became even more intense, Mr. Douthat was aided by \"maverick\" doctors -- many of them sufferers of chronic Lyme disease themselves -- who equipped him with antibiotics and other medications. He triedusing an antibiotic IV-drip \"to wear the sickness down\" before switching to a Rife machine -- the quack-ish brainchild of an American inventor named Royal Raymond Rife, who died penniless in 1971. Its electromagnetic frequencies promised to weaken the hold of bacteria on a sufferer's body. </p><p>\n  The instructions that came with the machine informed Mr. Douthat that he had a legal right to treat himself medically \"by common law.\" And so he did, in ways that went far beyond electro-vibrations. \"My self-diagnosis kept shifting based on which thread or message board I read,\" he tells us. At one stage he was taking 12 antibiotic pills a day, as well as \"every non-prescription antimicrobial substance that any study, however obscure, suggested might kill Lyme bacteria in a test tube.\" The names of these substances are perversely poetic: cat's claw, stevia, goldenseal, andrographis -- a virtual herbarium of desperation. </p><p>\n  The narrative of Mr. Douthat's bodily hell has no happy ending, and it wouldn't be spoiling the story to tell readers that he has yet to recover. When Covid-19 came to America in early 2020, he contracted that, too. He got a negative result in the early days of erratic Covid tests but decided -- by self-diagnosis again -- that he was in fact infected. His description of his symptoms seems to confirm his belief. </p><p>\n  Remarkably, through all of this, Mr. Douthat remains a \"sick but functional person.\" While Lyme-stricken, he had the fortitude to write two books (preceding this one) and the strength to play his part in bringing another child into the Douthat household. His Catholic faith sustains him: Chronic suffering, he says, \"can make belief in a providential God . . . feel essential to your survival.\" In the end, Mr. Douthat's illness defeats his bucolic dream. He sells the farm in the country and moves with his family to a house in tick-free New Haven, Conn. And when his fourth child -- his third daughter -- is born, \"healthy and fat-cheeked,\" he sees in her life a vindication of everything he has done to save his own. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Varadarajan, a Journal contributor, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and at NYU Law School's Classical Liberal Institute. </p><p></p>",
