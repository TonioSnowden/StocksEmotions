  "text": "<p>There are bad days, like when you get notified that there's been a medical emergency at your children's school. There are very bad days, like when a visit to the hospital with your kids is followed by the discovery that your husband is having an affair with an Instagrammer of middling influence. And then there's Aneesha's day, in which all the above happen but against the backdrop of an alien invasion. </p> <p>Apple TV Plus's new series is yet another screen portrayal of Earth's conquest by an extraterrestrial civilisation who, despite having an entire universe at their disposal, consider our pale-blue dot a premium piece of cosmic real estate.</p> <p>For the first three episodes the invaders keep a relatively low profile. After an opening scene in which an unfortunate Bedouin man is set upon by an otherworldly mirage-like being, the series takes its time introducing the five characters through which we experience this latest adventure with aliens. </p> <p>The show's approach of narrating planetary disaster through the perspectives of people from various countries, and not just the US, is a welcome one. That said, the Japanese-language section is the only one that really leans into the idea of globality, with other parts devoted to individuals in Oklahoma, Long Island, London and a US military camp in Afghanistan, the latter already dating this piece of future fiction. </p> <p>But for all the anglophone homogeneity of the lead roles, <em>Invasion</em>'s central problem, in its first instalments at least, is that the characters often feel grafted on to the story from a confused plurality of genres. New Yorker Aneesha (Golshifteh Farahani) is the disabused wife from a marital drama; sensitive English teenager Caspar is caught in a <em>Lord of the Flies</em> situation with school bullies; soldier Trevante is in a military thriller; and small-town sheriff John Bell Tyson (Sam Neill) is one day from retirement when he notices something strange in a crop field. Just when he thought he was out, they pull him back in. Quite literally. </p> <p>As such, any momentum harnessed in one particular narrative thread — by far the most involving is the one about Mitsuki (Shioli Kutsuna), a distraught mission-control worker in Tokyo whose astronaut lover disappears in space — is quickly dissipated by the switch into another, tonally disparate strand. </p> <p>Still, there is enough vaguely intriguing mystery, patient atmosphere-building and big-budget sheen here to ensure that the show remains entirely watchable despite some loose-change characterisations and plotting. But if the aliens are left on the sidelines for much longer we might start to think we're watching <em>Evasion</em>.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>Available now on Apple TV Plus</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2021 'Invasion — Apple TV's big-budget sci-fi series holds back on the extraterrestrials' FT.com 22 October.
