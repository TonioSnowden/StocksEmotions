  "text": "<p>Skechers said that two company executives escorted Mr. West and his party from the building in Los Angeles after a brief conversation. The company didn't elaborate further on the nature of the conversation.</p><p>\"Skechers is not considering and has no intention of working with West,\" the company said. \"We condemn his recent divisive remarks and do not tolerate antisemitism or any other form of hate speech.\"</p><p>Mr. West didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Adidas AG on Tuesday became the latest partner to cut ties with Mr. West, who goes by Ye, citing the musician and fashion-brand owner's recent string of anti-Semitic comments. Adidas said it \"does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech.\"</p><p>Gap Inc., which ended its multiyear partnership with Mr. West last month, on Tuesday said it was removing Yeezy Gap products from its stores and shut down the website for the collaboration. Foot Locker Inc. said that while it remains an Adidas partner, it instructed its retail staff to pull any existing Yeezy product from its shelves and digital sites.</p><p>Two high-profile athletes -- Aaron Donald of the Los Angeles Rams and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics -- said Tuesday in statements posted on Twitter that they are parting ways with Donda Sports, a sports-marketing agency founded by Mr. West earlier this year.</p><p>Mr. West continues to own Yeezy LLC, the apparel company he incorporated in 2016, and holds his Yeezy trademark and several others within Mascotte Holdings Inc. Without large industry partners, his future fashion prospects are in question. Working with large fashion houses and retail chains provided the entertainer access to creative talent as well as production and distribution channels to reach consumers.</p><p>\"I doubt there is an immediate future for Kanye West in fashion,\" said Luca Solca, global luxury analyst at Bernstein. \"I believe a long period of atonement will be required in West's case, before any brand will be ready to engage with him again.\"</p><p>Neither Mr. West nor his representatives responded to requests for comment.</p><p>The 45-year-old rapper, who released hit albums and produced tracks for Jay-Z and other stars, has for years talked about climbing the fashion-industry ladder. \"I believe that Yeezy is the McDonald's and the Apple of apparel,\" said Mr. West in a 2020 interview with The Wall Street Journal. By that point, Mr. West had already made several forays into fashion.</p><p>Mr. West worked with Nike Inc. on a much sought-after sneaker line. In 2009, he interned at the Italian fashion house Fendi, alongside Virgil Abloh who years later would launch the fashion line Off-White and serve as Louis Vuitton's creative director.</p><p>The same year, he worked with Louis Vuitton on a line of pricey sneakers, some with details such as dangling tassels and neon-pink soles. His Paris runway debut came in 2011 with the brand DW by Kanye West, though the show was critically panned and the brand never made it off the ground.</p><p>Items that the artist designed in collaboration with Adidas made their debut in 2015, and the parties entered a long-term partnership the following year.</p><p>Yeezy products would come to represent roughly 8% of the company's total sales, according to UBS analysts. Adidas's sales totaled 21.23 billion euros in 2021, equivalent to $21.04 billion.</p><p>Mr. West has earned hundreds of millions of dollars through the partnership, which granted him a 15% cut of the sales of Yeezy products, though Adidas retained ownership of the designs, according to people familiar with the deal.</p><p>Before the latest controversies, Mr. West had already largely parted ways with the record industry. His Grammy-nominated album \"Donda,\" released in August 2021, fulfilled his contractual agreement as an artist with his longtime label Def Jam Recordings, according to people familiar with the matter. That made him a free agent in the music industry, after entering the Def Jam system in the early 2000s. The joint-venture agreement between Def Jam and G.O.O.D. Music, the record label that Mr. West launched, has also ended. Def Jam and its parent Universal Music Group NV still distribute the musical catalog from that joint venture.</p><p>\"Def Jam's relationship with Ye as a recording artist, Def Jam's partnership with the G.O.O.D. Music label venture and Ye's merchandise agreement with Bravado all ended in 2021,\" Universal Music Group said.</p><p>The talent agency CAA has dropped Mr. West as a client, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Earlier this month, Mr. West sent a tweet that read in part that he planned to go \"death con [sic] 3 on Jewish people.\" In the weeks since, the mogul espoused similar anti-Semitic statements on the \"Drink Champs\" podcast and in televised interviews.</p><p>These comments capped off a controversy-stoking chapter in Mr. West's public life. On Oct. 3, he wore a \"White Lives Matter\" T-shirt at his Yzy fashion show in Paris. He has also used social media to rail against Adidas, Gap and other fashion-world figures including Supreme creative director Tremaine Emory and Vogue editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson.</p><p>Other companies are dissociating from Mr. West. The RealReal, a luxury consignment website, said on Tuesday it was no longer accepting items associated with Mr. West or the Yeezy brand.</p><p>Balenciaga, which was until recently so closely aligned with the musician that he opened its show at Paris Fashion Week this month, has also cut ties.</p><p>---</p><p>Neil Shah and Nick Kostov contributed to this article.</p>",
