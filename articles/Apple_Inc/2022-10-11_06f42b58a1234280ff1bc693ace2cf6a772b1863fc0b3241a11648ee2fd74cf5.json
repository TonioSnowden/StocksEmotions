  "text": "<p>A lawyer for Mr. Syed didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Syed was convicted in 2000 for the murder of Ms. Lee, an 18-year-old high-school student and his ex-girlfriend. Mr. Syed, who was 17 years old at the time of her death, was charged as an adult. He had been serving a life sentence at the Patuxent Institution, a state prison in Jessup, Md., according to state records.</p><p>A Baltimore Circuit judge vacated Mr. Syed's murder conviction in September after prosecutors said new evidence suggested there were two suspects who may have been involved in Ms. Lee's death, including one who had told someone he would make her disappear. The suspects weren't properly ruled out during the first investigation, prosecutors said.</p><p>Judge Melissa Phinn ordered Mr. Syed to be released under home detention and said the state would have 30 days to set a new trial date, should they choose to.</p><p>Prosecutors said at the time they weren't making the case that he was innocent but said he should have a new trial.</p><p>After Mr. Syed's conviction was vacated, \"Serial\" rose to the top of Apple Inc.'s list of podcasts in the U.S. The podcast released a new episode titled \"Adnan Is Out,\" eight years after the show made its debut.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>Adnan Syed Murder Charges Dropped by Baltimore Prosecutors</p>",
