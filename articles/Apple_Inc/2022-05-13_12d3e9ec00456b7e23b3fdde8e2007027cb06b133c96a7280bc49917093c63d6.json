  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start:</strong> Warner Music and KKR-backed BMG are competing to buy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac4a857a-c45f-4916-95ac-de2f1e03093d\">Pink Floyd's entire back catalogue</a> for $500mn as the battle to acquire music rights heats up.</p> <h2>SoftBank sinks to record loss</h2> <p>Keen <strong>SoftBank </strong>followers will know that things at the Japanese conglomerate haven't been going well for a while. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/507e3c7f-c7da-43a5-857f-64a1fc9f1591\">record $27bn loss</a> revealed by its Vision Fund solidified that this week. </p> <p>Billionaire founder <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong> acknowledged investor worries about his missed bets and SoftBank's cash position, highlighting the company's renewed focus on financial prudence. (That prudence has extended to its presentations too, with no unicorns or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc8e7021-e808-4f9c-aa55-a8e77e05a9ff\">golden eggs</a> in sight this time.)</p> <p>Son showed in large Chinese characters the word mamori, or “defence”, highlighting a new, more cautious phase for the conglomerate. </p> <p>“When the world is in disorder, SoftBank should play defence,” he said.</p> <p>The Vision Fund's losses plunged SoftBank as a whole into its biggest ever quarterly net loss of $16bn. Underscoring the severity of shareholders' concerns, shares in the group tumbled to their lowest level this year, extending the fall to 30 per cent.</p> <p>“We are slowing down the pace of investments and increasing our cash position because the world is in turmoil,” said Son repeatedly. “If it rains, you open your umbrella.”</p> <p>The record losses follow a tumultuous time at the conglomerate. </p> <p>Its Nasdaq whale bets proved disastrous, racking up $6-7bn worth of losses. Last month the <strong>SB Northstar</strong> fund behind the huge tech bets <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/197c32a9-cfed-418c-9351-ec8eefe54328\">liquidated</a> all of its holdings and shut its doors. <strong>Akshay Naheta</strong>, head of the unit and the brain behind SoftBank's controversial <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8eec9d0-0c85-467d-8cb1-467ad87adced\">bet on <strong>Wirecard</strong></a>, left the conglomerate the same day. His departure followed that of <strong>Marcelo Claure</strong>, Son's right-hand man, whose demand for $1bn in compensation led to an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bb689ee-71a5-4952-99b7-a60ee7216303\">acrimonious departure</a>. </p> <p>SoftBank's holdings have been pummelled by rising interest rates and Beijing's crackdown on the tech sector. Its biggest losers for the past quarter included Chinese ride-hailing giant <strong>Didi Chuxing</strong>, whose shares lost about half their value, and South Korean ecommerce platform <strong>Coupang</strong>, which fell about 40 per cent. </p> <p>Other notable laggards included Singaporean ride-hailing company <strong>Grab</strong>, US food delivery firm <strong>DoorDash </strong>and Indian payments group <strong>Paytm</strong>, which together lost close to $5bn over the quarter, according to <strong>Redex Research</strong> analyst <strong>Kirk Boodry</strong>'s estimates. </p> <p>Boodry said he was surprised the SoftBank leader was only talking about slowing investments and doing more due diligence now: “Maybe, like, you should always be doing that?”&#xa0;</p> <p>Son also said he would be slowing investments in China, where the group has heavy exposure through a 25 per cent stake in <strong>Alibaba</strong>, the ecommerce group owned by <strong>Jack Ma </strong>that has come under increasing pressure from regulators. </p> <p>With a bad quarter firmly in the rear-view mirror, the focus shifts to how SoftBank can raise cash. </p> <p>Hopes are pinned on the IPO of UK chip designer <strong>Arm, </strong>which is locked in a battle to regain control of its renegade Chinese unit from head <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48baeb67-2d3c-41c3-8645-e89ac69a985a\"><strong>Allen Wu</strong></a>.</p> <p>Questions linger over whether Arm's listing will fetch the lofty valuation Son expected from the now-collapsed deal with <strong>Nvidia</strong>.</p> <p>That leaves on the table spinning off the listed stakes — including in profitable company <strong>SoftBank Telecom</strong>, or the group's Alibaba holding. But divestments would mean Son would lose the chance to borrow against those shares to raise cash for investing in other start-ups. </p> <p>As ever with SoftBank, anything is possible.</p> <h2>VCs click on NFTs&#xa0;</h2> <p>It's no secret that venture capitalists have become a bit crypto-crazed during the recent bull run.</p> <p>Firms including <strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong> and <strong>Paradigm </strong>have raised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bf0ed56-1de5-4750-877f-c9cff753935c\">billion-dollar funds</a> just to invest in cryptocurrency start-ups and tokens. Generalist funds like <strong>Sequoia Capital</strong> and <strong>Lightspeed Venture Partners</strong> have also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a591cd7b-ea3b-4fd4-bab7-41080b2089ea\">jumped in</a>.</p> <p>Now, venture capitalists have another toy to play with: non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, the bits of computer code that represent ownership of digital items such as virtual land and . . . <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acc635d6-bb05-4af6-b4da-b8462c06466d\">cartoon apes</a>? </p> <p>“When we think about buying NFTs, it's in line with our investment strategy, which is thinking about investing in things that have the potential to return many, many multiples of the fund,” <strong>Ophelia Brown</strong>, managing partner of the venture fund <strong>Blossom Capital</strong>, told DD's Miles Kruppa. </p> <p>Blossom is hardly alone. Both Andreessen and Paradigm have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de268ae5-8ee2-472e-a49b-243e63e7ef5c\">invested directly in NFTs</a>, and several fund managers are raising tens of millions of dollars for NFT strategies. &#xa0;</p> <p>Early buyers of collections like <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club</strong> and <strong>CryptoPunks </strong>have made eye-watering returns, so it feels inevitable that venture capitalists would want a slice of the action. </p> <p>The catch is they might have trouble finding enough attractive investments any time soon. NFTs are a small part of the broader cryptocurrency space, and the entire market is going through its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5887ef43-d43a-4608-a1ac-aacc99f076b9\">worst week of trading</a> in years. </p> <p>DD understands that endowments and other institutional investors remain skittish about fund managers buying NFTs and might not look too fondly on sizeable investments. </p> <p>Sequoia, for instance, has the option to invest directly in NFTs but hasn't pulled the trigger on any purchases yet, one person briefed on the fund's policies told DD. It might be a while before they decide to take a punt. </p> <p>Until then, <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=575981ede74eb90300a44d8e\">sign up</a> to our FintechFT newsletter for more on this space.</p> <h2>A casino heist, Latvian mogul and London's lure&#xa0;</h2> <p>On a rainy morning in June 2017, a lone man clad in a balaclava and blue boiler suit strode through the brass-plated entrance and up the marble and gold-fronted staircase of the <strong>Park Lane Club</strong> in London. Moments later, he burst on to the casino floor, sending croupiers and waiters fleeing. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3e2f875-5080-408b-ba56-0a7428bab2b1#\">This was a robbery</a>, and he was armed.</p> <p>He leapt over the cashier's desk and began loading his bag full with bills from the cash drawer. Almost as quickly as he entered, he left, slipping off his balaclava and boiler suit and disappearing into a Tube station underground. The heist was the first to rock a London casino in decades. &#xa0;</p> <p>What follows is a tale of hubris and humiliation in the heart of exclusive Mayfair, among the discreet world of high-stakes gambling. Latvian businessman <strong>Vasilijs Melniks</strong> dreamt of establishing himself in London by owning a casino and enmeshing himself with British high society. What he didn't foresee was run-ins with Russian organised crime, an attempted kidnapping, extortion and the difficulty of satisfying the demands of high rollers. &#xa0;</p> <p>Chronicled by Miles Johnson for FT Magazine, the tale illuminates the underbelly of London's member-only gaming rooms and its magnetism for new, foreign money, before China's anti-corruption purges and Russian sanctions.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Twitter</strong>'s consumer general manager, <strong>Kayvon Beykpour</strong>, has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3a01dd5-0d85-4bae-a472-083d52e5f712\">let go</a> by chief executive <strong>Parag Agrawal</strong>.
