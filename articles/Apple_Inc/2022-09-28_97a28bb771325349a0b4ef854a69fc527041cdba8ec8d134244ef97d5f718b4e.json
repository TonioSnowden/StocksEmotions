The messages were deleted from the page, and Fast Company took its site entirely offline as a precaution, where, as of 11 p.m. Eastern, users saw only a \"404 Not Found\" error message.</p><p>\"Fast Company's Apple News account was hacked on Tuesday evening,\" the company said in a tweet. \"Two obscene and racist push notifications were sent about a minute apart. The messages are vile and not in line with the content and ethos of Fast Company. We are investigating the situation and have suspended the feed &amp; shutdown http://FastCompany.com until we are certain the situation has been resolved.\"</p><p>When asked for comment Tuesday night, Apple referred to an an Apple News tweet that said it had disabled Fast Company's channel.</p><p>It was unclear whether the Apple News platform was also compromised, or if the hack was entirely through Fast Company's web publishing tools.</p><p>Hackers hijack Fast Company, send obscene push alert through Apple News</p>",
