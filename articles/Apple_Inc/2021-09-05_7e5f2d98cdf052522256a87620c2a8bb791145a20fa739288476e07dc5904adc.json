  "text": "<p>Bosses across the City of London are hoping that most staff will this month start to spend at least some of the time at their offices, combining inducements such as social events and free food alongside policies that will insist on a minimum number of days' attendance.</p> <p>A poll by the Chartered Management Institute of more than 1,000 managers showed that more than four-fifths who reported staff were still homeworking in July said that “at least” some would be asked to return to the workplace in September.</p> <p>Ann Francke, head of the CMI, said that while “Big Bang-type returns are largely ruled out . . . the office is still viewed as an essential aspect of working life and a place to connect with colleagues, learn from each other, collaborate and socialise”.</p> <p>Executives have been heartened by rising staff vaccination rates despite an increase in Covid-19 infection rates. This is in contrast to countries such as the US where many businesses, including Google and Apple, have delayed return-to-the-office plans until the new year.</p> <p>Many UK companies have created hybrid working models that are being rolled out this month. Most want staff in the office between two and four days a week.</p> <p>Abrdn, the asset manager, said its office would be turned to “blended working” from Monday.</p> <p>“We envisage this to be around two days a week [in the office] for most colleagues from early September, with a view to increasing to three days a week in 2022,” the company said.</p> <p>Janus Henderson, another asset manager, has given similar guidance but said some staff were already coming in more than this.</p> <p>Law firm Slaughter and May has told London staff they must be in the office three or four days a week from Monday, depending on seniority. </p> <p>Clifford Chance, a rival, will adopt an “agile” 50/50 split between home and office working from Monday, with insurer Legal and General pursuing a similar approach. </p> <p>Catherine McGuinness, policy chair of the City of London Corporation, which governs the Square Mile, said the City's streets and public transport — as well as its bars and restaurants — were much busier, suggesting the return-to-office was gathering pace.</p> <p>The corporation's own offices at Guildhall — operating under Covid safety rules — were now so busy that some staff found themselves without desks, she added.</p> <p>According to Transport for London, travel on the Underground has been growing over the past month despite the normal August slowdown. It said the 8am to 9am rush hour last week was more than 10 per cent higher than the previous week, although it was still about 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. </p> <p>Laura Hinton, chief people officer at advisory firm PwC, said 10 to 15 per cent of the group's employees were coming to the office on any given day, with about a third of people at least once a week. “I would imagine that by the end of September the vast majority of our people will be spending at least a couple of days a week in the office,” she said.&#xa0;</p> <p>The “large majority” of Bank of America staff will return in September and October, according to a person familiar with the plans. Employees are being given 30 days' notice of being invited back into the office to make “the necessary arrangements in their personal lives”.</p> <p>Citigroup expects most London workers to now start coming to its Canary Wharf offices for a minimum of three days a week, while French bank Société Générale will ask staff to come to the office on average two to three days a week. </p> <p>Other financial services companies such as Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas, Lloyds, Aviva, Santander and NatWest all expect staff numbers in the office to increase this autumn as they roll out hybrid work plans.</p> <p>The intentions are not always pure: one financial services chair said he worried that staff were not working as hard at home as in the office. The end of the year would lead to a swift escalation in efforts to get workers back as close to full time as possible, he said.</p> <p>The boss of one Big Four accounting firm admitted he was fighting his instinct to come to the office every day to avoid making staff feel they should be in full time despite its hybrid working policy.</p> <p>The government dropped the work-from-home instruction in the summer but has given advice over how companies should bring back workers in Covid-safe workplaces. </p> <p>Officials are facing their own choices over the future of working in Whitehall, although the government said it was also “gradually increasing the numbers of staff in the workplace, while ensuring we retain the flexibility of home-based working where appropriate”.</p> <p>Each department is drawing up its own approach to hybrid working. “There won't be a single order saying, for example, people must work three days in the office against two days from home,” said one official.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Bank of England has postponed plans to introduce a weekly “team day” this month when staff would return to Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>Companies from BT and BofA to Axa and Allianz are encouraging, but not requiring, vaccine take-up for UK staff. One banker said that “our lawyers and HR have concluded that you can't really demand to see vaccination status, and things are slightly different culturally” than in the US, where vaccinations are more commonly mandatory.</p> <p>Owing to the UK's high vaccination rate, HSBC has decided not to require vaccinations or testing before employees return to its British offices. However, for large events, proof of fully vaccinated status and lateral flow testing are mandatory, the bank said.</p> <p>Companies are still implementing Covid safety rules in the office given continued concerns among staff about infection, but workplaces are relaxing some requirements this month. </p> <p>Advisory firm Deloitte will end social distancing in most of its UK offices this week while rivals PwC and KPMG are advising staff to wear masks in enclosed areas such as lifts or toilets but not when they are moving around the corridors.</p> <p>KPMG is providing designated desks for people who are not comfortable with the removal of social distancing. PwC is considering piloting a similar plan.</p> <p>“It's kind of a balance,” said Hinton. “If you were encouraging people to come back to collaborate [and] to socialise with their colleagues, sitting in a different part of the building where they can stay distanced doesn't really achieve that.”</p> <p><em>Reporting by Daniel Thomas, Stephen Morris, Ian Smith, Attracta Mooney, Michael O'Dwyer, Jim Pickard and Owen Walker</em></p><p>Source: FT reporters 2021 'UK employers plot return of office workers' FT.com 5 September.
