  "title": "U.S. News: Biden Pushes Goal To Halve Emissions --- President targets 2030 as he looks to assert U.S. leadership in fight against climate change",
  "text": "<p>John Kerry, the Biden administration's special climate envoy, and Gina McCarthy, the White House's national climate adviser, briefed a group of Senate Democrats Wednesday afternoon on the target, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The White House declined to comment on the briefing.</p><p>Administration officials said 40 world leaders would participate in this week's climate summit. Mr. Biden invited a group that comprises European allies and some autocrats from U.S. rivals that are among the world's biggest emitters and fossil-fuel producers, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House has noted that invitees include 17 countries responsible for about 80% of all global emissions, an effort to supercharge ambitions going into negotiations scheduled for November to raise targets for reducing emissions.</p><p>Some developing countries are expected to use the summit to urge wealthier nations to help finance efforts to reduce emissions and to adapt to the effects of a warming planet. Brazil has asked the Biden administration for $1 billion in exchange for it reducing deforestation by 40%. India, meantime, has also stressed to the U.S. the importance of industrialized countries making good on pledges to mobilize as much as $100 billion a year in support of similar efforts.</p><p>Mr. Biden is facing pressure to convince other nations and his Republican opponents at home that he can get China to commit to more ambitious efforts to slash emissions.</p><p>\"Unless China stops its uninhibited growth of emissions, anything we do will be offset fourfold by the Chinese,\" said Rep. Garret Graves (R., La.), the top Republican on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.</p><p>The Biden administration seeks to show the U.S. is committed to lowering emissions after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. The new target will likely be seen by other nations and environmental groups as ambitious, said advocates, some of whom had briefed the White House in recent weeks on data arguing that the 50% target is achievable.</p><p>\"That's the kind of number that they're going to need to be credible in the international community,\" said Heather Zichal, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, a trade group, who was a top climate adviser to President Barack Obama.</p><p>A White House official declined to comment on the target, adding that it had not been completed.</p><p>Mr. Biden's emissions target is certain to face criticism from GOP lawmakers and some in the business community who worry that the administration's climate policies could harm the economy. Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas) criticized the Paris agreement this week, arguing it \"disproportionately penalizes American workers.\"</p><p>Other businesses will loudly support Mr. Biden's move. More than 300 of them -- including Apple Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and Walmart Inc. -- signed an open letter last week to Mr. Biden saying a 50% cut is the least he should adopt.</p><p>Mr. Kerry met with Chinese officials in Shanghai last week in a bid to restart bilateral climate discussions between the two nations. Following the meeting, the U.S. and China said in a joint statement that they would work together to set more ambitious goals to tackle climate change. Mr. Kerry told reporters that the two sides discussed the possibility of China enhancing the commitments. Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in September that China would reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality -- net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions -- by 2060.</p><p>Mr. Kerry said in an interview last week that China's pledge to achieve net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions by 2060 isn't fast enough, and he prodded the country to go further.</p>",
