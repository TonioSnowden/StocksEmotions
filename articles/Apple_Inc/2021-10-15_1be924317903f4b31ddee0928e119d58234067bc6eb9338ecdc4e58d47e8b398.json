  "text": "<p>The name came with uncomfortable rhymes that felt like taunts. The assumption was I was a showoff or came from privilege. None of that was true. I became an actor by accident.</p><p>My parents were in show business, but they started out with very little. They met at the University of Oklahoma. They both dreamed of becoming actors.</p><p>Soon after moving to New York, my mother, Jean, suggested that Dad enlist in the Air Force.</p><p>Our father, Rance, was assigned to Special Services and produced shows. He applied for off-base housing, which allowed my mother to be with him.</p><p>Clint: My parents were an immigrant love story -- leaving Oklahoma for someplace new, not knowing the \"language\" or culture of New York. Yet they found their way and made friends.</p><p>Ron: When I was 3 1/2, my father stopped by the office of a friend who was a casting director. Reception was filled with children. They were casting \"The Journey,\" a movie. Dad had an idea.</p><p>He told the receptionist to say that he had stopped by and that his son was a fine actor. His friend called the next day, and I went in and performed a monologue from \"Mister Roberts.\"</p><p>I did well and they wanted a screen test. My father and my mother prepped me.</p><p>Dad created an imitation boom mic by tying a red plastic sandbox pail to a broom handle. A friend of his moved it around the room. Another friend read the other part, and my mother shined a flashlight in my face and used a cereal box as the camera. It worked. I was cast for the role.</p><p>Clint: Dad was all about preparation. He taught us to know where your character has been, what he's trying to do in this moment and where he thinks he's going to go.</p><p>Ron: By the summer of '58, my parents and I moved to California at the urging of Dad's agent. There were opportunities for Dad in Westerns. We drove cross-country.</p><p>Dad took parts in Westerns such as \"Bat Masterson\" and \"Death Valley Days.\" Since I had the perfect, wholesome look for the Eisenhower era, I wound up in parts on kid sitcoms like \"Dobie Gillis\" and \"Dennis the Menace.\"</p><p>Clint: Ron and I both knew early on that acting wasn't playtime. We saw our father had dry spells and that our parents worked hard.</p><p>Ron: Dad thought Clint and I had talent, but we viewed what we had as a skill. My first big break was appearing on CBS's \"Playhouse 90,\" as a kid who drowns. TV producer Sheldon Leonard watched it and wanted me for his new series. But I was already committed to a new show called \"Mr. O'Malley.\"</p><p>When \"Mr. O'Malley\" wasn't picked up, Sheldon had dibs and hired me for \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" I was only in kindergarten and couldn't read, so my father read the scripts to me.</p><p>I memorized the lines by visualizing. Dad taught me to start by understanding what a scene was about. Once I had that pictured in my head, the lines were easier to remember.</p><p>Clint: As a child actor, I had the huge advantage of watching Ron. I was on \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" too, for a series of episodes. Then came \"The Fugitive\" in 1964 and \"Gentle Ben\" from 1967 to 1969. Roles kept coming.</p><p>Ron: Shooting \"Andy Griffith\" wasn't a breeze. I was thrust into the world of adults. What I remember most was the constant smell of sweat from nerves and the stench of cigarettes on the set.</p><p>In 1963, we moved from Hollywood back to Burbank, where Mom and Dad became homeowners for the first time. It was just half a block from our old apartment. It had three bedrooms, one bathroom and, best of all, a pool.</p><p>My first taste of glamour was an awakening. Near the end of the first season of \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" about 20 child and teen actors posed for a photo shoot in a swimming pool. It was daunting to have kid fans asking for my autograph. I was in first grade and doing my best to sign my name. A fan grew impatient, yanked the paper out of my hand and ran off to Jerry Mathers, who had the lead role on \"Leave It to Beaver.\"</p><p>Clint: My relationship with Dad became acute when I had to get emotional in a scene. He had a way of putting his arm around my shoulder, tucking me in close and whispering quietly about the scene. Dad just calmly told me what to do and how to become emotional enough to cry. We'd do this by recalling the passing of a pet. Today, if I just bring up that memory, I can get emotional on set.</p><p>Ron: When our mom died in 2000, Dad was devastated. He died in 2017. After he passed, Clint and I went to their house to pull old photos for a tribute.</p><p>Clint: I still remember appearing with Dad in his last film, \"Apple Seed.\" He had the lead role as a charismatic rogue. I was his unimpressed son. We rehearsed together. The lines were so emotional I tried to hide my tears. When I looked up, Dad was crying too.</p><p>---</p><p>ALL IN THE FAMILY</p><p>RON</p><p>The name Opie still an issue? Not at all. I regard it as a nickname that many fans have a lot of affection for. So anyone on the street, if you see me, feel free.</p><p>Bonus growing up an actor? Today, I'm more comfortable on a set than anywhere else.</p><p>Most surprising thing about your dad? He taught Lee Van Cleef to ride a horse. My father was a real cowboy, Lee was from New Jersey.</p><p>CLINT</p><p>Strongest memory of your father? During the 1971 earthquake, he ran stark naked up the stairs to our bedroom to rescue us.</p><p>Were you and Ron competitive? No. I looked up to him. But we do our fair share of teasing.</p><p>How so? He'll ask me where my bear is, needling me about \"Gentle Ben.\" I'll reply by calling him Opie Cunningham. Keeps us even.</p>",
