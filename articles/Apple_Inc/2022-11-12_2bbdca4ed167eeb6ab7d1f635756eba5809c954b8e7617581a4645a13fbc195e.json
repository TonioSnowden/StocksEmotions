These recipes -- innovative approaches to the feast's centerpiece -- give cooks something to celebrate.  ----  By Amy Thielen",
  "text": "<p>\n  I come from a family of butchers. My people have been pulling tendons, trimming fat and finding our way around the joint for generations. To cook meat well, you have to care about it, form a relationship with it. A good month before Thanksgiving, I like to take a hot cup of tea to a soft chair along with a half-dozen of my favorite cookbooks to start looking for turkey inspiration. I close the books feeling the full weight of the 12- to 14-pound traditional grande dame I will probably, inevitably, make. Just as I made last year and my family made for Thanksgivings 1972-present. I tell myself that a big, brown turkey is what everyone wants -- but is it just what they expect? </p><p>\n  We call it \"the heavy weight of tradition\" for a reason. A common counter-strategy tells us to channel our creativity into the sides, and every year I try out a new fleet of recipes with bold flavors and trendy garnishing bling to surround the magisterial turkey. But once I began to see the side dishes as loud-talking relatives, all of them trying to outdo one another to get the attention of the dignified matriarch, there was no unseeing it. I would have to start getting more creative with the bird itself. </p><p>\n  We've heard it so long we could chant it: It's not about the food, it's about the people around the table. That may be true in normal times, but what is normal anymore? During the pandemic lockdown, days and months stretched out endlessly but, unjustly, the time between meals seemed to narrow and the dirty dishes seemed to multiply exponentially. Following all of that, for the cook, a full day dedicated to selfless service of gravy and generosity may not have the same appeal it once did. At least we learned just how adaptable our traditions can be. I say the one responsible for getting the turkey in the oven, before anyone else arrives to pick up a helping wooden spoon, should cook whatever gives them the greatest pleasure. Maybe this year, this meal of meals can be about the cooking. </p><p>\n  Until recently I was perfectly fine with the traditional Martyr's Thanksgiving. Now, I've realized I'm a better, happier cook when I'm cooking for myself, and hunt for recipes that contain some personal challenge. Still, there's no such thing as an avant-garde Thanksgiving; mousselines and microgreens are taking it too far. So I've come up with three takes on turkey that actually excite me but still satisfy the collective craving for a ritual roast beast. </p><p>\n  The grilled turkey with tare and scallions sanely calls for a small (8- to 10-pound) bird. It marinates in a salty-sweet Japanese-style tare sauce: soy sauce, mirin rice wine, ginger, maple syrup and a browned turkey neck for body and umami depth. After marinating the bird in the tare, you reduce what's left to make a delicious sauce to pass at the table. Toward the end of grilling, add a few handfuls of damp apple or pecan wood chips to the coals to imbue the turkey with the flavor of fruity smoke. The scallions grill to a nice crisp alongside the bird. Carved and plattered, with no garnish but the scallions, this turkey is strikingly minimalist. </p><p>\n  Then again, you don't have to serve a whole turkey to get the feast effect. Bone-out turkey thighs stuffed with a buttery leek-and-fresh-chestnut stuffing feel pretty regal. Pressed into a tight football shape and huddled together in a pan, roasted and basted with butter, the thighs acquire an incredible crispy skin. </p><p>\n  I would also argue that a whole stuffed and roasted cabbage -- what the French call a chou farci -- satisfies the impressive-looking-centerpiece requirement and the studio art credit at the same time. Start with a big, handsome head of Savoy cabbage. Blanch and peel the leaves, stuff them with a ground-turkey-and-pork stuffing that's more like a pate, rich with Cognac and pistachios, then layer and shape them back into an orb. Secure it with string, rub with butter and roast until darkly browned. At the table, carve the cabbage into wedges and serve with a light Champagne-spiked cream sauce. Nothing about the assembly is too difficult, but the process is as restful and fulfilling as shaping a pot on a pottery wheel. On this of all days, the cook deserves nothing less. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Grilled Turkey With Tare and Scallions </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Active Time: 1 1/2 hours </p><p>\n  Total Time: 1 day (includes marinating) </p><p>\n  Serves: 8 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For the tare: </p><p>\n  1 tablespoon canola oil </p><p>\n  1 turkey neck, or 2 leg bones and/or wing tips </p><p>\n  Fine sea salt </p><p>\n  1 1/4 cup shoyu or light soy sauce </p><p>\n  1 1/4 cup mirin </p><p>\n  2/3 cup sake </p><p>\n  2/3 cup water </p><p>\n  1 (1-inch) chunk peeled ginger, lightly smashed </p><p>\n  3 tablespoons maple syrup </p><p>\n  3 tablespoons brown sugar </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For the turkey: </p><p>\n  1 small (8-9 pound) turkey </p><p>\n  Oven bag or 2-gallon sealable bag, for marinating </p><p>\n  Fine sea salt </p><p>\n  Canola oil </p><p>\n  4 bunches scallions, rinsed and trimmed </p><p>\n  Freshly ground black pepper </p><p>\n  Kitchen string </p><p>\n  1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and smashed </p><p>\n  1 large lime, halved </p><p>\n  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted </p><p>\n  1 cup apple or pecan wood chips for smoking, tossed with water to dampen </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1.

Add shoyu, mirin, sake, water, ginger, maple syrup and brown sugar. Simmer to reduce by one-quarter, about 10 minutes. Discard turkey neck. Let cool. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  3. Rinse turkey in a large bowl of water set in sink, removing any innards, and pat dry. Place turkey in oven bag and pour in cooled tare, rubbing sauce inside cavity and around joints. Refrigerate, flipping and turning bag once or twice, at least 12-24 hours and up to 3 days. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  4. 3 hours before serving, prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or meat smoker. When fire has died down and coals have begun to whiten at edges, adjust temperature to hold at 350 degrees. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  5. Lift turkey from bag and set aside. Pour tare into a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and reduce to a dipping-sauce consistency, 5-10 minutes. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  6. Rub a roasting pan that fits on grill with oil. Toss scallions with a little oil, salt and pepper. Lay 1 bunch in pan, and set turkey on top. Tuck wings under turkey, then cross legs and tie with kitchen string. Cut 1 bunch of scallions in half, and add to cavity with smashed ginger. Cover hole with 1 lime half, and tuck the other half under neck skin. Rub turkey with oil, and sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  7. Grill turkey at 350 degrees, basting at least twice with melted butter and tare, until evenly golden brown, about 1 hour. Lay remaining scallions alongside turkey, and reduce temperature to 325 degrees. Continue cooking until an internal thermometer stuck into thickest part of turkey thigh reads 165 degrees, 45-60 minutes more. In the last half hour, drop damp wood chips onto coals to smoke. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  8. Let turkey rest on a cutting board 20 minutes. Warm a platter in oven. Transfer scallions to warm platter, stacked on one side. Carve turkey and arrange on platter with scallions. Pour remaining tare into a gravy boat or cruet to pass. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Crispy-Skinned Turkey Thighs With Chestnut-Leek Stuffing </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Total Time: 3 1/2 hours (includes marinating) </p><p>\n  Serves: 6 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For the turkey and marinade: </p><p>\n  6 skin-on turkey thighs </p><p>\n  1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt </p><p>\n  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </p><p>\n  4 cloves garlic, minced </p><p>\n  2 teaspoons minced rosemary </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For the chestnut-leek stuffing: </p><p>\n  20 fresh chestnuts, or 5 ounces vacuum-packed </p><p>\n  1 large leek </p><p>\n  8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more softened butter for dotting on top </p><p>\n  3/4 cup finely diced celery </p><p>\n  3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt </p><p>\n  3 cloves garlic, minced </p><p>\n  2 1/2 cups coarse fresh bread crumbs </p><p>\n  1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley </p><p>\n  1 teaspoon minced rosemary </p><p>\n  2 eggs </p><p>\n  1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan </p><p>\n  1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg </p><p>\n  3-4 tablespoons turkey or chicken stock </p><p>\n  Canola or extra-virgin olive oil </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For the Sherry jus: </p><p>\n  2 tablespoons unsalted butter </p><p>\n  2 shallots, roughly chopped </p><p>\n  Fine sea salt </p><p>\n  3 tablespoons Sherry </p><p>\n  2 cloves garlic, smashed </p><p>\n  2 cups turkey or chicken stock </p><p>\n  1/2 sprig rosemary or 1 bay leaf </p><p>\n  1 tablespoon all-purpose flour </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  1. Rinse turkey thighs and pat dry. If they're bone-in, set them skin-side down on a cutting board. Use  a sharp knife to slice along either side of thigh bone to free one joint and then the other, and remove the bone. Trim off any cartilage. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  2. Transfer thighs to a large bowl. Add salt, black pepper, 4 cloves minced garlic and minced rosemary. Toss with your hands. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or as long as overnight. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  3. Make the stuffing: If using fresh chestnuts, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Use a paring knife to score round side of each chestnut with a shallow \"x\" and transfer to a baking sheet. Roast until shells begin to roll back and center of chestnut feels tender, 20-30 minutes. Holding warm chestnuts in a towel, use a paring knife to peel off shells and skins. Roughly chop chestnut meat. (Chestnuts can be prepped 4 days in advance and refrigerated in a sealed plastic bag.) </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  4. If oven is not already on, preheat to 375 degrees. Trim stem end of leek. Cut off dark green tops where they begin to branch, and discard. Remove wilted outer leaves from pale green and white parts of leek. Halve leek lengthwise and rinse thoroughly under running water. Slice each half into long strips, then crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat 8 tablespoons butter in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Add leeks and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add diced celery and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic, cook 1 minute more, and remove from heat. </p><pre> </pre><p></p>",
