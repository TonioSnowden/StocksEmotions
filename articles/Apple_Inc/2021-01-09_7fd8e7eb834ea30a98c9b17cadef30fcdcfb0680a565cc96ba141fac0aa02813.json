  "text": "<p>\"In winter, you want to get the biggest possible tires that can fit your frame,\" said Eric Jones, a bike mechanic at Boulder Bicycle Works in Colorado. They require less air pressure, which drops in cold temperatures, and cover more surface area. Continental's Top Contact Winter II Premium tires, made of high-tech synthetic fibers, resist tears and have deep treads that grip slippery roads. You can also protect your standard tires with Tannus Armour's foam inserts (from $70, tannusamerica.com), which fit between the tire and the tube and make a wheel \"almost unflattable,\" said Mr. Jones.</p><p>Pedaling on wet roads can kick a muddy stripe up your back and make a mess of your drivechain (which includes cranks, cogs and derailleur). Fenders, like the clip-on SKS Raceblade Pro XL set, are your first line of defense against this and weather-related rust and corrosion, said Mr. Jones.</p><p>That kicked-up mess isn't just water and dirt; winter roads are rife with magnesium chloride, salt and de-icer. Those corrosive elements make cleaning your ride crucial to its longevity. \"You don't need to take a toothbrush to the cogs every day, but you should at least rinse and wipe down your bike once a week,\" said Mr. Varekamp. Using isopropyl alcohol on the braking surfaces can extract winter grime, boosting your braking power and elongating the lifespan of the pads, added Mr. Jones.</p><p>Extend your own life with clip-on lights that make you more visible to drivers during winter's shorter, grayer days. But just as the cold zaps an iPhone battery, frigid air can drain your lights' power. Opt for a handlebar light stronger than 500 lumens, said Mr. Jones, like the Cygolite Metro Plus 800 USB. With nine modes that unleash up to 800 lumens, it can be used at a low setting without sacrificing visibility or battery life.</p><p>And since it all easily clips on to the frame, your bike too can drop that excess winter weight once spring arrives.</p>",
