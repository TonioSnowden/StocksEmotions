  "text": "<p>Facebook also said Monday that it was changing its reporting structure to break out a unit called Facebook Reality Labs that encompasses augmented-reality and virtual-reality products and services. The move will separate results for that unit from the core business segment including its flagship Facebook platform and other apps such as Instagram. The company said it expects investment in Facebook Reality Labs to reduce its overall operating profit in 2021 by around $10 billion.</p><p>Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, on an analysts call, also addressed Facebook's growing competition for young adult users from Apple's iMessage app and the rise of ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok, saying that retaining and adding members of this demographic segment is essential for the company's long-term success. \"We are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their North Star, rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people,\" he said.</p><p>The earnings report comes amid a wave of tumult for Facebook that has been extraordinary even for a company that has weathered numerous controversies and challenges to its business in recent years.</p><p>In addition to the digital-ad industry disruption from Apple's change to its iOS mobile-operating system, Facebook has faced a firestorm of criticism from lawmakers, academics and users over revelations in The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series, which has showed that the company knows that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm. Those articles spurred congressional hearings, prompted a rebuke from Facebook's own oversight board, and led the company to halt work on a version of its Instagram app focused on children.</p><p>Facebook had previously warned that Apple's privacy changes to its iOS operating system could crimp ad-targeting capabilities in the third quarter, as more people update their iPhones and iPads. Last week Snap Inc. blamed the Apple policy for an expected slowdown in revenue growth, leading its stock price to fall more than 20%.</p><p>Facebook shares rose more than 3% in after-hours trading Monday, after ending the regular session up 1.3%. The company's shares had retreated 5% last week after Snap reported its advertising issues related to Apple's changes. \"Given the fear that was out there, this is fine, especially after Snap,\" said MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson.</p><p>Earlier Monday, Frances Haugen, the former Facebook employee who gathered company documents that informed the Journal's series, spoke to a U.K. parliamentary committee. She urged lawmakers to pass legislation to rein in social-media platforms, saying Facebook has trouble curbing misinformation and hate speech.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, on an analysts call, pushed back against criticism. \"I'm proud of our record navigating the complex trade-offs involved in operating services at global scale,\" he said. \"It makes a good sound bite to say that we don't solve these impossible trade-offs because we're just focused on making money, but the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business, but about balancing different difficult social values.\"</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said sales would have grown from the second quarter absent the Apple changes.</p><p>Third-quarter revenue reached $29.01 billion, up 35% from the year-ago period but below the $29.56 billion that analysts polled by FactSet were expecting. That was its slowest increase since last year's fourth quarter, and well below the 52% rate over the first half of this year.</p><p>Ad revenue declined slightly from the second quarter, including in the U.S. and Canada, its largest market segment. Facebook's third-quarter profit rose 17% to $9.19 billion. The company had 3.58 billion monthly users across Facebook, Instagram, and its other services -- up 12% from a year earlier.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
