  "text": "<p>“When it first came up I was a bit baffled to be honest and I think when most people first hear about it they're baffled too. They think, is he going to be putting coins on chains? Will it be copper pennies bashed together?” </p> <p>British jeweller Dominic Jones is talking about his new role as creative director of the Royal Mint, the UK's official coin maker and the country's oldest manufacturer. The debut collection of jewellery, plus a selection of homeware, launched in May at the Tower of London, where the Royal Mint first became a single institution in the year 886. The date gives the mint's new brand its name and, spoiler alert, there are no coins on chains, no bashed copper pennies. </p> <p>Buckinghamshire-born Jones, who came to fame with his debut collection in 2009, is a five-time winner of the British Fashion Council's New Gen award. His designs have been championed by the likes of Donatella Versace and Vogue editor Anna Wintour. He has previously been at the creative helm of fine and demi-fine jewellery brands Astley Clarke and Links of London, respectively. Jones refers to the idea behind 886 as “wearable bullion”.</p> <p>“It's an old-fashioned concept in culture to wear your gold assets on the body,” he says. “But it's something that in the last decade has become more important. With the rise of demi-fine and vermeil in contemporary jewellery — things that I have participated in and have been a big part of over the last few years — we've kind of lost the idea of the authenticity of the value of the materials. It sometimes feels like there's been intentional vagueness to confuse consumers into thinking they're buying one thing when they're buying another.” He uses the term “gold-dipped” as an example and suggests it implies a piece is gold rather than gold-plated. “So I liked the idea of creating a jewellery brand where you know that what you're buying is what you're getting.”</p> <p>There is no gold-plating or hollow metal in this collection of satisfyingly solid pieces — hoop and stud earrings, T-bar chains, bands, cuffs and cuff links, firmly aimed at the luxury market. Under the technical eye of Gordon Summers, chief engraver at the Royal Mint, Jones' designs are made in 18k gold, 9k gold, sterling silver and Britannia silver. They come in a variety of widths and weights, each one hallmarked with the gram weight so that the wearer will always know exactly how much of an asset they're carrying. An asset that is more useful than Apple Pay in a zombie apocalypse, Jones suggests.</p> <p>Those who first became aware of Jones thanks to his edgy pieces inspired by thorns and fangs, may be surprised by the straightforward aesthetic of this unisex collection, but Jones wanted to answer a design problem that he'd been aware of for some time. “As a multi-award winning jeweller who has dressed Beyoncé and David Bowie and done really wacky things,” he says, with a raised brow, “the main questions I get from friends are always: where can I buy a really simple beautiful gold chain? Where can I buy really simple gold hoops? Where can I buy a really tasteful wedding band?” Annoying perhaps when you're a creative known for constantly breaking new ground, but also as he came to realise, a welcome challenge. “I wanted to solve that problem and take a place in the market where if you want to buy a forever pair of gold hoops you come to us.”</p> <p>When Jones was told that the mint's key requirement was that everything be made in the UK, he knew that going for the highest quality was the only way to go. “You can't go up against the mid-market when the other brands have the capability to produce with the cheapest manufacturers,” he says. “It could only be a luxury jewellery brand. So that defined the positioning.” A positioning that befits a heritage company whose warden and then master in the late 17th century was Sir Isaac Newton. </p> <p>Science has contributed to a pioneering element of the collection. The Royal Mint claims it is the first luxury jewellery brand to use 100 per cent recovered gold sourced from electronic waste. The mint has partnered with the Canadian clean technology company Excir to extract pure gold from discarded laptops and mobile phones. A chemical formula strips over 99 per cent of the gold contained within used electronics, providing a fresh source of high-quality precious metal. </p> <p>The majority of the jewellery and homeware are crafted by reskilled employees at Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, south Wales. They have adopted the time-old technique of striking, done by hand with a hammer, and which was once used in the manufacture of coins and medals. The result is a more dense metal than when using the more usual contemporary method of casting, where liquified metal is poured into a mould. </p> <p>“The measures of success the mint is holding us to aren't just financial,” says Jones. “They want me to think about how we are going to be building British manufacturing, how we are going to upskill and create apprenticeship schemes, supporting the regeneration of craftsmanship in metal work and how we can interact with other institutions and educational bodies.” The Royal Mint has committed to taking on 10 apprentices a year and further education and training schemes will be announced in the final quarter of this year.</p> <p>At the core of the collection is the shape of the institutional gold bar, cherished by fantasy bank robbers. Jones inverted the trapezoid so that its narrower top became its bottom, reshaped all of the edges into curves and extended it into a rod. He shows me the gold band he's wearing on one of his hands: “When you wear it, it's this quite dense solid-looking piece, but it slightly hovers above the finger. It looks like it's floating.” The band may appear simple, but it took Jones 45 iterations before he felt he'd got it right. “It's more complicated than anything I'd designed in a while,” he says.</p> <p>There is romance here too, both highly technical and traditional. The technical can be seen in the use of optical caustics, a proprietary technique used by the Royal Mint as a security feature, available in this collection on cufflinks. Through striking and engraving, a hallmark design almost invisible to the eye is imprinted into the surface of the metal. Under a certain angle of light it will, says Jones, “fire out a kind of Batman signal of the design”. As for tradition, in a different take on the idea of hidden features, a cuff is engraved on the edge with lines of poetry in praise of silver and gold by, respectively, Walter de la Mare and Thomas Hood. </p> <p>“It's a secret, a piece of design for the wearer. Other people can't see it but you can take it off and show them,” says Jones who fell in love with jewellery as a child when his grandmother used to take off her own to distract him at the dinner table. “Jewellery should always have an element of being valid pirate treasure.” Can there be a better place to seek out bounty — or create it — than The Royal Mint?</p> <p><a href=\"https://886.royalmint.com/\"><em>886.royalmint.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Kate Finnigan 2022 '‘Wearable' bullion from the Royal Mint takes off' FT.com 20 June.
