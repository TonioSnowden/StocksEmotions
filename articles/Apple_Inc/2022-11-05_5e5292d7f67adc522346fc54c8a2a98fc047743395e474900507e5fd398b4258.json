  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Eating & Drinking: This Turkey Is No Turkey --- Had the Pilgrims sailed from Tuscany, they might have served a bird this delicious",
  "text": "<p>I have two restaurants in Portland, Ore. -- Nostrana and Oven and Shaker -- both of which fortunately survived the pandemic. But back in 2020, I was filling my days with lots of home cooking and hours of food conversations with my mentor, friend and culinary inspiration, Judy Witts Francini, an American who lives and cooks in Certaldo, Italy, her husband's hometown in Tuscany. Judy knows how crazy I am about all things pork, and in particular my devotion to porchetta, a Tuscan specialty. She suggested I make turchetta for Thanksgiving, solving two problems: my lack of interest in cooking a giant bird and unwillingness to eat bland roast turkey.</p><p>Though porchetta has many expressions, the basic concept is a boneless pork loin or pork shoulder that's butterflied, spread with herbs and garlic. The pork is then rolled up, creating a pinwheel effect on the interior. That rolled pork is then wrapped in pork belly with its skin and roasted. You end up with concentric circles of deliciousness, with a crispy exterior and a savory, moist interior. Porchetta is served sliced, on its own or in a sandwich.</p><p>Using boneless turkey breast instead of boneless pork isn't a one-for-one substitution, however. For starters, turkey breast is very lean. I'd have to do something to add fatty goodness to the turkey -- hello, Parmigiano and prosciutto! And while I consider pork the most flavorful meat, turkey breast is better as a vehicle for other flavors than as a meat with a distinctive character of its own.</p><p>Cooks have been playing with the turchetta concept for years and using various ways to add flavor and fat to the situation. Some opt for wrapping the turkey breast in bacon, or stuffing the interior with mozzarella; most use the classic porchetta seasonings of rosemary and/or sage, garlic and fennel seed.</p><p>Using Judy's turchetta recipe as my guide, I decided to go \"classic Italian\" all the way, with sliced garlic, ground fennel seed and fresh rosemary and sage as the seasonings, along with a generous amount of Parmigiano-Reggiano as both a flavor and fat enhancement. With a layer of thinly sliced prosciutto I brought some pork into the picture after all.</p><p>I butterflied a turkey breast and pounded it out to an even thickness with a flat mallet. Then I layered on all those good things, rolled up the breast and tied it so the skin would stay in place on the outside.</p><p>Porchetta is usually served on its own, but given that this dish was to be the centerpiece for a holiday meal, I thought a sauce would be appropriate. After browning the rolled turkey breast on the stovetop in some garlic and rosemary-scented olive oil, I added red wine to the pan, let it reduce a bit, and then transferred the pan to the oven.</p><p>As the turchetta roasted, the wine mixed with the turkey juices (and some escaped Parmigiano, no doubt), and the whole thing reduced into a savory sauce. I whisked in some butter for added richness. And I knew this Thanksgiving wouldn't be our last to feature turchetta.</p><p>A Thanksgiving meal isn't only about the turkey, of course. You could pair the turchetta with whatever traditional sides your family likes (or expects), but I tend to lean into simple Italian vegetable preparations: Creamy white beans simmered with sage, whole garlic cloves, and olive oil. Broccoli rabe boiled until tender and then sauteed with garlic and chile flakes. Roasted potatoes with rosemary and garlic. Are you detecting a theme here? Garlic is certainly an ingredient to give thanks for.</p><p>For dessert, perhaps an all-American pumpkin tart. And let's not forget the all-important Thanksgiving leftovers. Mix apple butter with a dollop of Dijon mustard, spread it on a roll, stuff the roll with sliced turchetta, and you have a very fine next-day sandwich.</p><p>---</p><p>Turchetta</p><p>This roast turkey breast stuffed and rolled in the style of Tuscan porchetta makes a delicious alternative to the same old Thanksgiving bird. Use a flat meat pounder -- not a meat tenderizing mallet, which has spikes -- to pound out the breast to an even thickness. To help prevent tearing, place the breast between sheets of plastic wrap or dampen the pounder's surface with water.</p><p>Total Time: 2 hours</p><p>Serves: 4 with leftovers</p><p>1 boneless half turkey breast, skin on (2-3 pounds)</p><p>9 cloves garlic, 8 peeled and very thinly sliced, 1 unpeeled and lightly mashed</p><p>Leaves from 1 large bunch fresh sage (20-30 small-medium leaves)</p><p>4 teaspoons fennel seeds, ground</p><p>1/2 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano (1 cup if using microplane)</p><p>6 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto</p><p>5 tablespoons olive oil</p><p>1 sprig of rosemary</p><p>2 cups red wine</p><p>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p><p>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</p><p>2. On a cutting board, lay breast out, skin-side down. Use a sharp knife to make a vertical cut down the middle, only going about 2/3 of the way down. You do not want to cut in half completely or cut to the skin.</p><p>3. Holding blade parallel to surface of meat, butterfly one side by making a horizontal cut from center to edge, about 1/2 way through the thickness of the meat, as if you are opening up the breast like a book. Do not cut all the way through the meat. Stop when meat is still attached by about 3/4 inch at edge. Repeat on the other side.</p><p>4. Turkey breast should now be able to lay flat like an open book. Use a meat mallet to pound out so thickness is uniform and you have a nice rectangle shape.</p><p>5. Cover meat evenly with garlic slices. Cover garlic evenly with sage leaves. Mix fennel and Parmesan together, and spread evenly on top. Layer prosciutto slices on top of that. Roll up breast from one narrow end to the other, leaving skin exposed. Tie with kitchen twine to form a compact roll.</p><p>6. In a roasting pan, heat 5 tablespoons olive oil with mashed garlic clove and rosemary sprig over medium heat. Add rolled turkey and brown on all sides. Pour in wine, bring to a simmer and transfer pan to oven. Roast until internal temperature is about 145 degrees, 25-30 minutes. Transfer turkey to a platter and let rest 15-20 minutes. Set pan with wine over medium heat to reduce to sauce consistency, if it's not already there, and whisk in butter.</p><p>7. Carve turkey in thick slices, crosswise, to reveal pinwheel pattern. Serve with sauce. Use leftovers for sandwiches or a charcuterie board.</p>",
