  "title": "Spotify Rival Deezer's Shares Fall in Trading Debut; French music-streaming service went public via a SPAC deal, but has yet to strike a profit",
  "text": "<p>Deezer's downbeat debut is a sign that there are limits to the investor appetite for music-streaming services, even as such offerings have grown to become a major source of revenue for the music industry. In addition to Spotify, Deezer faces competition from Apple Music's and Amazon.com Inc.'s similar services, which benefit from their larger scale and alternative sources of revenue.</p><p>Shares in technology companies have been trading down this year. Rising inflation and fears of a recession have put particularly heavy pressure on startups—some of which have taken haircuts in recent fundraising.</p><p>A person close to Deezer said that the company expected volatility in the first days of trading and that its prospects are strong.</p><p>The company, which reported an operating loss of 120.6 million euros in 2021, equivalent to $124 million, said earlier this year that it is aiming to reach €1 billion revenue by 2025 and be profitable that same year. At the end of June last year, Deezer had about 2% share of the global music streaming market measured by subscribers, far behind its largest competitors, according to Midia, a data provider.</p><p>Deezer's two largest markets are France, where it has a 29% market share, and Brazil, where it has 17% of the market. The French music-streaming service typically strikes partnerships with media or telecoms groups to enter new markets. It is currently betting on a big expansion of its user base in Germany via a deal with a local broadcaster, and has said it is also having discussions about U.S. expansion.</p><p>Founded in 2007, Deezer has had mixed success capitalizing on the boom in music streaming. In 2015, the company abandoned plans for an initial public offering, after a drop in active listeners at internet radio operator Pandora triggered concerns about the outlook for streaming services. Pandora was subsequently acquired in 2018 by Sirius XM Holdings Inc.</p><p>Other streaming-media companies have seen steep declines in their stock prices in recent months. Spotify's shares are down 60% since the beginning of the year. Netflix Inc.'s stock is down 70%.</p><p>Deezer's share decline comes as SPAC transactions have fallen out of favor, after a flurry of deals in recent years.</p><p>In such deals, so-called blank-check companies raise money by going public and then have a set period to hunt for an acquisition target. They can offer companies a quicker way to go public than the traditional IPO route. But some companies following that path have faced investor pushback because they have struggled to meet their business targets.</p><p>Deezer's public debut on Tuesday came via a merger with a blank-check company backed by France's Pinault family, the controlling shareholder of Gucci-owner Kering, as well as Centerview Partners banker Matthieu Pigasse. The vehicle was headed by former WarnerMedia executive Iris Knobloch, who has become Deezer's vice chairwoman.</p><p>Write to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com</p><p>Spotify Rival Deezer's Shares Fall in Trading Debut</p>",
