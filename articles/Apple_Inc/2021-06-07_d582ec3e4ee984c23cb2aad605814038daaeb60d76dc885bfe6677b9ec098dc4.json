It said its London office rents had fallen more than 10 per cent in the past year amid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f1754e5-8449-4dde-878c-f06f02f23935\">“a lot of customer distress</a>”.</p> <p>These are just some of the latest examples of how pandemic uncertainty has convulsed the market for office real estate. As Robert Armstrong writes in today's edition of his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e8eff67-ea85-465f-bae8-d589f6354041\">Unhedged newsletter</a>, we really have very little idea of what demand will look like once we return to some kind of normality. </p> <p>“Will we need 10 per cent less, as more workers work from home at least some of the time? Or will it be more like 20 per cent less? Even less than that? I would absolutely hate to bet money on this,” he says. You can almost “smell the fear” of real estate companies as they struggle to convince investors that the era of big offices is not yet done, he adds.&#xa0;</p> <p>The future of the office, “now the number one topic in our industry,” according to a real estate banker quoted by Robert, was also the subject of today's <a href=\"https://futureworkplace.live.ft.com/home\">FT Live event</a>. </p> <p>Discussions ranged from the reconfiguration of buildings as more flexible employee-led spaces to the impact of changes in working patterns and can be viewed on demand via the link below.&#xa0; </p> <p>The debate about where employees are located has implications far beyond real estate, according to workplace expert Chris Kane, who spoke at today's conference. </p> <p>He cited the pushback from <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/06/05/apple-employees-wrote-a-letter-to-ceo-tim-cook-saying-why-they-dont-want-to-return-to-the-office/\">Apple staff</a> who are resisting the call to return to the office. “I think bosses too are starting to accept that the employer-employee game has changed fundamentally. The war for talent will rage like never before,” he said.</p> <p><em>You can watch sessions from today's Future of Work event by </em><a href=\"https://futureworkplace.live.ft.com/page/1704936/register-now\"><em>registering here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p><strong>China's trade surge</strong> over the past year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40c63537-6b02-42a3-b72a-498457076319#post-f3c2d209-f8ba-4bda-817c-f5ca263e2ca6\">could be slowing down</a>, according to new data that showed exports and imports rose at a slower than expected pace last month. Analysts believe global demand for Chinese goods, including sectors that have done well out of the pandemic such as electronics and medical equipment, may have peaked.</p> <p>Small US businesses that are unable to offer the pay and incentives of larger companies are struggling to cope with <strong>labour shortages</strong>, resorting to tactics such as offering job applicants <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcec9d72-8557-44f1-a629-feb580e2dcb7\">the chance to win a car</a>. In the UK, economic reopening is improving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/586fdd41-36b6-4c89-8b37-6370bcc7078d\">prospects for low-paid workers</a>. Labour shortages are a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b40d77f2-fa02-4c7b-8eee-59cbd0a40e51\">good problem to have</a>, the FT Editorial Board writes, but policymakers need to keep a watchful eye on how the market develops. </p> <p>The final instalment in our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6dfb1dc-eb86-4bad-87b0-d800b79195d3\">series on inflation</a> looks at its possible consequences for <strong>developing countries</strong> that are simultaneously mired in the battle against coronavirus. A rise in the cost of borrowing could seriously damage their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1db3d119-ac9f-4948-b43b-29bb136eb2d5\">already fragile public finances</a>. </p> <h1>Business</h1> <p>The global <strong>semiconductor shortage</strong> that originated during the pandemic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04858089-fbe7-44f1-b096-8e705c664f8e\">will last at least until mid-2022</a>, according to Flex, one of the world's largest electronics contract manufacturers. Chipmakers have been unable to keep up with demand from the swift bounceback in car sales that has followed the huge lockdown demand for consumer electronics.</p> <p>Ride-hailing business <strong>Uber</strong> said bookings in the UK and across Europe were now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d577e2b5-b7e0-449d-a3ac-78f16a808546\">at or close to 2019 levels</a> with the company still to benefit from the return of business travel and tourism. Operations in big UK cities such as Birmingham are having trouble finding enough drivers.</p> <p><strong>Dating apps</strong> in the UK have added another reason to swipe right: users on platforms such as Tinder and Bumble can now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40c63537-6b02-42a3-b72a-498457076319#post-7fce5e47-5d2f-4a5c-854b-adc9ff5e55b9\">display their vaccination status</a> in an initiative supported by the government. A recent poll found that 31 per cent of adults would prefer to date someone who was vaccinated, while a further 28 per cent would not date someone unless they had received a jab.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>As companies <strong>bounce back</strong> from the pandemic, investors are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7b5cdcc-921b-412d-9789-519e12a54104\">piling into dividend-paying stocks</a>. An investment officer at BlackRock explained the surge: “What's happened here is just a sense of, OK, the coast is clear, we don't have to worry about dividend cuts any more, let's put our money back into income-producing equities.” </p> <p>The timing of the Federal Reserve's move to wind down pandemic support measures could yet bring a “sticky summer” for Wall Street, writes US investment editor <strong>Michael Mackenzie. </strong>Investors looking for longer-term possibilities should look to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00fe4743-60dd-4c84-867f-5c13d6df43d5\">European and global equities</a>, he says.</p> <p><strong>Ruchir Sharma</strong>, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, advises investors not to dismiss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/199bb5b9-e5e3-4f3a-9fa1-8a880c269d3f\">market bubbles</a> totally, such as those involving hot pandemic stocks. For every group of flops there are usually a handful of companies that provide long-term innovation, he writes. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p>Spaceteddy comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b937265c-8bb1-4cab-9234-c7458e0b86a2?commentID=59bcda4b-7b9a-4fab-bac0-8162affa487c\">Wizz Air takes on the airline zombies created by state aid</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The countries that have bailed out their airlines are looking for stability. They need the wide network that these airlines provide to facilitate business travel, exports and investments. It is in their interest to support the hub and spoke model of these airlines. Low cost airlines cannot provide this as they lack the long-haul connectivity and the hub-and-spoke operating model. This connectivity is essential for the large airlines to keep the network and schedules needed.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>Environmental concerns over agriculture are contributing to a growing buzz over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/252c7358-8fcd-46e4-b500-4b06922d7f6c\">insects as food for humans</a> — but can we overcome the “ick” factor?
