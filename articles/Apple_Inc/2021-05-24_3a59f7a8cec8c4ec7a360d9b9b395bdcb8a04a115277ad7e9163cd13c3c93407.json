  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Lina Khan, a progressive champion nominated by President Biden for a key enforcement post, wants to transform antitrust policy into a bulwark against corporate power by blocking more mergers, attacking monopolistic practices and potentially breaking up some of America's largest companies. </p><p>   Ms. Khan, 32 years old, is awaiting Senate confirmation for a Democratic seat on the five-member Federal Trade Commission after she was cleared by the Senate Commerce Committee. She has risen to prominence -- and gained bipartisan support -- as Democrats and Republicans alike have said lax antitrust enforcement, especially in the tech sector, has allowed dominant firms to hobble rivals and stifle competition. </p><p>   Her targets have included not just Big Tech. She has argued for hawkish positions that would overhaul legal doctrine and go well beyond the approach of recent antitrust enforcers. While her most ardent supporters believe such changes are long overdue, her views have prompted a debate on whether her approach is realistic and potentially so sweeping that it could prove jarring to the economy. </p><p>   \"Stepped-up antitrust enforcement is one thing,\" said Howard University law professor Andrew Gavil, who was a top FTC staffer the last time Democrats controlled the commission. \"Changing the standards is a different matter.\" </p><p>   If confirmed, Ms. Khan, a professor at Columbia Law School, would join an agency that enforces antitrust and consumer-protection laws across the economy. She would further cement the rise of a progressive camp that believes the U.S. faces what she has described as \"a sweeping market power problem\" in which large firms have become too dominant. </p><p>   \"Lina has been very clear-eyed in recognizing that the core questions have to do with power, with the ability of private entities to coerce and to bully,\" said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy group. </p><p>   A London-born immigrant who came to the U.S. at age 11, Ms. Khan is soft-spoken and a prolific writer. During her teenage years in the New York City area, she worked on the student newspaper at Mamaroneck High School. She gained prominence through her criticism of Amazon.com Inc., writing a widely read law-review article while a student at Yale Law School that argued that antitrust law has failed to restrain the online retailer. </p><p>   Ms. Khan has rocketed through the progressive ranks, sounding the alarm on corporate concentration in industries ranging from airlines to agriculture. \"Big chocolate is about to get even bigger,\" she wrote in a 2013 article criticizing consolidation in the world market for cocoa processing. </p><p>   People close to Ms. Khan said she sees herself as an intellectual leader in an antimonopoly movement, one that views unchecked corporate power as a threat to democracy. </p><p>   She was a House staffer on a congressional antitrust panel that conducted a 16-month investigation of large online platforms and last year recommended that lawmakers take steps to rein them in. She served as legal director of the Open Markets Institute, a group that favors aggressive trustbusting. </p><p>   Ms. Khan, who declined to comment, would join an FTC that scrutinizes mergers and business practices to determine whether they illegally suppress competition in the marketplace. She has argued the framework for enforcing U.S. antitrust laws is misguided because it favors corporate efficiency and short-term consumer welfare interests over a competitive structure in which a healthy number of rival firms keep one another in check. </p><p>   Democrats have embraced Ms. Khan's arguments that enforcement has been inadequate, supporting tougher action by the FTC and the Justice Department, as well as legislation to strengthen antitrust laws. Some, however, have said the FTC can change its approach without embracing Ms. Khan's philosophical shift away from how enforcers have thought about the law for decades. </p><p>   Republicans are more reserved on potential legislative changes and have been critical of Ms. Khan's central argument that antitrust policy should focus on more than just consumer welfare. Some have worried that her views would lead to interference across industries, even as they support her positions against Big Tech. </p><p>   Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, top Republican on a Senate antitrust panel, voted against Ms. Khan in the Senate Commerce Committee and said liberal changes aren't needed. \"Our laws could meet the need if only enforcers brought the appropriate facts and the appropriate evidence,\" he said during her confirmation hearing. </p><p>   The House antitrust report concluded that Amazon, Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. wield monopoly power -- and criticized U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies as failing to curb their dominance. </p><p>   All four companies disputed the committee report's findings and declined to comment on Ms. Khan's nomination. </p><p></p>",
