  "title": "Dallas Cowboys Paid $2.4 Million in Settlements Over Cheerleader Allegations; NFL team says it found no wrongdoing, but settled with four cheerleaders in 2016 after they accused an executive of being in their locker room while they undressed",
  "text": "<p>In a statement to ESPN, which earlier reported the settlement, Dalrymple denied any wrongdoing. He didn't respond to a request for comment by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>In a statement, a spokesman for the team said the allegations were investigated thoroughly at the time and no wrongdoing was found.</p><p>\"The investigation was handled consistent with best legal and HR practices and the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. If any wrongdoing had been found Rich would have been terminated immediately,\" team spokesman Jim Wilkinson said. \"The cheerleaders are a vital part of the Dallas Cowboys family, and in terms of the settlement, the organization wanted to go above and beyond to ensure the cheerleaders knew that their allegations had been taken extremely seriously, and immediately and thoroughly investigated.\"</p><p>The incident occurred on Sept. 2, 2015, the person familiar with the matter said. The four cheerleaders reported their allegations to the team's human-resources department that day, and one of them reported seeing an arm holding a phone while they undressed. She told the team she ran over and saw Dalrymple and then he ran out of the room.</p><p>The team's investigation immediately began with seven interviews: the four cheerleaders, a security guard in the area and two other potential witnesses, according to the person familiar with the matter. The team's legal counsel also interviewed Dalrymple and seized his iPhone, the person said, while obtaining the password to his iCloud account. A forensics firm studied the phone and found no pictures or videos of the cheerleaders nor any evidence that anything had been deleted.</p><p>Dalrymple told investigators he was in the room for a matter of seconds before leaving, and that he had gone in there to use the bathroom, the person said.</p><p>Months later, in May 2016, the team and Dalrymple agreed to the $2.4 million settlement with the cheerleaders in which Dalrymple denied the allegation of voyeurism.</p><p>As the matter progressed, Dalrymple also faced an accusation on social media that someone saw him take an \"upskirt\" photo of Charlotte Jones Anderson—an executive vice president with the team and Jerry Jones's daughter—during a video that aired during the NFL draft. The team dismissed that allegation.</p><p>\"The most basic common sense tells you that if Jerry Jones believed in any way that someone had even remotely done something like that to any member of his family, that person would have been fired immediately,\" Wilkinson said in a statement.</p><p>Dalrymple is no longer an executive for the team after stepping down earlier this month.</p><p>The disclosure of the settlement, just a few days after the Super Bowl, adds to the list of scandals inside the National Football League. In recent weeks, Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder was accused of sexual misconduct; a former coach has sued the league, accusing it of racial discrimination in its hiring practices; and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross was accused of offering to pay that coach $100,000 per loss to intentionally lose games and secure a top draft pick.</p><p>Snyder, who had previously denied prior accusations of wrongdoing while his team was under investigation for workplace misconduct, denied this latest one. Ross said the allegation against him is false. An NFL spokesman said the lawsuit by former Dolphins coach Brian Flores is meritless while commissioner Roger Goodell said the league has fallen short in its hiring practices.</p><p>The Cowboys incident also invigorates questions about the treatment of women—and cheerleaders in particular—inside the sport. The Washington NFL team introduced a coed dance team in 2021 after years of accusations of impropriety roiled the outfit. The most recent accusation of sexual misconduct against Snyder, aired during a roundtable hosted by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, came from a former cheerleader.</p><p>Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com</p><p>Dallas Cowboys Paid $2.4 Million in Settlements Over Cheerleader Allegations</p>",
