  "text": "<p>    Spotify Technology SA's big bet on podcasts appears to be paying off. </p><p>   Third-quarter advertising revenue increased 75% from a year earlier, and user growth picked up after a lull earlier this year, the company reported Wednesday. Spotify is now the top podcast platform in the U.S. by listeners, according to Edison Research, passing incumbent Apple Podcasts in the largest market. </p><p>   \"Getting into this, people questioned how we were going to handle the large podcast platforms and how we'd fare,\" Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek said in an interview. \"We were right in our investments three years ago, and it's paying off.\" </p><p>   At the end of the quarter, Spotify had 381 million monthly active users, up 19% from a year earlier and at the high end of the company's expectations. Paying subscribers, its most lucrative type of customer, also climbed 19% to 172 million, in line with the company's guidance range. </p><p>   Shares in the Swedish streamer rose 8.3% to $273.13. </p><p>   Earlier this year executives said Spotify faced uncertainty as the emerging markets it is relying on for new user growth endured Covid-19 increases. The company said it resumed marketing and promotion efforts in countries where it had taken a pause, helping an uplift particularly in India. </p><p>   \"The choppiness we saw in the first half of the year was due to Covid, and there are still markets being impacted by Covid, but across the board in our larger markets it looks like it's largely behind us,\" Mr. Ek said. </p><p>   Average revenue per user for the subscription business in the quarter climbed 4% to 4.34 euros, equivalent to $5.03. That is a turnaround for the metric, which has been declining for years as the company attracted new subscribers through discounted plans and lower prices in newer markets. Last fall, Spotify began raising the price of its family plan in dozens of markets, including the U.S. It said those increases have finally helped lift per-user revenue. </p><p>   Revenue from subscriptions jumped 22% to 2.18 billion euros. Advertising revenue rose to 323 million euros. Advertising, which typically has accounted for around 10% of overall revenue, has become a particular growth area as Spotify expands its podcast business. During the quarter, it made up about 13% of total revenue, and the company expects to pass 1 billion euros in ad revenue for the first time this year. </p><p>   The company highlighted double-digit year-over-year gains at existing Spotify studios -- the Ringer, Parcast, Spotify Studios and Gimlet -- and growth from its acquisition of podcast-ad firm Megaphone as well as its exclusively licensed podcasts \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" \"Armchair Expert\" and \"Call Her Daddy.\" The company also said since the rollout of Spotify Audience Network, which lets advertisers buy spots targeting audiences rather than on specific shows, the number of the network's podcasts has grown by over 50%, and nearly one in five Spotify advertisers are participating. </p><p>   Spotify said it has 3.2 million podcasts available on its service, up from 2.9 million in the prior quarter. While podcasts remain a drag on gross margins, over time the company expects that to flip, and pointed to strong engagement podcasts have fostered, which helps keep users on the service. </p><p>   Overall for the quarter, revenue rose 27% to 2.5 billion euros. Spotify swung to a profit of 2 million euros from a loss of 101 million euros a year earlier. </p><p></p>",
