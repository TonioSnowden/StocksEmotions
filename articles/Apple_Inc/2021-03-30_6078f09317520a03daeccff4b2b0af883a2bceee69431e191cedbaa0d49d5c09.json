  "text": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6pOF09Cidw&amp;t=1199s\">Akira Yoshino</a> delivered his Nobel lecture in late 2019, he was everything an audience could want in a 71-year-old Japanese industrial chemist: impishly brilliant, affably clumsy with PowerPoint and modest about transforming modern life on planet Earth. </p> <p>The developer of the lithium-ion battery, who had just been awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry along with two other pioneers, merrily recalled a life of incremental innovation at a Japanese corporation. His battery prototype, whose successors deliver the juice to our phones, laptops, e-cigarettes, drones, robots and, increasingly, cars, was initially mass-produced by Sony, then put to work both creating and dominating the market for portable video cameras in the early 1990s. </p> <p>Panasonic remains a leader in the technology, but that breakthrough 30 years ago was among the last times that Japan could run so gloriously unopposed in such a critical technology field.</p>  <p><strong>When I caught up with Yoshino in March</strong> over Zoom, the mood was subtly different from his 2019 speech. His optimism remains infectious, as does his boundless fascination with the possibilities of battery technology. He still takes a direct interest in the great theoretical and practical debates about lithium batteries. But he feels those debates are shadowed by the drumbeat of tech war and protectionism.</p> <p>The past year, framed by US-China trade friction at the start and a worldwide <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f77a307-3fd1-4493-a4c8-55987ec2e573\">chip shortage</a> at the end, has laid bare, to a global gaze, how fragile technology supply chains are. Many of these remain intact, but others await suture or stent and others still may fall to the scalpel.&#xa0;</p> <p>The effect of this exposure has been to underline a double fragility — first, to whatever problems nature, geopolitics, accidents, malice or blocked shipping canals happen to generate in any given week; and, second, to the knee-jerk or nationalist solutions often promised as answers to those events.&#xa0;</p> <p>There is already a sense that lithium batteries are poised for three distinct tipping points. The first of these, suggests Yoshino, is the dangled promise that batteries, thanks to improvements in fundamental science, will offer significantly faster charging times and, for electric vehicles, much longer range. </p> <p>“Basically, when a new innovation is born, you need two breakthroughs,” he says. “One is in basic research, the other is actually mass-producing it. A breakthrough isn't real until you have both.”</p> <p>There are rival theories about how best to achieve this but Yoshino is most interested in the quest for a lithium battery that exploits the superior safety and efficiency of a solid — as opposed to the current liquid — electrolyte. The race is run with a thrilling urgency between the established titans (Toyota has grandly promised a prototype later this year) and disruptive newcomers (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c31ca3ce-5e83-452c-86cb-3d1646490c7a\">QuantumScape</a>, a Volkswagen-backed Silicon Valley start-up, already has a solid-state battery).</p> <p>The second is the assumption that lithium-battery vehicles will soon account for a much larger share of global car sales than the 2019 figure of&#xa0;2.6 per cent — even in its current off-peak form, Tesla's share price is a testament to that. But arguably the more intriguing drama will be how the incumbents — Toyota, GM, VW and others — defend their positions.</p> <p>The third factor is the realisation among certain governments that the next phase of the epic, lithium-centric industrial transformation is imminent and that the cost of being one of its losers will be intolerably high.</p> <p>Japan might have certain advantages, Yoshino says, but “the auto industry is a huge industry”, and many other countries will also be making electric vehicles. Europe is becoming a battleground among battery makers and their suppliers as the continent's carmakers envisage a more self-contained supply chain and increase pressure on battery makers to build factories in Europe. </p> <p>Beijing is already using its “Made in China 2025” national plan to define its ambition of mastering the technologies it lacks. Batteries are a central pillar of that. In the US, chip shortages and other issues about long-term supply have clearly become a matter of concern for the Biden administration. </p> <p>Japan's answer is a proposal for an “All Japan” project to re-establish battery dominance. The nation that invented and commercialised these world-changing devices is driven by a terror that losing the battery race portends a more calamitous loss of industrial prowess. Now everyone else is too.</p> <p><em>Leo Lewis is the FT's Asia business editor</em></p> <p><em>Follow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.
