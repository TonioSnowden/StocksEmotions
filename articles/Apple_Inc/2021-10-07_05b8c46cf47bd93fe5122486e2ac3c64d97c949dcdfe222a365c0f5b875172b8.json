  "text": "<p>\n  At least two unique looks at the service industry are streaming this week: one involving blue skies and marriage proposals at a Mexico resort, the other filled with baked goods and safety belts. Plus, Peacock launches a high-school murder mystery. </p><p>\n  Here's where to find the shows, all new releases. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Acapulco' </p><p>\n  (Apple TV+) </p><p>\n  During the shooting of the 2017 film \"How to Be a Latin Lover,\" the creators and its star, Eugenio Derbez, started talking about the origin story of the gigolo at the center of the movie. What was he like as a teenager? How many women had he dated before he got to where he is in the film? </p><p>\n  \"Acapulco,\" the bilingual series that premieres Friday on Apple TV+, ended up being something else completely. Partway into development, Mr. Derbez says, they didn't want young Maximo to be a social climber or a womanizer. They wanted to tell the story of a young man who wants to do the right thing to succeed. </p><p>\n  \"The series is about the price that you're willing to pay to achieve your dreams,\" says Mr. Derbez. \"Because this guy wants to work to bring his family to a better life. But what's the price that you need to pay for that?\" </p><p>\n  The comedic series stars Mr. Derbez as adult Maximo, a wealthy uncle telling his nephew the story of his upbringing. Young Maximo, played by Enrique Arrizon, is naive and idealistic. He lands a dream job as a cabana boy at the local resort in the 1980s. But when guests ask him to hustle up a few joints, he is forced to decide between making money to help his family and making decisions that would make his mother proud. </p><p>\n  Although the two Maximos of \"Latin Lover\" and \"Acapulco\" work in different professions, they are both in the service industry. Mr. Derbez -- one of Mexico's biggest screen stars -- feels he is working in the service industry as well. Early in his career, the owner of a network told him that some of his viewers might not be able to afford much, but they did own a television. Working on a comedy that people could laugh at was an important social service. </p><p>\n  \"And I didn't get it then. I was like, What are you talking about?\" says Mr. Derbez, adding: \"One hundred percent, now I get it.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Baking Impossible' </p><p>\n  (Netflix) </p><p>\n  A new entry in the rapidly growing subgenre of baking reality shows, \"Baking Impossible\" shakes up the format by teaming bakers with engineers: \"bakineers,\" if you will. The show's competition isn't just about who can bake the best cake, but who can use baked goods to, say, create safety features for a car that will protect a crash dummy. </p><p>\n  While the premise might sound preposterous, the show, now streaming on Netflix, does give insight into baking in the real world. </p><p>\n  \"Baking Impossible\" judge Joanne Chang, a chef and co-owner of the Boston area's Flour Bakery &amp; Cafe, says that for those who bake professionally, the challenges are a lot more involved than creating something that looks and tastes delicious. You also have to bake things that can be produced on a larger scale, that will stay fresh in the case, that will fit into a clamshell and that can be prepared in a short amount of time, often in small spaces. </p><p>\n  \"And that's so similar to the challenges that the bakineers have,\" she says, \"which is, OK, make a great cake, but also make it wiggle, make it drive, make it flow.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'One of Us Is Lying' </p><p>\n  (Peacock) </p><p>\n  Five high-school students find themselves in detention in the first episode of Peacock's \"One of Us Is Lying.\" </p><p>\n  The odd man out is Simon, who runs an app that reveals the secrets of his classmates. </p><p>\n  The other four have secrets they don't want spilled: Cooper is a baseball player whose sexual orientation is under wraps; Addy cheated on her boyfriend; Nate is on probation but is still dealing drugs; Bronwyn is one of the best students in her class, her sights set on Yale, with a lot to lose. </p><p>\n  Detention is interrupted by Simon's death. The creators of the show, which premieres Thursday and is based on Karen McManus's best-selling novel of the same name, spend eight episodes unspooling who did it. </p><p>\n  Erica Saleh, one of the show's writers and executive producers, says that when she read the novel, she could see how the modern story of social media was also a timeless one. </p><p>\n  \"When we were in high school, it was maybe not online, but certainly the idea of someone knowing a secret about you or gossip spreading about you being able to ruin your life is something that we can all feel really viscerally,\" she says. </p><p></p>",
