  "text": "<p><strong>Cath Noakes, 46, professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, specialises in airborne infections and the transport of airborne pathogens. A member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), she is a key Covid adviser. She was appointed OBE in 2020 for services to the Covid-19 response.</strong></p> <p><strong>What was your childhood or earliest ambition?</strong><br>To be an artist. That spread into design and technical drawing, which then took me to engineering. </p> <p><strong>Private school or state school? University or straight into work?</strong><br>State school: New Mills primary, then New Mills secondary school and sixth form, in north Derbyshire. Then the University of Leeds to study mathematical engineering — and I haven't left! </p> <p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor?</strong><br>I've never had a formal mentor, but lots of people have given me support, both inside and outside academia. </p> <p><strong>How physically fit are you?</strong><br>I've never been particularly fit, though I enjoy the outdoors — walking, attempting to mountain bike, the odd bit of a run.</p> <p><strong>Ambition or talent: which matters more to success?</strong><br>You need a bit of both, and a few other things too: enthusiasm, a really good team and a bit of luck. Success isn't about individuals, it's about what they achieve together. Success to me is what I've achieved with other people, for other people. </p> <p><strong>How politically committed are you?</strong><br>I wouldn't say I'm particularly active but over the past few years I've become much more politically aware: Brexit, climate change, the recognition of social injustice in the world. You realise how much of that is determined politically. </p> <p><strong>What would you like to own that you don't currently possess?</strong><br>About 10 years ago my husband dug a hole in our garden to make a pond. It's still just a hole. I would love it to be a pond.</p> <p><strong>What's your biggest extravagance?</strong><br>I'm not a big spender. Over the past&#xa0;year, little things have made a big difference, like getting nice cheese and wine delivered. That kept me going. </p> <p><strong>In what place are you happiest?</strong><br>On holiday. We have a caravan. Getting away from the world to the coast or the countryside, away from the computer, away from the internet — sitting outside with the wildlife and a glass of wine. </p> <p><strong>What ambitions do you still have?</strong><br>For the past 18 months I've been learning the piano. I'd like to be able to get through some complicated pieces of music without falling over the notes. I'd love to get to that point where I can just play. </p> <p><strong>What drives you on?</strong><br>I get excited by new ideas and opportunities. If there's a problem to be solved, that drives me on. It means I say yes too easily to too many things, as anyone who works with me will tell you.</p> <p><strong>What is the greatest achievement of your life so far?</strong><br>It has to be my son. At the end of the day, people matter more than status. </p> <p><strong>What do you find most irritating in other people?</strong><br>When people are always late.</p> <p><strong>If your 20-year-old self could see you now, what would she think?</strong><br>She would be pretty amazed. I was quite shy. I was never the person to put myself forward, put myself out there. To find myself in leadership roles and enjoy them was never on the cards for me, growing up. And she might say: “Have a bit more fun, Cath!” </p> <p><strong>Which object that you've lost do you wish you still had?</strong><br>The ability to switch off — though that's not an object. Years ago, we had a lock-up garage with a car in it, an Austin Seven. The car and the garage simply disappeared. To this day, we have no idea what happened. We guess maybe the car was stolen, the garage was damaged and the council cleared the site. </p> <p><strong>What is the greatest challenge of our time?</strong><br>This week it's Covid, but I think climate change is bigger. But when you look at both of these, there's an underlying need to recognise that we have a collective responsibility for humanity and the planet. How we transition society to take that on, I don't know.</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife?</strong><br>I'm not particularly religious but I wouldn't rule it out. </p> <p><strong>If you had to rate your satisfaction with your life so far, out of 10, what would you score?</strong><br>Eight. Everything is pretty good. But I have an appalling work-life balance.</p> <p><em>Professor Noakes has received a Royal Academy of Engineering President's Special Award for Pandemic Service.
