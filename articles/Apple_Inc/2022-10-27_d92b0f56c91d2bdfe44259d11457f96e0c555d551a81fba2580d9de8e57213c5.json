  "title": "Meta Losing Streak Rattles Investors --- Facebook parent's stock plunges 20% after bell as its sales decline accelerates",
  "text": "<p>Meta shares dropped a further 20% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.</p><p>Meta is battling a host of challenges, including the tough macroeconomic climate, growing competition from rival TikTok and the fallout from Apple Inc. ad-tracking changes, all of which have taken a toll on its massive advertising business.</p><p>Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he is encouraged by the progress in responding to the tougher environment. \"I have to say that our product trends look better from what I see,\" he said on a call with analysts. \"I'm pretty confident this is going in a good direction.\"</p><p>At least some of those issues are being felt across Silicon Valley, with the YouTube unit of Alphabet Inc.-owned Google posting a decline in advertising revenue on Tuesday and Snap Inc. delivering disappointing results last week.</p><p>But Meta is also undergoing an ambitious and expensive pivot, away from its core social-media products including Facebook and Instagram, and toward a future centered on the so-called metaverse where users can live, work and play in an immersive online experience.</p><p>The company's ambitious plans to build out the metaverse are also off to a halting start.</p><p>Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is driving the company's virtual-reality and metaverse efforts, posted revenue of $285 million for the quarter, a decline of nearly 49% compared with a year ago. This was due to lower sales of its Quest 2 virtual-reality headsets, Meta Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said. The unit had an operating loss of $3.7 billion, and the company said it expects that figure will grow significantly next year.</p><p>Horizon Worlds, Meta's flagship metaverse product for consumers, has less than 200,000 monthly active users, far below the company's original goal of 500,000 users by the end of this year, according to company documents cited by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month.</p><p>The company didn't provide new Horizon user figures on Wednesday.</p><p>The company said its average ad price decreased 18% year-over-year, as it adjusts to Apple's changes that make it harder for Meta to track users and serve them personalized advertising. In the same quarter last year, the average price per ad climbed 22%.</p><p>The effects of Apple's changes diminished in the third quarter, but that was offset by weak advertising demand, Mr. Wehner said.</p><p>The company said it was also hurt by the strong dollar, and that if foreign-exchange rates had been constant, it would have posted a slight increase in revenue.</p><p>Meta posted net profit of $4.4 billion for the third quarter. That represents the fourth quarter in a row that the company's bottom line has fallen, something Meta hasn't experienced since the fourth quarter of 2012.</p><p>For the quarter, advertising came in at $27.2 billion, down nearly 4% compared with a year ago. Analysts predicted Meta's ad revenue would fall to $26.9 billion. Advertising revenue represented 98.2% of the company's total revenue.</p><p>The company said it plans to invest in head-count growth \"only in our highest priorities\" and shrink some of its teams. The company said it had more than 87,000 employees at the end of September, and expects to stay around that level.</p><p>Meta said it expects its 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85 billion to $87 billion, down from a previous forecast of between $85 billion and $88 billion. The company said it anticipates its 2023 total expenses to be between $96 billion and $101 billion.</p><p>Meta is also grappling with a digital-advertising market in upheaval from surging inflation and other factors, including the Ukraine war, which are causing a slowdown in ad spending.</p><p>\"It's a tough time to be a big social-media company right now,\" said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. \"You're facing a lot of pressures on revenue, usage and the worsening economy on top of it.\"</p><p>Before Wednesday, Meta's shares had fallen nearly 60% and it had lost more than $550 billion in market value in 2022.</p><p>In its efforts to combat TikTok, Meta has given priority to the development and growth of Reels, its short-form video format on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Meta is now seeing 140 billion Reels plays across Facebook and Instagram each day, which is a 50% increase from six months ago, Mr. Zuckerberg said.</p><p>\"The trends look good, and we believe that we're gaining time-spent share on competitors, like TikTok,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said.</p><p>Reels, however, doesn't monetize as effectively as the company's other types of content, so as the company pivots toward showing more short-form video, Meta is taking a more than $500 million quarterly revenue headwind, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Meta expects to get to a more neutral place with this shift within the next 12 to 18 months.</p><p>\"As Reels grows, we're displacing revenue from higher-monetized surfaces,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said. \"That's clearly the right thing to do.\"</p>",
