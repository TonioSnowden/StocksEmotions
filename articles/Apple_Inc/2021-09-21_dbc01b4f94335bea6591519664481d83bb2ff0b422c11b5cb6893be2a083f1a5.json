It grew to include millions of accounts, according to documents viewed by the Journal. In addition, some users are “whitelisted,” meaning they were rendered immune from enforcement actions, the documents showed.</p><p>A 2019 internal Facebook review found that the practice of whitelisting was “not publicly defensible.” The company had previously told the Oversight Board in writing that its system for high-profile users was only used in “a small number of decisions.”</p><p>In a blog post on Tuesday, the board said it was looking into whether Facebook has “been fully forthcoming in its responses in relation to cross-check, including the practice of whitelisting.”</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Real-estate agents gear up for fight to save their commissions.</p><p>iOS 15 is here: The iPhone software update's small tricks make a big difference.</p>",
