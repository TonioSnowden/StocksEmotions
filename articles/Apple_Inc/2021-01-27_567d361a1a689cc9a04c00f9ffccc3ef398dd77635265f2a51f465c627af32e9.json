  "text": "<p>From Thomas Edison to Steve Jobs, the ideas of inventors and the companies they went on to found have generated handsome profits while providing society with products and services that help people lead better lives.</p> <p>Take a device that makes housework easier. A new form of vacuum cleaner is what helped turn British inventor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/502609ad-6e89-3590-9221-beb7c031f0dc\">James Dyson</a> into a wealthy man. By 2018, the company he had set up almost 30 years earlier to manufacture it was reporting earnings of £1.1bn before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.</p> <p>Of course, what constitutes a benefit to society can be a matter of debate. Even seemingly obvious technological advances can have unforeseen side effects, and innovators run the risk of opprobrium from pressure groups, or indifference from investors.</p> <p>Consider the invention of the internal combustion engine, which, after Henry Ford pioneered assembly line production in the early 20th century, gave millions of people the benefit of unprecedented mobility.</p> <p>Today, this piece of technology is blamed for contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, with the UK proposing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e9af60b-774b-4a72-8d06-d34b5192ffb4\">ban the sale of new combustion-engine vehicles from 2030</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps even more controversial is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e6de356-2f57-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a\">genetic modification</a>, which has fuelled the growth of multi-billion-dollar companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/21110ae9-43f3-4127-8543-8081db1d830e\">Monsanto</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/291fc4f4-e26d-4293-988f-36b092c86d97\">Syngenta</a>. While some see the technology as enabling the increased crop yields needed to feed a hungry world, activists blame it for everything from soil erosion to the impoverishment of farmers.</p> <h2>Acceptable returns?</h2> <p>Not all food innovations are as controversial, however. Many promise healthy people, a healthy planet and healthy financial returns. In fact, agri-food technology — often enabling more sustainable food production — attracted almost $20bn in venture capital in 2019, according to AgFunder, a venture capital firm.</p> <p>One of the most prominent among the companies in this industry is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/ad5223da-184d-4767-9905-94ef0e6e4653\">Beyond Meat</a>, whose plant-based meat substitute could help combat the harmful climatic effects of livestock farming, which produces significant amounts of greenhouse gas. When it listed on the Nasdaq in 2020, the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afe0e4e6-6c5b-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d\">raised $241m</a>.</p> <p>Even so, some wonder just how much money should be made from inventions that benefit society. The question has arisen most recently since the development of vaccines to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The companies behind them have taken <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/405c0d07-d15a-4f5b-8a77-3c2fbd5d4c1c\">different approaches</a>. While <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cf071a2-b6a6-49ac-b921-f3ecd30267b2\">Moderna</a> is selling its vaccine at about $30 a dose, and Pfizer/BioNTech at about $19, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84b53ae7-fa05-4914-b7e5-8a2c5908d2f4\">Oxford/AstraZeneca</a> has said it will sell its vaccine at cost price (about $3-4 a dose) for the duration of the pandemic, and in perpetuity in the case of low-income countries.</p> <p>Steven Desmyter, co-head of responsible investing at hedge fund Man Group, believes this will eventually benefit Oxford/AstraZeneca, since it could win favour among the growing number of ESG investors, who want their money to have a positive impact on the environment, society and governance.</p> <p>“So while the mRNA vaccine producers [such as Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna] may have had a brief spell in the sun following their stellar efficacy reads, I still think that AstraZeneca may be the long-term winner of the vaccine race,” Mr Desmyter wrote in the Financial Times in December.</p> <h2>Everyone's a winner</h2> <p>Dutch nutrition group DSM also believes it is possible to turn a profit while developing technologies that benefit the world's poorest communities. It has joined the Rwandan government, the UN World Food Programme and other international development organisations in creating <a href=\"https://africaimprovedfoods.com/\">Africa Improved Foods</a>, a company that is tackling malnutrition (profits will be used to underwrite the costs of feeding programmes).</p> <p>DSM developed a range of porridge flours that are easily digestible by children and enriched with the vitamins, minerals and proteins they need for healthy growth. And while it is AIF that will generate revenues from the flour products, DSM also benefits.</p> <p>“Nutrition is part of our business, so if this grows the buy for nutrition, and if we are getting our share of that buy, our business will grow as well,” says Fokko Wientjes, who leads DSM's sustainability nutrition partnerships and programmes. “And it has a huge impact on employee engagement and in being an employer of choice.”</p> <p>Many see opportunities of this sort in innovations that help meet the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. According to the Business and Sustainable Development Commission — a multilateral initiative established in 2016 to make a business case for the SDGs — efforts to achieve the SDGs could create $12tn in market opportunities.</p> <p>“We often talk about the SDGs as a statement of what the world needs by 2030 — and where there's needs, there's business opportunity,” says Mark Lancelott, a sustainability expert at PA Consulting.</p> <p>He argues that talk of trade-offs between helping society and turning a profit reflects outdated thinking. “If you can change your mindset and think about how to use disruptive technologies and new business models, there's ways of driving growth . . . that can contribute to the SDGs and have a positive impact in the world,” he says.</p><p>Source: Sarah Murray 2021 'Invention is the mother of profitability' FT.com 27 January.
