  "text": "<p>(HBO Max)</p><p>There has been a lot of full-frontal male nudity going around on TV and film lately, but the only male nudity Ellen Rapoport wanted showing up in \"Minx\" is workplace nudity. This is easier for \"Minx\" than most because the comedy is set in the 1970s world of soft-core magazine pornography.</p><p>Joyce Prigger (Ophelia Lovibond) dreams of starting a feminist magazine called The Matriarchy Awakens that will bring her a Pulitzer and friendship with Gloria Steinem. Then she meets Doug Renetti (Jake Johnson), the publisher of a growing empire of pornographic magazine titles who encourages her to \"hide the medicine\" that is her message under the cover of naked male bodies. The result is Minx, a magazine for women that includes the kinds of pictures Renetti knows how to sell with the articles Prigger wants to write.</p><p>Ms. Rapoport says she wanted the male nudity in her show to be more deliberate than salacious. The cover model on Minx's debut issue, for example, is seen in the nude during the photo shoot and in the shower at his day job (he is a firefighter), but not when he goes to bed with Prigger, the magazine's editor.</p><p>\"To us, it was like: If there would be nudity in the workplace, that's when we would put it in,\" Ms. Rapoport says. \"We didn't just randomly shove in nudity because we could.\"</p><p>The final two episodes of the first season of \"Minx\" begin streaming April 14 on HBO Max.</p><p>'Harry Wild'</p><p>(Acorn TV)</p><p>\"Harry Wild\" is a lot like \"Murder, She Wrote,\" if Jessica Fletcher showed more of an interest in sex and wine.</p><p>While Angela Lansbury played a teacher-turned-murder-solving author happy to sip tea and chat with her old friend Seth at the end of a long day, Jane Seymour's Harry Wild is a newly retired literature professor who likes to unwind with a bottle of red and a roll in the hay. Much to the chagrin of her son, a local police detective, she begins leveraging her literature chops to help solve murder mysteries around Dublin. For help, she isn't afraid to enlist her teenage granddaughter (Rose O'Neill). And she turns a teenage boy who tried to rob her (Rohan Nedd) into her assistant.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Harry took her knowledge of teaching and is teaching this young boy about life and her granddaughter about life and about literature and sleuthing at the same time,\" Ms. Seymour says in an interview. \"So she's actually using all her skills, but she's used them in a different environment.\"</p><p>Ms. Seymour says she has kept costumes from the movies and TV shows she has appeared in, from \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\" to \"Wedding Crashers.\" She pulls from her collection when she reports for duty in a new role. She says she showed up to shoot \"Harry Wild\" with three suitcases worth of options.</p><p>\"I wanted Harry to be an intellectual, but at the same time, she's a woman and she's not afraid to look good,\" she says. \"If she's going to the university to cause trouble, she'll put on an evening gown and wow it up a bit.\"</p><p>The first two episodes of \"Harry Wild\" are streaming now on Acorn TV.</p><p>Major League Baseball</p><p>(Various)</p><p>Every season, each sport streams a little differently, a little more often and in a few more places. Now that the baseball owners and players have a deal to play ball this season after an offseason lockout, here's a look at a few of the places you can stream Major League Baseball games once things gets started on Thursday:</p><p>Apple TV+ is streaming a \"Friday Night Baseball\" double-header this season. The initial games are available free to stream on Apple TV+, even if you don't subscribe to the service. Games start Friday with the New York Mets versus the Washington Nationals at 7 p.m. ET, followed by the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels at 9:30 p.m. ET.</p><p>ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcasts are streaming on the ESPN app. Sunday's game is between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox at 7 p.m. ET.</p><p>SiriusXM satellite radio is carrying every game from every team. Subscribers of TuneIn's premium tier can stream the audio of every game, too. Fans outside their favorite team's home TV market can still subscribe to watch their games at MLB.TV.</p><p>Keep an eye on Peacock. Not all of the streaming deals are completed and The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the streamer was completing a deal with MLB to stream 18 games starting as early as 11:30 a.m. ET on Sundays.</p><p>Note: Different teams have different streaming and broadcast opportunities. Check with your home team for all available ways to stream their 2022 games.</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>—\"Tokyo Vice,\" starring Ansel Elgort and Ken Watanabe, is loosely based on an American journalist's time covering the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. The series drops its first three episodes Thursday on HBO Max, with executive producer Michael Mann directing the first episode.</p><p>—\"Metal Lords,\" a new film about high-schoolers who start a metal band to compete in a battle of the bands competition, was written by D.B. Weiss and executive produced by his \"Game of Thrones\" co-creator, David Benioff. The movie begins streaming Friday on Netflix.</p><p>What to Watch: 'Minx,' Major League Baseball and Three More Things to Stream This Weekend</p>",
