  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Lab Director Raised Alarm About Theranos Tests  ----  By Heather Somerville",
  "text": "<p>   Theranos Inc.'s former lab director testified Friday about what he called pervasive and persistent errors in the company's blood-testing technology and his efforts to stop the startup from using its machines on real patients. </p><p>   Adam Rosendorff, who served as lab director for the now-defunct blood-testing company from 2013 to 2014, said that he alerted founder and Chief Executive Officer Elizabeth Holmes to the problems with the tests but that his warnings were ignored. </p><p>   \"I came to believe the company cared more about PR and fundraising than patient care,\" said Dr. Rosendorff. </p><p>   His comments capped the third week of witness testimony in the criminal fraud trial of Ms. Holmes. He is the fourth former employee to take the witness stand as federal prosecutors build their case against Ms. Holmes, who is alleged to have defrauded patients and investors with claims that her blood-testing device could diagnose more than 200 health conditions using a few drops of blood from a finger prick. </p><p>   Dr. Rosendorff testified that Ms. Holmes was aware the company's devices produced inaccurate results but pushed for Theranos to begin testing real patients. He said he left about a year and a half after joining after determining patient care wasn't the company's priority. </p><p>   Ms. Holmes has pleaded not guilty to a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. </p><p>   Upon taking the job, Dr. Rosendorff was inspired by what he called Ms. Holmes's earnest dedication to improve patient care. He said that while he didn't know much about the technology Theranos was building, he believed it would be innovative. </p><p>   \"I thought it was going to be the next Apple,\" he said. </p><p>   Dr. Rosendorff said his impressions changed soon after joining the startup. On Aug. 29, 2013, a little over a week before Theranos was set to launch its devices for testing patients' blood, Dr. Rosendorff sent an email to Ms. Holmes detailing how even simple tests were returning results that were way off, according to a copy of an email that was displayed in court. </p><p>   He said he asked for more time to address the issues and to hire more staff and improve training. He also visited Ms. Holmes's office, where she had a paper posted to the window noting the number of days until the commercial launch. </p><p>   \"She was very nervous,\" said Dr. Rosendorff. \"She was not her usual composed self.\" He described Ms. Holmes as trembling and her voice breaking. </p><p>   In an email shown in court and dated Aug. 31, 2013, Ms. Holmes asked members of her staff how many tests had completed validation, a process required by federal regulatory guidelines before a test can be used for patient care. A staff scientist responded that none of the tests had completed validation. It was about nine days before Theranos was supposed to launch its devices for use on real patients, said Dr. Rosendorff. </p><p>   Dr. Rosendorff reported to Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, the second-in-command and Ms. Holmes's ex-boyfriend. Dr. Rosendorff said Mr. Balwani often rebuffed his concerns or responded with hostility, so the lab director at times brought his concerns directly to Ms. Holmes because, as CEO, he thought she would be empowered to fix the problems. That didn't happen, he said. </p><p>   Theranos's tests continued to provide inaccurate and at times highly implausible results. </p><p>   Dr. Rosendorff gave examples of tests for sodium and HDL, a cholesterol measurement, that were so far below the normal range for healthy individuals that he believed they were erroneous. </p><p></p>",
