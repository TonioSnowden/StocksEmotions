  "title": "Morrison in talks with Takeover Panel over competing offers",
  "text": "<p><strong>Wm Morrison</strong> has called on the Takeover Panel to break the deadlock between the US private equity funds jostling to buy the supermarket. </p> <p>Morrison is in talks with the Panel to launch a formal auction process, having last month agreed a £7bn offer from Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. A rival consortium led by SoftBank-owned Fortress Investment Group could still trump CD&amp;R's bid, with neither firm having declared their offers final.</p> <p>The auction is likely to take place prior to shareholder meetings scheduled for the week of October 18. Shareholders will receive further details of the CD&amp;R offer later this month to provide “sufficient time” to resolve the situation, Morrison said.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Engineer <strong>Smiths Group</strong> has agreed to sell its medial division to ICU Medical for $2.4bn after the US-based group outbid private equity firm TA Associates. Smiths said it had withdrawn its recommendation of the bid from TA, which had last month agreed a $2bn deal. ICU's superior offer involves initial cash proceeds of $1.85bn and equity worth $500m based on Tuesday's closing price, Smiths said. It expects the sale to close in the first half of 2022.</p> <p>Online gambling company <strong>888</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d567ec7-b466-4ddf-ab68-ef6943d63bd5\">confirmed it is in talks</a> to buy the betting shops and European business of William Hill, the UK bookmaker that was taken private in a £2.9bn deal last year. London-listed 888 said it was in “advanced discussions” with Caesars Entertainment, William Hill's new owner.</p> <p><strong>Halfords</strong> said trading in recent months has remained strong, with sales in the 20-week period to mid August up 18.7 per cent versus the equivalent pre-pandemic period. The bike and auto parts retailer said that in spite of a challenging operating environment it continued to target a full-year pre-tax profit of at least £75m. </p> <p>Martin Sorrell's <strong>S4 Capital</strong> said its Media Monks division will merge with Cashmere, a US-based culture and creative marketing agency. Terms of the deal were not provided.</p> <p><strong>Bakkavor</strong> left full-year guidance unchanged after cost savings helped deliver a 63.8 per cent surge in half-year underlying earnings. The ready meal and convenience foodmaker reported an adjusted operating profit of £47m on revenue up 4 per cent to £915.7m. “Despite unprecedented challenges in labour availability and its impact on the supply chain, as well as&#xa0;raw material inflation, the group expects to deliver full-year operating profit margin in line with the first half,” it said.</p> <p><strong>Biffa</strong>, the waste disposal group, said trading in the first half ending September has continued in line with the board's expectations. </p> <p>Retailer <strong>Dunelm</strong> said recent sales growth has been encouraging and better than anticipated. In the absence of any further trading restrictions, 2022 pre-tax profit will be modestly ahead of analysts' expectations, it said. For the full year ended June, Dunelm reported a £157.8m pre-tax profit on sales of £1.3bn, up 44.6 per cent and 26.3 per cent respectively. Having not paid a 2020 dividend the company declared a one-off payment of 65p per share in addition to its 35p full-year ordinary dividend. </p> <p><strong>Avon Protection</strong> said it had secured a contract worth up to $87.6m to develop and supply a helmet for the US Army. The new contract replaces one announced in September 2020 which was withdrawn following a competitor protest.</p> <p>Video games maker <strong>Frontier Developments</strong> said it was on track to release flagship title <em>Jurassic World Evolution 2 </em>in November to catch holiday season sales. For the full year ended May Frontier posted operating profit up 20 per cent to £19.9m on revenue up 19 per cent to £90.7m.</p> <p><strong>Winkworth</strong>, the London-focused estate agent, said first half pre-tax profit jumped 330 per cent to £2m as revenues more than doubled to £5.3m. Sales applicants continue to track well ahead of 2019 levels and the rental market has seen a significant upturn in activity, it said.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>El Salvador's pioneering adoption of <strong>bitcoin</strong> as legal tender&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56f1f053-3ac1-424a-97d6-6bbf9a12fa1d\">hit snags</a> within hours&#xa0;of the launch after the government had to take its app for storing the volatile digital asset temporarily offline and the global price slumped.&#xa0;</p> <p>Doug Field, an executive with responsibility for <strong>Apple</strong>'s secretive car project, has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45dc9e63-733a-430b-9e3f-926294f93901\">left for Ford</a>&#xa0;in an exit that potentially spells the end of the iPhone maker's automotive ambitions.</p> <p><strong>PayPal</strong>, the US online payments company, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdeccd3c-fe41-4228-ad11-9efc6f5c9d2d\">agreed to acquire Paidy</a>, a Tokyo-based “buy now, pay later” group, for ¥300bn ($2.7bn).</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>The UK's target to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ff0ab09-13b8-4ba3-9ad8-8cdf6607a64d#comments-anchor\">raise £12bn a year</a>&#xa0;for NHS funding plays on the misplaced idea among voters that national insurance exclusively funds “good” spending on healthcare. National insurance, though, is a tax on activity which could fall hardest on those labour-intensive sectors worst hit by the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Peggy Hollinger</strong> <br>Germany and France have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6a9b42d-bde5-4279-972f-16509daa4a89\">stepped up support</a> for their aerospace manufacturing industries with hydrogen and hybrid electric flight as priorities. But while Britain has provided £8.5bn to the sector through its general loan scheme and export finance, there was no obvious industrial plan guiding how the money was allocated.&#xa0;And without a long-term strategy, there is a very real risk that British aerospace falls even further behind. </p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Morrison in talks with Takeover Panel over competing offers' FT.com 8 September.
