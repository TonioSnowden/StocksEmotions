Apple reported $7.25 billion in iPad revenue, lower than the $8.44 billion it posted a year earlier and the consensus analyst estimate of $8.19 billion.</p><p>See also: PC boom is still going strong, helped by corporate sales</p><p>Apple generated $14.7 billion in revenue from its wearables, home and accessories category, up from $12.97 billion a year before.

Apple's earnings call will hold more details about how the consumer-electronics giant has fared with its supply-chain issues, but analysts seem cautiously upbeat about how conditions are progressing.</p><p>Don't miss: Apple stock is a ‘place to hide' amid volatile markets, says analyst</p><p>“Sentiment has shifted a bit more positive as the supply chain appears to have improved at a faster pace,” Barcalys analyst Tim Long wrote ahead of the report.</p><p>Long added that he was “not sure what guidance we will get” for the March quarter but anticipated that Apple could indicate iPhone expectations above normal seasonal levels, due to supply-chain improvements and some “product push-out” during the holiday quarter.</p><p>Shares of Apple have risen 6.6% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has declined 3.6%.</p>",
