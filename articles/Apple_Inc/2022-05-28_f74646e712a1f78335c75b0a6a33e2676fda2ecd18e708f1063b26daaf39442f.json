  "text": "<p>\n  VMWARE INC. </p><p>\n  VMW +3.2% </p><p>\n  A giant chip maker wants to become a powerhouse in the world of corporate software. Broadcom Inc. plans to buy software firm VMware for $61 billion in cash and stock, the companies announced Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported on talks earlier in the week. The pact would push Broadcom deeper into an arena occupied by International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. It would nearly triple the size of Broadcom's software division and account for nearly 49% of the company's revenue. VMware shares added 3.2% Thursday after jumping 25% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  ABBOTT LABORATORIES </p><p>\n  ABT +1.6% </p><p>\n  A major producer of baby formula apologized for the fact that baby formula is now hard to find. In a Washington Post op-ed published May 21, Abbott Chief Executive Robert Ford said \"we're sorry to every family we've let down\" and promised production will ramp up again in June. The shortfall worsened after Abbott recalled some products and closed a Michigan plant due to reports of bacterial contamination. President Biden on May 18 invoked the Defense Production Act to increase production and launched a program to bring in supplies from overseas. Abbott shares gained 1.6% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  SNAP INC. </p><p>\n  SNAP -43% </p><p>\n  Snap spooked tech investors with a warning Monday. The maker of Snapchat said its second-quarter revenue and adjusted pretax earnings will be lower than it expected, as the social-media company feels the sting of disruptions in the digital ad market. Worries of slowdowns in online advertising rippled to other tech stocks, weighing on shares of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. Snap shares plunged 43% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS INC. </p><p>\n  ZM +5.6% </p><p>\n  Zoom wants to make new connections. Chief Executive Eric Yuan said Zoom is pivoting to some products that promote hybrid-work setups as more workers are splitting time between in-person and remote work. Companies have looked to return to physical workspaces two years into the pandemic but face obstacles such as backlash from unions and rising Covid cases. The videoconferencing company on Monday raised its profit outlook while reporting its slowest growth rate on record as demand wanes and employees are called back to offices. Zoom shares rose 5.6% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  LYFT INC. </p><p>\n  LYFT -0.4% </p><p>\n  Lyft is putting the brakes on spending. The rideshare company will slow hiring and reduce some departments' budgets to make up for its eroding share price, President John Zimmer said in a staff memo Tuesday. Lyft joins rival Uber Technologies Inc. in outlining cuts as investor optimism cools on tech stocks. The companies also face a year-long driver shortage that pushed fares to record highs. Higher prices helped boost both companies' revenue, but also contributed to riders taking fewer trips compared with prepandemic levels. Lyft shares lost 0.4% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  APPLE INC. </p><p>\n  AAPL +2.3% </p><p>\n  Apple's fight to keep talent will take a larger slice of its spending. The iPhone maker is boosting pay for workers amid rising inflation and a tight labor market. The company on Wednesday told employees in an email that the company is increasing its overall compensation budget. Starting pay for hourly workers in the U.S. will rise to at least $22 an hour, a 45% increase from 2018, and starting salaries are also expected to increase. Apple's plans follow similar moves by companies fighting to keep talent, including Microsoft Corp. Apple shares added 2.3% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  MACY'S INC. </p><p>\n  M +19% </p><p>\n  The Macy's shopper is showing some resilience. The retailer reported strong sales and raised its profit outlook, bucking the trend of lower spending reported by Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. Macy's said its customers spent more on clothing for work and special occasions, and that middle- and higher-income shoppers have been less affected by inflation compared with lower-income consumers. But it is unclear how long the trend will last, as Macy's finance chief said he expects inflation to outpace wage growth. Macy's shares surged 19% Thursday. </p><p></p>",
