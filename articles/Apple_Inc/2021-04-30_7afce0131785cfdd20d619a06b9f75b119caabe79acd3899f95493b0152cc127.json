  "title": "Banking & Finance: Capital-Gains Tax Plan Spurs Concerns --- Biden proposal would end a rule that was cornerstone of estate planning for the wealthy",
  "text": "<p>Today, people who own assets that boomed in value -- Apple Inc. stock, the family beach house, a three-generation manufacturing company -- don't pay capital-gains taxes unless they sell. Under the Biden proposal, those unrealized gains would trigger taxes upon the owner's death, minus a $1 million per-person exemption.</p><p>More than two-thirds of all U.S. families have some unrealized capital gains, according to the Federal Reserve, but most would be covered by the $1 million exemption. For families in the top 10%, with a median net worth of $2.6 million, median unrealized gains are $519,000.</p><p>The plan likely will change as it moves through Congress, and some Senate Democrats are already balking. Rep. Cindy Axne (D., Iowa) is concerned about the impact on family-owned farms and is working with other lawmakers from rural areas to seek an exemption for them. Republicans say tax increases would kill jobs and slow the economic recovery.</p><p>Meanwhile, wealthy people and their advisers are rethinking strategies and investments. Financial adviser Ken Van Leeuwen said he received more fearful calls from clients about the tax-law changes in the past week than ever. Mr. Van Leeuwen's Princeton, N.J., firm caters to people with net worth between $5 million and $25 million. Many are concerned their children will pay taxes on inherited second homes.</p><p>The Biden proposal would blow up several longstanding tax concepts: That capital gains deserve a lower tax rate than wages and that people can inherit old assets without paying capital-gains taxes. Democrats and their allies say those features of the tax system are unfairly tilted to the very wealthy.</p><p>\"It's one of the biggest, most inefficient and hardest-to-justify tax breaks that exists in the code,\" said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center. \"There's just a tiny, tiny sliver of people that have that kind of gain. It's just so unusual.\"</p><p>Under the current system, the top capital-gains tax rate is 23.8%, compared with 40.8% on wages, with state taxes on top of both. Congress created the lower rate as an incentive to invest and a way to prevent the tax code from discouraging asset sales. It is a rough adjustment for inflation and a way to limit taxes on income taxed at the corporate level.</p><p>Heirs have to pay such taxes only when they sell and only on the gain since the prior owner's death. The provision is known as the tax-free step-up in basis and has been part of the tax code since the Revenue Act of 1921. It saves taxpayers more than $40 billion a year, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation; the Biden proposal would take back some of that.</p><p>The step-up in basis is separate from the estate tax, which is based on net worth at death, not just appreciated gains. It has an $11.7 million per-person exemption. Opponents of Mr. Biden's plan warn of steep combined rates on people hit by both taxes.</p><p>The problem, Democrats say, is that significant amounts of income escape the income tax entirely, because people can buy assets, borrow against them for living expenses and die without paying income taxes on the gain. For very wealthy investors or billionaire founders of companies who take small salaries as their stock grows, it can make the income tax effectively optional.</p><p>\"If you're elderly and own highly appreciated assets, God forbid you should sell them while you're alive,\" said Lawrence Zelenak, a Duke University law professor.</p><p>Under the Biden plan, except for charitable bequests, death is treated like a sale, with a $1 million per-person exemption. That would be a lifetime exemption on bequests of gifts, and it would be portable between spouses for a total of $2 million. He would keep existing exclusions for gain on a principal residence of $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for married couples.</p><p>Now, someone who paid $2 million for a business and dies when it is worth $12 million would pay no capital-gains taxes. And if that is his only asset, he would owe no estate taxes. Under the Biden plan, he would pay taxes on $9 million -- the $10 million gain minus the $1 million exemption -- with a top marginal tax rate of 43.4%. Assets held in retirement accounts generally aren't affected.</p><p>The capital-gains rate change and taxation at death work together. Without the change to the basis rules, the 43.4% tax rate would lose money for the government because it would encourage people to hold assets that they would otherwise sell.</p><p>Taxes on the appreciation of certain family businesses would be due only upon sale or when they are no longer family-owned and operated. Mr. Biden would also allow a 15-year fixed-rate payment plan for the taxes tied to some other illiquid assets.</p><p>Manufacturers and farmers, who tend to be more asset-rich and cash-poor, are watching closely for those details, concerned they might have to sell illiquid businesses to pay the taxes.</p><p>Courtney Silver, president of Ketchie Inc., a family-owned, 25-employee machine shop in Concord, N.C., that started in 1947, said she was concerned about the potential impact.</p><p>\"I really can't imagine being hit with that decision of that potential tax implication,\" said Ms. Silver, 40 years old, who took over the business when her husband, Bobby Ketchie, died in 2014. \"That to me is really hard to wrap my head around.\"</p><p>It could be challenging for asset owners to figure out their tax basis, which is what they paid for the property and invested in it. That complexity is part of what doomed a similar proposal in the late 1970s, which Congress passed, then delayed, then repealed.</p><p>Wealthy Americans with over $100 million in assets are already turning to a range of techniques to minimize the hit from steeper taxes on their wealth, and many have already shifted further into tax-advantaged assets, said Mike Kosnitzky, co-head of the private wealth practice at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP.</p>",
