  "text": "<p>The elegant sci-fi <em>Swan Song</em> might almost be a period piece, so old-school is its vision of the future. In place of a parched dystopia, director Benjamin Cleary dials forward a couple of decades to find sleek surfaces and minimalist furniture. The hero, Cameron (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66d90431-4691-4173-8e45-6ffdc48b837f\">Mahershala Ali</a>), is a graphic designer, as befits a world now apparently run by them. Contact lenses remove themselves; spotless public transport is staffed by robot waiters who know how you like your oat milk latte; advances in biotechnology allow human cloning to be discreetly practised.<br><br>But first the film gives us a lovely, timeless opening as Cameron's commute is lit up by a chance encounter with Poppy (Naomie Harris), neither able to suppress a smile at the mere sight of the other. The meet-cute diffuses through the rest of the story. Flashing forward, there is marriage, kids, a reminder of the fragility of happiness. Even in this chic future, the flesh is weak. Cameron is diagnosed with a terminal illness; he seeks to have himself replaced by a “regeneration”, his duplicate meant to take his place without Poppy even realising.</p> <p>The understated lab is set in woods that suggest both a fairytale and the presence over a nearby fence of Oscar Isaac's pile from <em>Ex Machina</em>. A dislike of clutter also seems to define Cameron's illness, non-specific and, while assuredly fatal, free of almost any symptoms. Such details would presumably get in the way of the spiritual teasers offered by the premise: what is left unique to us once someone else has both our body and our memories? Do we owe our loved ones the truth above all?<br><br>To these grand questions, the film offers a meditative <em>hmmm</em>. In a movie about what it means to be human, Ali is very nearly the best thing in it, poignant and real. The actual best thing is Harris, still waiting for the starring role her talent deserves.</p> <p>★★★☆☆<br><br><em>In UK and US cinemas and on Apple TV Plus from December 17</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris star in elegant sci-fi Swan Song' FT.com 16 December.
