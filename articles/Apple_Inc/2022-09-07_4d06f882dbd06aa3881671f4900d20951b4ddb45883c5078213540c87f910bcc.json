Stock-market investors took the comments in stride, with major indexes ticking up to new session highs following Brainard's remarks.</p><p>Stocks shook off a premarket wobble seen after a reportpublished by The Wall Street Journal said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's commitment to reducing inflation even if it increases unemployment appeared to put the central bank on track to hike interest rates by 0.75 percentage point, rather than half of a percentage point, when policy makers meet later this month.</p><p>Traders had already largely priced in a 75 basis point move. Fed-funds futures traders priced in an 76% chance of a 75 basis point move following the report, up from 73% on Tuesday, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</p><p>\"I still think they do 75 basis points, just because the market is largely price smart –they take it and they see what happens. But to me at least, inflation is set to roll over and possibly pretty hard,\" said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. \"My worry is that the Federal Reserve thinks they have to keep hiking longer than what they really need to, because I do think it is starting to wear off.\"</p><p>The Fed's Beige Book survey showed the U.S. grew slightly through end the August, but the outlook for the economy over the next year \"remained generally weak\" because of rising interest rates and nagging labor and supply shortages. The report is published eight times each year before the Federal Open Market Committee meetings and helps the Fed make key decisions about the economy.</p><p>According to the report, \"substantial price increases were reported across all Districts, particularly for food, rent, utilities, and hospitality services.\" Meanwhile, employment rose at a modest to moderate pace in most districts. \"Overall labor market conditions remained tight, although nearly all Districts highlighted some improvement in labor availability.\"</p><p>See: Why the stock market's June lows 'need to be back in the conversation,' according to one technical analyst</p><p>Stocks have retreated well off their mid-August highs as a summer bounce was brought to an end as Federal Reserve officials signaled they were unlikely to pivot away from higher interest rates in 2023.</p><p>\"Today's bounce, in isolation might seem strange,\" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments. But context also matters, he said, particularly with the market's sharp reversal in the past two weeks as more investors abandoned the idea of the Fed backing off its inflation fight.</p><p>\"I don't necessarily think that this is the markets looking through or doubting the Federal Reserve's conviction,\" he said, in an interview.</p><p>A sharp surge in Treasury yields pressured stocks on Tuesday. The benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 15 basis points, the largest one-day climb in a month.

Christopher Waller is due to speak on Friday.</p><p>The Bank of Canada lifted its overnight target rate by three-quarter percentage points to 3.25%, following a surprise increase of a full percentage point in July.
