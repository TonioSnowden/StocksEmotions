  "title": "The recent whipsaw for stocks means the bear market is still with us, says this strategist; Critical information for the U.S. trading day",
  "text": "<p>And so, the downtrend begun at the start of the year remains intact. Optimists hoping the S&amp;P 500's SPX month-long bounce off its mid-June trough signaled the start of a sustained bull run have been confounded.</p><p>Indeed, Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI's chief equity and quantitative strategist, says that past experience tells us the recent volatility does not portend well.</p><p>\"While a bear market defined as -20% holds true, the idea that a rally of 20% or more from the low ends the bear proved costly in 2007-09 and 2000-02,\" Emanuel says in a note to clients.</p><p>In particular, he argues, observers were over eager in their hope that because the recent August S&amp;P 500 high of 4,325 represented a greater than 50% retracement rally from the June low of 3,637 to January's peak of 4,819, it marked the end of a bear market.</p><p>It is not always the case. Partly because 2022 has been especially volatile. Not only did the 50% retracement rally occur, but a 50% decline from the August peak to halfway (3,981) to the June low then happened within days, notes Emanuel.</p><p>\"Such a 50/50 whipsaw has happened only 4 other times since 1950 and confirms that the prevailing bear market has not ended,\" he states.</p><p>The potentially better news is that while such whipsaw action favors further downside risks for the S&amp;P 500, fresh bear market lows only occurred half the time, in 2008-09 and in 1998. Meanwhile, in 2011 and 1991 stocks made a higher low.</p><p>\"Could this past week be forging a higher low? Possibly, but investing should not be a 50/50 proposition…Given the wild swings and traditional September volatility, we would label a new bull market as beginning above the 4,325.28 August high,\" Emanuel adds.</p><p>In the meantime the Evercore team suggests focusing on stocks with strong free cash flow, which have already suffered forecast earnings compression such as Meta META, Bank of America BAC, Comcast CMCSA, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Charter Communications CHTR.</p><p>The markets</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose less than 0.1% to 3912 as the 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y dipped 3.5 basis points to 3.314%. U.S. crude oil CL.1 was up 0.9% to $87.63 a barrel. Gold GC00 added 0.3% to $1,717 an ounce and Bitcoin BTCUSD slid 0.9% to $18,796.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>There is some Fed chatter and data on the cards for Wednesday. Cleveland Fed president Loretta Messer will be making comments at 10 a.m. Eastern and Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard speaks at 12:35 p.m. Finally, the Fed Beige Book of anecdotal information on economic conditions will be published at 2 p.m. Also, U.S. trade data for July are due for release at 8:30 a.m.</p><p>Apple AAPL is expected to reveal its new iPhone family, among other announcements, at an event on Wednesday starting at 1 p.m. Eastern</p><p>The U.S. dollar DXY continues to rampage across currency markets as market risk aversion and expectations for a relatively more aggressive Fed take their toll. The euro EURUSD remains below parity, the U.K. pound GBPUSD sits near a 37-year low and it takes more than 144 Japanese yen USDJPY to buy one buck, the most this century.</p><p>And the Chinese yuan USDCNY is flirting with 7 to the dollar, a two-year low, after data showed export growth for the world's second biggest economy slowed to 7.1% for the year to August, down from 18% in July. Analysts had forecast an increase of 12.5%.</p><p>Elon Musk continues to try and wriggle out of his agreement to buy Twitter. According to a report from the Financial Times, texts between the billionaire founder of Tesla TSLA and his bankers show Musk suggested delaying the $44 billion purchase because after Russia invaded Ukraine it \"wouldn't make sense to buy Twitter if we're heading into world war three\".</p><p>Shares in NIO NIO, the China-based electric vehicle maker, fell about 5% in pre-market action after it reported a bigger than expected lossand delivered a downbeat outlook.</p><p>Best of the web</p><p>Europe can – and must – win the energy war Inside the mission to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant Millennials and Gen Z explain reluctance to have children</p><p>The chart</p><p>Yep, that's just what we need right now: even more expensive coffee! Rabobank this week lowered its forecast for global coffee output for the looming 2022/23 season to 169 million 60 kilogram bags from 172.3 million previously. It sees a supply/demand deficit of 1.3 million bags, primarily in Arabica. Some producers are struggling with poor weather, while Honduras, for example, saw coffee exports drop 29% for the year to August because of a fungus know as leaf rust.</p><p>The ICE Arabica coffee future front contract KC00 sits at $2.30 per lb, below the 11-year high of $2.60 touched in February but more than $1 over the rough average over the past several years. Speculative positioning is increasingly net long, meaning many in the market reckon the price will go higher still.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>Here were the most active stock-market tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m. Eastern. </p><p> Ticker   Security name  TSLA     Tesla  GME      GameStop  BBBY     Bed Bath &amp; Beyond  AMC      AMC Entertainment  NIO      NIO  APE      AMC Entertainment preferred  AAPL     Apple  TWTR     Twitter  NVDA     Nvidia  AMZN     Amazon.com</p><p>Random reads</p><p>Life lessons of a 67 year old life guard Golden Girls unite Congress Thomas the Tank Engine introduces autistic character The Super-smeller who can spot Parkinsons</p><p>Need to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
