  "title": "Meta Delivers for Its Advertisers --- Reach and mechanics get results even as controversy surrounds social-media company's algorithms",
  "text": "<p>Wall Street forecasts total advertising revenue for the company formerly called Facebook will reach more than $114 billion this year, or about 17% of the entire global ad market. That is 10 times the amount projected for social-media competitors Twitter, Snap and Pinterest combined. Last year, the ad revenue Meta generated in the U.S. and Canada was more than two-thirds of the total spent on U.S. television ads and nearly five times the ad revenue for the U.S. newspaper industry.</p><p>Controversial or not, Meta's family of apps and its 3.5 billion monthly users are too big to ignore. Case in point? Last year, Facebook faced a massive advertiser boycott over concerns about hate speech on the platform. Since then, Meta's platforms have collectively added roughly one million advertisers. Meta now says it has more than 10 million advertisers even as its rivals haven't dared to give recent comparisons.</p><p>Meta's edge in advertising comes from more than just reach. The very mechanics that make its platforms addictive for consumers also hook advertisers, who value a high return on their investments. Much like other social-media platforms, each time there is an opportunity for a user to view an ad an auction takes place on Meta's platforms to determine which ad to show. Auction winners are determined by two factors: bid and relevance.</p><p>Meta says its auctions are unique in that they give greater weight to an ad's relevance. Ultimately, Meta subsidizes relevant ads in its auctions, meaning the most relevant ads might cost less to advertisers, even if they see more results. At the end of the day, the ads that are the most relevant keep the most people engaged.</p><p>The sheer number of advertisers Meta boasts means billions of auctions are taking place every day across the company's family of apps. Think of Instagram's ad platform, for example, as an elite sports tournament: Its ads might seem \"better\" than those on other companies' platforms because, by the time you see them, they have rigorously competed for the prize of appealing precisely to you.</p><p>For advertisers, the proof is in the pudding. In the second quarter, Meta said it generated on average more than $51 per monthly user in the U.S. and Canada. All social-media companies report returns on users a bit differently, but Meta's stand out pretty much any way you slice them. Pinterest said its average revenue per monthly active user in the U.S. was just over $5 over the same period, while Snap said it generated just over $7 per daily active user in North America. And Meta is improving: In the third quarter, the company said its average advertising return per user in the U.S. and Canada was up more than 85% from the same period three years earlier.</p><p>There are other reasons why Meta's ads might be driving empirically superior returns. While traditional advertising was about spreading the word on your brand, today's ad game is about conversion. Social-media companies increasingly are turning to direct-response ads -- those meant to get you to buy, subscribe or download something right now. Meta has said direct-response ads are the bulk of its ad business. That compares with a company like Twitter which, as of February, said such ads accounted for just 15% of its mix. The differential explains why you likely find yourself idly scrolling past Twitter ads, but clicking on Instagram's.</p><p>It is true that Apple's recent privacy changes have made it more difficult for companies to track users' activity off their sites. Ironically, that has helped Meta to justify higher ad prices, even in the face of declining targeting ability.</p><p>Simply put, brands seem to need more help. This year thus far, Meta's ad pricing has grown an average of 33% -- 22 percentage points more than its average over the past five years.</p><p>Historically, ad pricing has ebbed as growth in the number of ads served has flowed and vice versa -- a balance likely as deliberate as it is delicate. Facebook can only own its advertisers if it also owns you.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
