  "text": "<p>\n  Gift giving? In this economy? We hear you. Creeping prices are this year's Grinch, so our team focused on essentials in our annual list of favorites. Throughout the year, we tested all sorts of gadgets, and only ones worth the money made it into this guide. We've even bought some for ourselves. </p><p>\n  This season, the best gear is stuff you and your loved ones will put to good use, such as a Wi-Fi-boosting Alexa speaker and a noise-canceling earbud upgrade. There are plenty of fun products, including a projector that plugs into a lightbulb socket, and a sensible splurge or two. An $1,100 vacuuming and mopping robot, anyone? </p><p>\n  The Wall Street Journal isn't compensated by the brands or retailers for being listed in this guide. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  EspressoDisplay Portable Monitor </p><p>\n  Portable monitors are the productivity gadgets working travelers didn't know they needed. The EspressoDisplay is among the sleekest options, with a super-thin, iMac-style aluminum frame and 1080p display. Upgrade options include touch-screen capability and several stands. The screen is USB-C-powered and has an extra port to charge your laptop. It comes in 13-inch and 15-inch variants, with the larger weighing under 2 pounds. </p><p>\n  $339 and up; espres.so </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Valve Steam Deck Hand-Held Game Console </p><p>\n  The Nintendo Switch hand-held remains wildly popular (and even hard to buy), but its catalog centers around Nintendo's tried-and-true family-friendly titles. Valve's Steam Deck -- a new, heftier entrant with powerful processors, 16GB of RAM and a wide seven-inch screen -- focuses on the more intense PC gaming the Valve's Steam platform already offers. Promised battery life ranges from two to eight hours, so it's probably good to keep a backup battery handy. </p><p>\n  $399 and up; steampowered.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Samsung Freestyle Projector </p><p>\n  Samsung's new portable projector, the Freestyle, is roughly the size of a peanut-butter jar, and can project an image up to 100 inches diagonally. It's powered by a standard wall plug, a USB-C smartphone battery pack or its own $190 battery base. It has Netflix, Hulu and other apps on board and can be a smart speaker and lighting system. An $80 adapter lets you screw the Freestyle into a standard lightbulb socket for overhead projection and mood lighting. </p><p>\n  $800; samsung.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  DribbleUp Smart Boxing Gloves </p><p>\n  Exercising from home became a necessity during the pandemic. For those who still prefer it, the DribbleUp Smart Boxing Gloves provide a simple, fun way for boxing noobs to work up a sweat in their living rooms. The app offers live and on-demand workouts, and tracks your punches and progress over time. There's a $17 monthly fee, though limited practice sessions are available if you don't pay. </p><p>\n  $50 (marked down from $150 through the holidays); dribbleup.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Fitbit Sense 2 Wearable </p><p>\n  Just starting a fitness journey? Fitbits are good coaches for getting more steps and sleep. The Sense 2 is more advanced than most, measuring skin temperature, blood oxygen and heart rhythm for atrial fibrillation. A sensor detects possible stress, then logs your mood and nudges you to guided breathing sessions. The Sense 2's biggest draw: how thin and light it is compared with other popular smartwatches. And it works with iOS and Android phones. </p><p>\n  $200; fitbit.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Giro Ethos Mips Turn-Signal Bike Helmet </p><p>\n  One bike tech trend we're excited about: integrated lights, especially in helmets. Giro is the latest maker of light-up head protection for bike commuters. The Ethos helmet has front and rear LEDs that provide four light modes (solid or flashing and high or low intensity) and can be turn signals, which you control using a paired controller attached to your handlebars. An optional eye shield adds protection and warmth in chilly weather. </p><p>\n  $250 and up; giro.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Garmin Epix Smartwatch </p><p>\n  The cult of Garmin watches is strong among sporty types who require long battery life, accurate GPS tracking, mapping capabilities and advanced training features. The trade-off for these impressive features had been a complicated five-button interface. The Epix has a touch screen, which simplifies many of those interactions. (To save power, you can disable touch.) The color display also makes deciphering trail maps easier. We recommend the Sapphire edition, with tougher glass for outdoor adventurers. </p><p>\n  $1,000; garmin.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Sony LinkBuds S </p><p>\n  For Android users -- or anyone preferring a bud-only, stemless design -- Sony's LinkBuds S have surprisingly good noise cancellation for their price. (You can find the buds on sale for less than list price at many retailers.) They're light and comfortable enough that you can tune out your colleagues all day. A Swift Pair feature automatically connects the earbuds to recent Windows devices, while integrated Google Fast Pair tech offers one-tap pairing with devices running Android 6 or later. </p><p>\n  $200; sony.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation </p><p>\n  Sure, these new Pros resemble their predecessors, but they have some sound upgrades: twice the noise-canceling power and a more natural-sounding transparency mode that can reduce extra-loud, hearing-damaging sounds. Best of all, the case now behaves like an AirTag. When you lose it in the couch cushions, your iPhone can ping it or point you in the right direction. The AirPods Pro still go flying if you're not careful about how you take off a sweater, however. </p><p>\n  $249; apple.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Apple Watch Ultra </p><p>\n  The bestselling Apple Watch has become a useful iPhone companion and health tracker, but most models need to be charged daily, which can be a pain. The chunky Ultra is the first with multiday battery life -- great for long-distance athletes or just anyone who wants more time on a single charge. It's no Garmin killer, but compared with other Apple Watch models, the Ultra has greater GPS accuracy and water resistance, as well as more glove-friendly physical buttons. </p><p>\n  $799; apple.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  RukusFX Hand-Held Music Maker </p><p>\n  If you've felt like your life is missing a soundtrack, check out the RukusFX hand-held music mixer with built-in microphone. This Gen Z-targeted musical toy can provide one-of-a-kind remixes in response to your hand gestures alone. After uploading tracks from your computer (or choosing from 120 preloaded songs), you punch, swipe, twist or flick your hands to make the tune your own. Luckily, there's a headphone jack, so no one else has to hear your RukusFX ruckus. </p><p>\n  $50; rukusfx.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Apple MacBook Air M2 </p><p>\n  Apple's latest Air laptop has a new M2 chip, but the surface improvements are the real allure. There's a bigger, brighter screen, higher-resolution webcam, larger top row of keys and the return of klutz-proof MagSafe charging -- plus new deep-blue and champagne color options. If the $200 price increase on entry-level MacBook Airs is a deal breaker, Apple is selling refurbished versions of its still-excellent M1 model at a discount. </p><p>\n  $1,199 and up; apple.com </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Echo Dot With Clock </p><p>\n  Amazon's newest talking speaker comes with a bonus: It doubles as a Wi-Fi extender. The fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock can add up to 1,000 square feet of coverage to an existing Eero mesh Wi-Fi network. (Amazon is also giving this capability to other new Echo speakers and some of the previous generation, too.) It also has better sound quality and an updated clock display that is also capable of scrolling information such as song titles and outside temperature. </p><p>\n  $60; amazon.com </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  For more Personal Tech gift suggestions, go to wsj.com/tech </p><p></p>",
