A China-backed study says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bc62132-e17f-4b36-aad1-c68c0eff20a5\">booster shots and antivirals</a> are urgently needed.</p></li>  <li><p>Kyiv was rocked today by “one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff7e8f7a-eb93-49b3-be49-6d0eeddd546b\">biggest attacks</a> since the beginning of the full-scale war” launched by Russia in February, prompting calls for more urgent shipments of military aid.</p></li>  <li><p>The UK has suffered another bout of bad economic news. Retail sales <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71921895-ec17-4532-a965-bbcc7468732c\">unexpectedly fell in November</a> by 0.4 per cent led by a drop in online sales, while consumer confidence hit its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d074c31c-1f14-43c1-9ae4-320fa7b854f8\">lowest sustained level for nearly 50 years</a> and the monthly PMI survey showed business activity declined for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bde8b35-aba8-4f95-a408-9a3789efd889#post-11bd45ee-b7ca-425e-8a68-cd8de9753569\">fifth consecutive month</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bde8b35-aba8-4f95-a408-9a3789efd889\"><em>live blog</em></a></p>  <p>Good evening,</p> <p>Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic opened up a new phase in the battle against inflation this week, but at the expense of setting off a new bout of investor jitters on the outlook for the world economy.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England all slowed the pace of interest rate rises, opting for 0.5 percentage point increases, but with a side order of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7f1d330-e2b5-4177-9060-3eb0f6194198\">hawkish comments</a>. </p> <p>Financial markets were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b39672fc-a60d-4cb2-bb3b-f659ea7d8ad1\">left “awestruck”</a> by the warnings that policy tightening was not yet over. “This is emerging market-type repricing post a central bank meeting, it's wild,” said one strategist. Hopes for a Christmas rally have been dashed.</p> <p>The Fed was first to move on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2e1baae-60b3-4719-98ba-e932acb5a285\">relaxing its policy tightening</a> after a series of 0.75 point increases, but also unveiling new projections that showed rates hitting a higher level than previously expected and staying there for an extended period. Growth will be slower and unemployment higher, it also suggested. </p> <p>This was despite news the day before showing consumer prices rising at their<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03d6abe-b305-4e45-b528-01f93671b4be\"> slowest pace in a year</a>, which had sent US shares and bonds surging. A top Fed official today reinforced the message that investors should not get too optimistic just yet, warning that rates could yet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59752345-b752-4167-9c6a-14718514b2fb\">exceed the 5.1 per cent level</a> forecast by most policymakers.</p> <p>The ECB followed suit on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c76d26a3-b103-49a3-92fe-ff50f8c9ac72\">raising rates to 2 per cent</a> and warning of more rises to come, with the even more hawkish stance of ECB chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01ee0fa6-fcb2-473e-8bdc-006a6cba89e6\">Christine Lagarde</a> reflecting the stickier nature of inflation in the eurozone. </p> <p>On the same day, the BoE increased rates to 3.5 per cent, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8c52506-f76b-4bb0-99fa-c92ae83236e5\">highest level in 14 years</a>. BoE governor Andrew Bailey said a tight labour market and rises in wages and prices justified a “further forceful monetary police response”.</p> <p>There were also increases in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8c5f57c-d0e3-428d-96fd-b9087e22ab78\">Switzerland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49e323be-2aa3-4958-9b9d-af960797a7ad#post-ccfa2244-ac6d-4b1b-9c6d-4f57d152fc9b\">Norway</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25dcb88f-531d-4491-800e-601666e6fd8d\">Mexico</a> and the Philippines. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bde8b35-aba8-4f95-a408-9a3789efd889#post-afb31e5c-cba8-4f3a-800a-abce4df7421d\">Russia's central bank</a> held rates steady at 7.5 per cent&#xa0;after months of successive cuts from the emergency 20 per cent rate it set after the invasion of Ukraine in February.</p> <p>Although factors such as falling inflation and smaller US rate rises may give hope to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28dd63ac-4e2e-4cdc-ac25-6691902494af\">emerging markets</a>, the overall message from developed economies is clear: the battle against price and wage rises is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac621c8b-74b5-441f-a7f5-b733687210ac\">not yet complete</a>.</p> <h1>Need to know: UK and Europe economy</h1> <p>The PMI reading for the <strong>eurozone</strong> was more hopeful than the UK's, bringing more signs that the coming recession would be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bde8b35-aba8-4f95-a408-9a3789efd889#post-49d66711-c25c-4329-9d7b-adb170431b18\">milder than initially feared</a>.</p> <p><strong>Russian crude oil</strong> is being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41237fe7-210d-406c-a22a-2e17a79f7381\">shipped to India</a> on tankers insured by western companies, in the first sign that Moscow has gone back on its vow to block sales under the G7-imposed price cap.</p> <p>The second Big Read in our series on <strong>Russia's beleaguered economy</strong> examines the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe5fe0ed-e5d4-474e-bb5a-10c9657285d2\">fate of the technocrats</a>. Once seen as modernisers and a counterbalance to Putin's hardline security service veterans, they have seen their influence diminish and failed to speak out against the war. The US has imposed sanctions on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2d063a9-313f-4584-b205-7a2283f13eb5\">Vladimir Potanin</a>, the nickel tycoon and one of Russia's wealthiest oligarchs.</p> <h1>Need to know: Global economy</h1> <p>Despite pledges at UN climate talks, <strong>global coal use</strong> will reach a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/017c9e1e-3069-4bf3-8335-f1404abd6eb0\">record level this year</a> and stay high until 2024 because of the war in Ukraine and rising demand in India and China.</p> <p><strong>New Zealand's</strong> economy grew by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b217ce95-8ee0-4fe9-a9b5-8615086535f6\">“whopping” 2 per cent</a> in the three months to September — double the amount expected — thanks to a rebound in construction, services and tourism when the country reopened its borders. Some see the growth as vindication of the central bank's ultra-hawkish stance to tackle inflation.</p> <p><strong>Peru</strong> is in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1036fcfb-f43b-4a82-8d2d-bf8c087646b4\">30-day state of emergency</a> as its fragile interim government tries to quell protests that erupted after former president Pedro Castillo's failed attempt last week to seize extraordinary powers.</p> <p><em>Homecoming</em>, the new book from FT columnist <strong>Rana Foroohar</strong>, offers a prescription for the “post-global era that listens less to the interests of Wall Street and more to the interests of ‘people and place'”. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2738868e-7457-4985-9721-dd914fdf475f\">Read the review</a>.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>The US has put another 36 Chinese companies on its <strong>trade blacklist</strong> aimed at slowing Beijing's development of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ddb2288-6bae-4672-8bf6-e51d79ca29c3\">advanced microchips</a> and technologies that could be used for military purposes.
