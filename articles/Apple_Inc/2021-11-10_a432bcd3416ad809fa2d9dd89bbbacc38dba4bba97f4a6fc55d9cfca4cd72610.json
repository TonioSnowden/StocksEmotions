  "text": "<p>Eleven years ago, American journalist Joe Nocera bought a home in the Hamptons next to the biggest house on the street. He had scarcely unwrapped the crockery when an invitation to a barbecue arrived from next door via the gardener. It came from one Dr Isaac Herschkopf, a New York psychiatrist known to friends and clients as Dr Ike, though it wasn't until several months and a handful of parties later that he realised the owner of the house wasn't Ike but the man he assumed was the gardener.</p> <p>Nocera ended up making a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3268ec3e-838f-11e9-a7f0-77d3101896ec\">podcast</a> about Herschkopf and how, over 30 years, he had inveigled his way into the life of one of his patients, Marty Markowitz, taking over his business and his home and isolating him from friends and family. The series was a huge success and, spying a crossover hit, TV networks soon came knocking.</p> <p>Written and developed by Georgia Pritchett (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc7d607d-84a0-40dc-b6e4-e7a0e881c83f\"><em>Succession</em></a> and <em>Veep</em>) and directed by Michael Showalter (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71f3f794-72bc-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c\"><em>The Big Sick</em></a>), this adaptation opens, fittingly, in the middle of a garden party in 2010. We meet the charming and solicitous Dr Ike (Paul Rudd) as he moves through the assembled throng complimenting guests on their golf swing and urging them to try the hot tub. Only after the sun has set and the guests departed, leaving behind a sea of glass-strewn tables, does a shadowy figure in a baseball cap emerge, pull out a golf club and smash everything to pieces. </p> <p>The action then jumps back to 1982 and a 40-year-old Marty (Will Ferrell) who is running a Manhattan fabrics company and struggling with self-esteem issues that go back to his childhood, when he spent his bar mitzvah locked in the toilet. When his sister Phyllis (Kathryn Hahn) suggests he sees a therapist, he is resistant — “I'm fine” he protests, shortly after a panic attack — but then he gives in, because giving in is what Marty does best. Enter the young Dr Ike, who dazzles Marty with his giant smile, his common sense analysis and precision-tooled guilt tactics. “You let people take advantage of you,” he tells him, sympathetically.</p> <p>Rudd's casting is smart, allowing him to deploy the warmth and <em>joie de vivre</em> that has carried him through countless big-screen comedies, though cranking it up to a level marked “queasy”. The role of hopeless naïf is also a familiar one for Ferrell, though it is less successful here; conjuring the ghost of Buddy, his lumbering man-child in 2003's <em>Elf</em>, probably isn't what the producers had in mind.</p> <p>The story is undoubtedly compelling but, given how swiftly the doctor-patient boundaries are breached, you wonder how <em>The Shrink Next Door</em> can sustain the dramatic tension across eight episodes. In the podcast, Nocera's dog-with-a-bone digging allowed for quizzical reflection not just on what happened but why. Here, with behavioural patterns established early, there is no real guesswork to be done, although one mystery remains. With Nocera excised from the story, the more pedantic viewer is left looking at the title and wondering: “Next door to whom, exactly?”</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV Plus from November 12</em></p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2021 'Paul Rudd gets inside Will Ferrell's head in The Shrink Next Door' FT.com 10 November.
