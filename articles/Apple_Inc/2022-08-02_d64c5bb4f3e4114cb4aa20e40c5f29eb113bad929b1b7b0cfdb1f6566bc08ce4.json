  "title": "College Affirmative Action Policies Backed by Major Companies; Apple, General Motors, Lyft among those urging Supreme Court to affirm the practice",
  "text": "<p>Signatories to the brief titled, \"major American business enterprises,\" included tech giants such as Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit; manufacturers including Corning Inc. and General Motors Co., pharma and biotech companies and transportation operators such as American Airlines Group Inc. and Lyft Inc. The brief cited reports published by journals including the Academy of Management Journal, Corporate Governance, and the Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting.</p><p>Other companies joined separate briefs supporting the colleges. No businesses filed briefs opposed to the university policies.</p><p>The Supreme Court is slated in its next term to hear separate cases challenging admissions practices at Harvard College and the University of North Carolina, private and public institutions that consider race when evaluating applicants. Admission to both universities is competitive: Harvard, the nation's oldest college, accepted 3.19% of 61,220 applicants for the class of 2026; UNC, the state's flagship, reported an in-state acceptance rate of 42.2% and 10.5% for out-of-state students among 53,775 applications for fall 2021.</p><p>A group backed by former stockbroker Edward Blum, Students for Fair Admissions, sued Harvard and UNC alleging that their consideration of race violates constitutional equal-protection provisions. In particular, the plaintiffs allege that admissions policies provide unfair advantages to Black, Hispanic and Native American applicants over their white and Asian American counterparts.</p><p>\"Harvard insinuated that it uses race as one small factor to break ties between qualified candidates, [but] it actually obsesses over race throughout its process and awards massive preferences to certain groups,\" the plaintiffs argue in legal papers.</p><p>The universities say they consider applicants individually and view race as only one factor among myriad others in assembling an entering class.</p><p>The 14th Amendment's equal protection clause and corresponding provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have generally been read to prohibit official classifications of individuals based on race. Historians and legal scholars have argued over whether the 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 in large part to protect Black Americans freed from slavery, allows official efforts to correct racial inequality or requires strict colorblindness.</p><p>A federal-district court in Boston held a trial over Harvard's admissions process and found it constitutional, a decision affirmed by the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. A federal-district court in Winston-Salem, N.C., likewise upheld the UNC policy.</p><p>Mr. Blum declined to comment on the business briefs.</p><p>Affirmative action in admissions has returned repeatedly to the Supreme Court since 1978, when in the case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the court found a compelling government interest in promoting racial diversity and allowed consideration of race so long as it wasn't through a rigid quota or hard numerical benefit.</p><p>In a 2003 decision affirming race-conscious admissions to the University of Michigan Law School, the court specifically cited briefs by major businesses attesting to the importance of diversity in the workplace.</p><p>\"These benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,\"Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote then for the court.</p><p>Mr. Blum previously has backed challenges to race-conscious admissions at the University of Texas, but, most recently in 2016, the Supreme Court left them intact. Since casting key votes in affirmative cases, Justices Kennedy and O'Connor have retired, leaving today's more conservative court likely to be more skeptical of the universities' arguments.</p><p>The major-businesses brief cited a 2014 study published by the National Academy of Sciences that \"found that traders in ethnically homogenous markets were 'significantly less accurate' in making pricing decisions 'and thus more likely to cause price bubbles,'\" the brief said.</p><p>The major-business brief said that employers depend on universities to prepare qualified workers, and have longstanding partnerships with campus career offices to identify candidates. \"Although they do not take a position on the constitutionality of the specific practices at issue here,\" the companies \"reiterate to this Court that the government's interest in promoting student-body diversity on university campuses remains compelling from a business perspective.\"</p><p>Argument dates haven't yet been set, but the cases are slated to be heard during the court's next term, which begins in October.</p><p>Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin+1@wsj.com</p><p>College Affirmative Action Policies Backed by Major Companies</p>",
