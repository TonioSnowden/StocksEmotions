  "text": "<p>New Release: 'Electric Easy'</p><p>(Spotify, Apple Podcasts)</p><p>Kesha says the two things she missed the most during pandemic lockdowns and closures were seeing her family and going to drag shows. The pop star, raised by a single mother who was a songwriter, says from an early age she got to know members of the queer community. Looking back, she credits the community with helping raise her.</p><p>\"Not only in music, but in culture and in life, it's given me a safe place,\" she says, noting, \"I always had permission to be exactly who I am and attracted to whomever I was attracted to.\"</p><p>Kesha is an executive producer, co-star and music writer for a new science-fiction podcast called \"Electric Easy,\" about a marginalized community. The story is set in a future Los Angeles where humanoid robots, known as \"electrics,\" and humans, often referred to as \"bios,\" are segregated. Electrics are produced and sold into indentured servitude.</p><p>The story begins in a nightclub, Electric Easy, where an electric named Vector (Chloe Bailey) performs and is supported by her friends, including Zephyr (Kesha), an electric sex worker who also runs an ice-cream truck.</p><p>The podcast -- produced by QCODE Media, a studio known for celebrity-fronted scripted podcasts -- was created by Vanya Asher and co-stars Mason Gooding. The first three episodes are streaming on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and other podcast services.</p><p>Kesha says the podcast became a passion project during the pandemic, and an opportunity to visit the closed nightclubs that feel like home to her.</p><p>\"Whenever I go to a gay bar, a drag show, that's when I feel the most myself,\" she says. \"I'm not going to be judged, and I can just be myself, and it's such a relief when you feel like you can truly be yourself.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Impeachment: American Crime Story</p><p>(FX, FX Now)</p><p>\"Impeachment: American Crime Story,\" the third installment of FX's anthology series, looks at the impeachment of Bill Clinton through the prism of some of the women who were at the center of the scandal: Linda Tripp, Paula Jones and, of course, Monica Lewinsky.</p><p>At the top, the story is told through the eyes of Sarah Paulson's Linda Tripp, seen here as a West Wing aide who is banished to the Pentagon, where she channels her bitterness into a relationship with a new arrival: Beanie Feldstein's Monica Lewinsky. The cast includes Annaleigh Ashford as Paula Jones, Edie Falco as Hillary Clinton, Cobie Smulders as Ann Coulter, George Salazar as George Conway and Clive Owen as President Clinton. The series premiered Tuesday on FX and can be streamed at FXnetworks.com and on the FX Now app.</p><p>Sarah Burgess, the showrunner, head writer and executive producer of \"Impeachment,\" says Ms. Lewinsky, a producer on the series, played a critical role behind the scenes, going over every page of every script and providing detailed notes on topics both intense and ephemeral.</p><p>\"I'm writing in the point of view of young Monica, but also the point of view of people who really blew up her life,\" says Ms. Burgess, \"and she's taking in all of that and giving it in her unvarnished direct thoughts. Monica is a very honest, transparent, direct person, which I love about her.\"</p>",
