  "text": "<p>Born in Washington to a doctor and an amateur singer, Walker was a dapper man who received many commissions and honors during his lifetime. Yet his sometimes cerebral music remains unfamiliar to many classical concertgoers. Even his most popular piece, the poignant \"Lyric for Strings\" (1946, revised 1990), had only 15 performances in 2017 according to his publisher. That number skyrocketed to 223 in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic, when orchestras were scrambling to program fewer works requiring potentially virus-spreading brass or woodwinds and more pieces by people of color.</p><p>Now a fresh wave of prominent conductors, including Gianandrea Noseda, Simon Rattle and Jaap van Zweden, are revealing the expressionist beauty of other Walker scores. To mark the centenary of the composer's birth, Mr. Noseda and the National Symphony Orchestra are recording performances of his five sinfonias at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for the NSO label. The first release, \"George Walker: Sinfonia No. 4 (Strands),\" will be available June 24 as a music video on Apple Music's \"Classical Live\" playlist. Other streaming services will offer the audio version beginning July 8. The fitful, less appealing Sinfonia No. 1 will follow in October. In the future, the NSO and Mr. Noseda, its music director, will release the complete set on SACD.</p><p>\"Strands\" (2011), which the NSO co-commissioned, is among the strongest of the sinfonias. Mr. Noseda's taut, expressive performance better conveys the overall shape and drama of the work than Ian Hobson's 2013 recording with the Sinfonia Varsovia for Albany Records, an early, loyal advocate of Walker's compositions. And the polished, richly colored playing of the NSO proves an additional asset.</p><p>There's an aura of disquiet about \"Strands.\" Loosely atonal, the piece is characterized by brooding passages and accented, Stravinskian rhythms. Slivers of two spirituals are among its compositional building blocks. Subtle jazz influences, adroitly illuminated by Mr. Noseda and the NSO, are evident in walking bass-style segments that undergird little percussive outbursts. A highlight is a brief tranquil respite that Walker fashions from the opening notes of \"There is a Balm in Gilead.\" Equally definitive future recordings of his other works will enable us to take a fuller measure of Walker's artistry.</p><p>***</p><p>In 2012, an album by composer and keyboard artist Max Richter reimagined Vivaldi's ubiquitous but irresistible \"The Four Seasons\" (c. 1720). The result—\"Recomposed by Max Richter\"—topped classical charts in 22 countries and, according to record label Deutsche Grammophon, has now been streamed about 450 million times. \"Recomposed,\" beautifully performed by violinist Daniel Hope and the Konzerthaus Kammerorchester Berlin, brought post-minimalist sensibilities and soaring film-score melodies to Vivaldi's Baroque hit, reportedly jettisoning about three-quarters of the original. Excerpts from the album have been used effectively in soundtracks, including that of the popular Netflix series \"The Crown.\"</p><p>\"Max Richter: The New Four Seasons,\" released June 10, also for Deutsche Grammophon, revisits his first Vivaldi album on period instruments, played by the versatile members of the Chineke! Orchestra. (Incidentally, Chineke! will present Walker's \"Lilacs\" at a BBC Proms concert in September.) That's a valid approach, yet there are curious aspects to this vibrantly performed endeavor. If Mr. Richter wanted to do a period-instrument version, why not use an established period-instrument ensemble? Instead, members of Chineke! outfitted their usual modern instruments with gut strings and swapped their bows for lighter-weight Baroque equivalents. Similarly, if Mr. Richter wanted to bring the majority black Chineke! players to wider attention, having worked with them before, why not do a different project?</p><p>These questions aside, the album may win Mr. Richter new fans. Violinist Elena Urioste is the superb soloist, contributing dizzying, cascading passages one moment and lovely Baroque ornamental flourishes the next. Starting with \"Summer,\" tempos generally run somewhat faster than in \"Recomposed\"; this helps temper Mr. Richter's slightly saccharine additions to Vivaldi's score, as does the substitution of a 1970s Moog synthesizer for the earlier recording's blander digital accompaniment. In the fastest segments, the otherwise expert Chineke! players may not exhibit quite the virtuosic ease of leading period instrument groups, but they render the high-wire intensity of Mr. Richter's re-creation even better than the Konzerthaus Kammerorchester did. By contrast, Vivaldi's pictorially splendid original sounds tame.</p><p>Ms. Jepson reviews classical albums and concerts for the Journal.</p><p>Reappraisals and Retunings: New Albums of Music by George Walker and Max Richter</p>",
