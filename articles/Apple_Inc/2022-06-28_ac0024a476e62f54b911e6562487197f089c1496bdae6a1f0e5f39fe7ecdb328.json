  "text": "<p>For the recurring series, That's Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and the other emphatically opposed.</p><p>IN JOANNAH PICKETT'S line of work, communication and first impressions are vital. And as that work has increasingly moved online, the associate vice president of the department of Alumni Relations &amp; Development at Trinity University in San Antonio and her team are often making those first impressions via emails. When Ms. Pickett, 47, noticed her colleagues sending messages with sloppy text—including misspelled words and incorrectly used prepositions—she asked them to download the free version of Grammarly, a free-to-download typing and proofreading assistant.</p><p>The free version of the software functions like a more sophisticated version of the spell-check tool in Google Docs or Microsoft Word, except it works anywhere you type. Writing an email? Grammarly will notice that you've misspelled \"synergy.\" Filling out a job application? Grammarly will notice that you've used \"effect\" when you meant \"affect.\" Firing off a spicy Tweet? Grammarly might tell you that your tone is a bit accusatory. (Unfortunately, it cannot prevent you from sending it off anyway.) If you're willing to spend $30 a month (or $144 for a year) for Grammarly Premium, you'll unlock more kinds of suggested edits, including ones that tackle your formatting and repetitive language.</p><p>Since the company was founded in 2009, its software has ballooned in popularity. In 2020, the company boasted 30 million active users. It's likely that many of these people found out about the service through the company's digital advertising—according to a report from Winmo, a cloud-based sales prospecting tool, Grammarly spent over $100 million in the first quarter of 2019 alone, and was the highest spending YouTube advertiser in the period by far.</p><p>The strategy might have brought the company downloads, but it hasn't always made it well-liked. On Urban Dictionary, a website that can serve as a helpful glossary of internet slang and opinion, Grammarly is defined as \"the reason ad blockers exist.\" The service is also regularly maligned on social media sites for misguided or annoying edits. So, for all the companies' advertising bluster, is the service actually making us clearer and more concise writers? Here, we present both sides.</p><p>Yes, Grammarly offers useful suggestions that make your writing easier to understand</p><p>No proofreading tool is perfect—we all have stories of how Apple's autocorrect has twisted our words at inopportune moments. But fans of Grammarly say it offers mostly helpful suggestions on improving your writing. Even without paying for the $30-a-month premium service, you can download the software and immediately access its punctuation, grammar and phrasing suggestions wherever you are typing, be that in an email, a job application portal, an essay on Google Docs or a tweet. And unlike autocorrect, the program gives you the choice to go with its suggestions or what you've already written. So if it offers you a change that feels at odds with your voice, or on the rare occasion the suggested change is flat out wrong, you can choose to ignore it.</p><p>Having that second line of defense against typos has made Grammarly invaluable for some professionals. \"I trust it more than I trust my…own checking,\" said Ms. Pickett, who describes her work pace as \"harried and chaotic.\" She maintains that good grammar is paramount if one wants to be taken seriously. \"While a wrinkled shirt or some misspellings may not matter to other generations, those in leadership still care, as do many people at the heads of their industry,\" executives with whom she needs to work and negotiate. \"Proper grammar just starts you off on the right foot.\"</p><p>Even professional writers and editors, particularly journalists, have adopted the tool. As their industry has gone digital, people like Gabrielle Healy, 26, a digital editor, are being asked to write and edit faster than ever before. Without the time to proofread herself, Ms. Healy started to notice that typos were slipping through the cracks. After she downloaded Grammarly, she was able to get them under control. \"I'm constantly catching errors with it…. I [needed] the hand.\" she said.</p><p>No, Grammarly doesn't live up to its promises to catch errors and improve your writing</p><p>Zoe Burke first encountered Grammarly as an English major in college through targeted Google ads. That it not only helped fix typos and missing punctuation, but also improved style and tone made it stand out from other built-in proofreading tools. But as she continued her studies, eventually earning her master's degree in English from the University of Dayton and joining its faculty as an instructor, she noticed the software missing errors and overcorrecting. When she ran her Master's Thesis, about a composition course she was teaching, through the program, she said, \"Grammarly kept wanting to change 'composing' to 'composting.'\"</p><p>Though the company promises to help people become better writers, Ms. Burke questions that claim, especially if users don't already have a firm grasp of the laws of language. \"These folks trust the program to be right, and…the program isn't always right,\" she said. \"You're not going to learn from Grammarly, but your writing can become more polished if you use it.\"</p><p>Audio producer and podcast host Ronald Young Jr., 38, echoes that sentiment: \"Being a good writer takes practice. Autocorrecting software keeps you from making common mistakes [but] you still have to know how to communicate effectively outside of the basics of grammar.\"</p><p>A Grammarly spokeswoman said that its team is constantly working to improve the user experience. \"We humbly recognize that the product is far from perfect and that the linguistic challenges are plentiful.\"</p><p>Mr. Young says he wouldn't consider upgrading to Grammarly Premium. \"With gas prices being where they are…I really don't need another something to subscribe to.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Has Grammarly made you a better or worse writer?
