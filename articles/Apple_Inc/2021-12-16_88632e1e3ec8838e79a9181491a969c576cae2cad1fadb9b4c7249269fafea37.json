  "title": "Year in Review (A Special Report): Technology  ---  Metaverse: Next Big Thing?  Advocates say more immersive interfaces will increase our sense of presence. They may have their definitions wrong.  ----  By Steven Johnson",
  "text": "<p>   Mark Zuckerberg would like you to be a little more present. </p><p>   That's the message that the Facebook founder hammers home in one of the most elaborate concept videos ever produced by a tech company: an 80-minute video rolling out his company's vision of \"the metaverse,\" which Mr. Zuckerberg believes is the next paradigm shift in computing. The video -- and Facebook's decision to re-christen itself with the new corporate name Meta Platforms Inc. -- marked a fitting endpoint for a year in which the somewhat murky concept of the metaverse became one of the most hyped buzzwords in technology. </p><p>   Mr. Zuckerberg's primary complaint about the existing interfaces we use today is that they aren't immersive enough. When we interact with our friends or colleagues virtually, we're experiencing a heavily mediated version of them -- email threads, text messages, grainy Zoom videos with choppy audio. And all of that interaction is compressed through a two-dimensional screen, often the size of a pack of playing cards. </p><p>   \"Screens . . . can't deliver that deep feeling of presence,\" he says at one point in the video. \"Presence is the defining quality of the metaverse.\" </p><p>   Put aside the fact that Facebook/Meta may not be high on some people's list of companies to shape the next-generation architecture of the internet. Is Mr. Zuckerberg correct that the metaverse is the inevitable next leap forward in computer interfaces? </p><p>   Modern computing history has seen three \"inevitable\" paradigm shifts in how we interact with our digital devices, advances that began as fringe experiences but swiftly became ubiquitous: the graphic interface popularized by Apple's Macintosh in the 1980s; the hypertext links of the web; and the multitouch interface, now almost without exception the standard interface for all mobile interactions. </p><p>   Will the metaverse version of the user interface find its way into this pantheon? Instead of flat screens with layered windows and icons, think 3-D immersive places that you visit, using either augmented-reality glasses or virtual-reality goggles. Early in his promotional video, Mr. Zuckerberg drops into a metaverse card game with four other colleagues in a simulated space station hovering above Earth. Some participants are cartoon avatars of themselves; one has reimagined himself as a 10-foot-tall robot sporting a green visor. </p><p>   For its advocates, this kind of experience promises to liberate us from the fragmented, two-dimensional experience of our screens. Some of that liberation does suggest new creative possibilities. Architects, for instance, may develop a whole new line of work designing virtual spaces for public gatherings in the metaverse. </p><p>   But there is something fundamentally odd about describing these sorts of immersive spaces using the language of presence. To create the \"consensual hallucination\" of the metaverse, to borrow a phrase from sci-fi author William Gibson, all the participants have to be strapped into a VR headset, cut off from reality. And it is simply not clear whether this is a physical experience that most people want to have on a regular basis. </p><p>   Past interface revolutions steered our machines toward more human-centric ways of representing information. Virtual reality, for all its creative possibilities, demands that you adopt a fundamentally unnatural relationship to your surroundings. Even augmented reality -- where digital information is projected onto real-world environments through special glasses -- is unlikely to make us feel more \"present.\" Every conversation will be haunted by the possibility that your counterpart is checking a stock ticker or watching YouTube videos out of the corner of their eye. </p><p>   For most of us, I suspect, presence doesn't mean dressing up as an oversize robot floating in a space station. It means experiencing our friends and family through the full bandwidth of human connection: facial expressions, subtle vocal cues, all experienced in an environment that we can feel and touch with our unmediated senses. We aren't far from a world where we can have remote conversations with people where their images are captured in 8K video and full-fidelity sound, and displayed life-size on a wall-mounted screen. That sort of interface would create a powerful illusion of presence without goggles or glasses. </p><p>   Then there's the problem of movement. In the Meta promotional video, we see numerous sequences where users are actively exploring a fully virtual environment -- particularly when playing games or exercising. Needless to say, this requires a lot of empty space to make it work in practice. Having a fencing match with a virtual opponent in the middle of a tropical rainforest may sound appealing -- until you accidentally trip over your real-world coffee table. </p><p>   It is true that VR technology can scan rooms to create boundaries to protect you from unwanted collisions, but if we're going to be doing extensive physical activity in the metaverse, we're going to need a lot of empty space, preferably lined with Nerf-like surfaces to soften the inevitable blows. </p><p>   Perhaps we will eventually have empty \"imagination rooms\" in our homes where we can explore the metaverse without physical impediments. It sounds appealing when described with that language: Who wouldn't want a room dedicated to imagination? </p><p>   Then again, you could just as accurately call it a padded cell. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Johnson is an author of many books, most recently \"Extra Life: A Short History of Living Longer.\" He writes the newsletter Adjacent Possible.
