  "text": "<p>\n  Slough House </p><p>\n  By Mick Herron </p><p>\n  Soho Crime, 301 pages, $27.95 </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Like Patrick O'Brian, who ultimately found his sweet spot in the Royal Navy of the early 19th century, Mick Herron eventually found his in Britain's domestic intelligence service of the present day. Out of a wickedly imagined version of MI5, he has spun works of diabolical plotting and high-spirited cynicism, their pages filled with sardonic wit, their characters approaching the surreal. Up until a little over 10 years ago, Mr. Herron had produced a four-novel sequence starring a female PI, a stand-alone spy novel involving MI6 and a collection of short stories. Though entertaining enough, the books lack the animating genius of the seven novels and three novellas that make up his current series. Inevitably, and we hope with an appropriate degree of mordant humor, the books are now the basis for a television series, coming from Apple, starring Gary Oldman, Olivia Cooke, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jonathan Pryce and Jack Lowden. </p><p>\n  \"Slough House\" is the latest installment. At its center is the selfsame Slough House, a decrepit building and moribund home to a collection of losers, screwups and scapegoats unfondly referred to as the \"slow horses.\" The presiding deity of this \"administrative oubliette of the Intelligence Service\" is Jackson Lamb, a former spy -- or \"joe,\" in the bespoke lingo of the Slough House universe. Nasty, brutish and fat, he is, nonetheless, ahead of every game, a master of legerdemain who can produce a cigarette, a gun or himself seemingly out of thin air. Though he berates and belittles his minions, he is, in the end, intensely loyal to them, and a miraculous appearance by this repulsive man has time and again saved the day. </p><p>\n  Sharing center stage with Lamb in the series is River Cartwright, whose early career was blown up by a training exercise gone terribly wrong thanks to the machinations of a rival. River is the grandson of David Cartwright, aka the O.B. or Old Bastard, a legendary Cold War spy who brought River up when his mother vamoosed and his father -- well, that's a story I cannot reveal. Among River's fellow exiles are a former drunk with a \"wine-dark past,\" a violent cocaine addict, a nymphomaniac, a self-styled action hero and computer nerd, a compulsive gambler, a traumatized, murderous loner and other poor saps who have run afoul of the big bugs in the Service. As mortality is high among these unfortunates, it is best to read the books in order. </p><p>\n  Pitted against Slough House is Regent's Park, headquarters of the Service. It can be said to operate under London Rules, an informal credo whose first tenet is \"cover your arse.\" All other rules follow from that, and the agency's big shots have no scruples about sacrificing personnel to cover up blunders and maleficence. For a time the Park's senior official was Dame Ingrid Tearney, \"a sweet old lady who drank fresh blood for breakfast.\" A grotesque little creature, she occupied First Desk -- the Service's top spot in its own parlance -- until she was ousted some books ago. </p><p>\n  Before Dame Ingrid was forced from the scene, she articulated as plainly as anyone the altered mission of today's intelligence service: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  It used to be simpler. There was the Service, and there were the nation's enemies. These changed identity every so often, depending on who'd been elected, deposed or assassinated, but by and large the boundaries were clear: you spied on your foes, kept tabs on the neutrals, and every so often got a chance to fuck up your friends in a plausibly deniable way. A bit like school, but with fewer rules. Nowadays, though, in between monitoring the nation's phone calls and scanning the latest whistle-blower's Twitter feed, geopolitics barely got a look in. If asked to list the threats to the nation's security, Ingrid Tearney would start with ministers and colleagues. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Tearney, victim of her own overreach and the animosity of her subordinates, was replaced first by a hapless man and now by former Second Desk (Ops) Diana Taverner, Lady Di to her many foes. A backstabber of the first order, she is a good-looking, indefatigable schemer, whose intrigues invariably go off the rails in lethal ways. </p><p>\n  That's the setup as we open \"Slough House.\" The story revolves around another of Taverner's ambitious, misbegotten projects -- this one so enterprising and unscrupulous that one can't help thinking that it has precedent in the real world. Matters get underway with the assassination of a female Russian agent in Kazan by a freelancer hired by Taverner with off-the-book funds secured from a private source. As the dead woman was one of V. Putin's operatives, there will be payback, \"titting the Park's tat,\" as one character puts it. This, for a reason later revealed, puts the slow horses in the crosshairs, although, in the view of Diana Taverner, past and present members of Slough House are nothing if not expendable. </p><p>\n  Far more worrisome than anything a mere Putin could throw at her are the subsequent demands of the man who supplied the cash for the hit. This is Damien Cantor, owner of Channel Go, a confrontational \"rolling news channel\" whose \"general thrust was to encourage choleric rage in its viewers.\" Taverner had assumed that the money, further injections of which were promised and welcomed, would free her from the bean counters who have become more close-fisted than ever with Brexit. She would dearly like to tighten up the Service's cybersecurity, so vulnerable to hackers that, as she muses with distaste, \"you were only one hack away from open government.\" But horrors! She now finds that Cantor considers her under obligation to carry out his designs, which, as it happens, dovetail with the ambitions of the man who brokered the deal, a juicy old player from the past, the \"public buffoon and private velociraptor\" Peter Judd. </p><p>\n  A \"loose cannon with a floppy haircut and a bicycle,\" Judd was once Home Secretary with an eye on 10 Downing Street -- though as Taverner notes, \"your mirror image has got there instead.\" As a result of certain missteps chronicled in a previous volume, Judd has retired from active -- or at least visible -- politics. Now he has plans for the future with Taverner as his tool. We'll see about that, for this is only one element in this hectic plot, an elaborate boobytrap of misdirection and wrong-footing. </p><p>\n  Mr. Herron's series captures and builds on the noxious spirit of the age, of disillusion and fanaticism, and brings special attention to increasingly dysfunctional government intelligence agencies, self-aggrandizing organizations where secrecy and covert operations flourish, where blame-shifting is routine and obfuscation house style. (\"Ingrid Tearney had enormous faith in Regent's Park's ability to render all and any information in its possession incomprehensible -- it was, after all, a branch of the Civil Service.\") Mr. Herron goes about this with bouncing black humor and a set of characters whose appearance and manner would be over the top in any other era. Happily for Mr. Herron -- if alas for us -- events continue to produce rich material for his special gifts, and we hope he is scribbling away making good use of it all. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Ms. Powers is a recipient of the National Book Critics Circle's Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing. </p><p></p>",
