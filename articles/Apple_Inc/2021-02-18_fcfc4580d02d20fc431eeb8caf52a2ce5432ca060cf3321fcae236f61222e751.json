  "title": "Christie's gets digital with the art world's non-fungible craze",
  "text": "<p>The art market's latest craze is for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and this month Christie's will be the first major auction house to offer a digital work in this format. NFTs essentially stamp the art on the blockchain and — for works made virtually — are proving appealing. A permanent record of creation and ownership helps get over potential problems of unlimited duplication, so a tradeable secondary market becomes possible.</p> <p>Christie's will auction an NFT-based work by Beeple, one of the best-known digital artists, whose pseudonym was taken from a 1980s soft toy brand. His work, “Everydays — The First 5000 Days” (2021) combines 5,000 images that Beeple has made every day since May 1, 2007, and was officially minted this week. The work comes to auction online between February 25 and March 11, wisely with an “unknown” estimated value. Bidding will start at just $100, a level that seems to reflect the embryonic nature of the market while leaving plenty of room for bubble-like upside.&#xa0;</p> <p>The NFT art craze has the feel of a well-marketed fad for a virtual time but its proponents compare the nascent market to that for street art, a phenomenon that was initially dismissed but is now embraced. NFT art is certainly attracting money: at the end of last year, 20 of Beeple's works sold on the specialist platform Nifty for a total of $3.5m.</p> <p>The American graphic designer, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, works in a futuristic, sci-fi style and says he likes to investigate power dynamics between politics and technology. He is 39 but employs enough irreverence and self-deprecation to raise a Generation Z smile — his Instagram handle is @beeple_crap and has 1.8m followers. Of his market he tells me over Zoom: “It has definitely been a lot to take in. I've been doing this for a long time but in the past few months the whole space seems to be catching fire.”&#xa0;</p>  <p>Hauser &amp; Wirth Menorca will open on July 17 with an exhibition of new paintings and sculptures by its superstar artist Mark Bradford. The long-awaited, 1,500-sq-metre arts centre is on the Isla del Rey, a 10-minute boat ride from Mahon port, and has undergone two years of restoration and conservation of its protected buildings and surrounding ecology. Manuela Wirth, co-president of the gallery, describes the island off an island as an “utterly magical site . . . completely immersed in nature and exposed to wind, sun and rain”. Their new exhibition space comprises eight galleries, a shop and a restaurant, in buildings that had been abandoned for 60 years, she says.</p> <p>Confirmation of the Hauser &amp; Wirth opening provides a cultural boost in the midst of the pandemic's gloom. Menorca's museums are currently open under social-distancing rules and Bradford's show will have a relatively long run — until October 30 — to enable more visitors, the gallery confirms. For the artist, it will be his first show since lockdown. He says: “For the past year it's felt like we're living on Mars, masked up, suited up, six feet apart on ground that just won't stop moving. Eventually you've got to decide to move with it.”&#xa0;</p>  <p>Frieze, the magazine to art fair business, has turned landlord by taking on two townhouses in London's Mayfair to rent out to visiting galleries through the year. The model is similar to Cromwell Place, a gallery hub that opened in London last year, though on a smaller scale, with space for just three galleries for approximately four weeks at a time. “With ideas around locality, physicality and time particularly pertinent right now, the pop-up model allows for a more in-depth look at specific projects,” says Eva Langret, artistic director of Frieze London.&#xa0;</p> <p>The venture should also bring in some welcome revenue at a tricky time for art fairs. Participation fees range from £29,000 to £55,500 for the run, depending on the time of year and size of space. If fully occupied, No9 Cork Street could bring in nearly £800,000 per year. It is set to open in October and Frieze will announce the participating galleries in the summer.&#xa0;</p>  <p>Sotheby's has a rare, silver-inlaid astrological basin that dates back to Persia circa 1200 and will offer it for between £1m and £1.5m at its next Islamic art auction on March 31. Measuring 50cm in diameter, the exact function of the sun-shaped, scalloped basin is not known but it was likely made for a ruler to “glorify himself on earth and in the heavens,” says Benedict Carter, Sotheby's head of Middle East auction sales. The zodiac signs as well as planets, other symbols and calligraphic scripts feature. Such basins are very rare, Carter says, though related pieces are in museums including New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and London's British Museum. The Sotheby's basin has been in the same family home since around the 1950s.</p> <p>The auction, which will be conducted behind closed doors with online and telephone access, also includes a 16th to 17th-century silk prayer rug, with 10 different colours of dye, from the culturally rich Safavid period (£300,000-£500,000).&#xa0;</p>  <p>Lehmann Maupin now represents the in-demand Los Angeles artist Calida Rawles and will bring a selection of her work to Art Basel in Hong Kong in May. Rawles' latest pieces depict black figures under water, somewhere between floating and drowning, often on large-scale canvases. One such work was used by the author Ta-Nehisi Coates, the artist's friend and fellow rising star, for the cover of his American slavery novel, <em>The Water Dancer. </em>Rawles's latest commission is for a permanent mural at California's SoFi Stadium campus, a sports and entertainment arena due to host the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games in 2028.</p> <p>The artist will keep working with Various Small Fires gallery in LA. She says she is “very excited to be joining Lehmann Maupin alongside so many artists whose careers I've closely followed and admired”. She highlights Teresita Fernández and Do Ho Suh.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
