  "title": "Facebook Parent Meta's Earnings Fall Short as Revenue Decline Accelerates; Social-media giant posts a second consecutive revenue drop, while metaverse losses swell",
  "text": "<p>Meta shares dropped a further 11% in after-hours trading.</p><p>Meta is battling a host of challenges, including the tough macroeconomic climate, growing competition from rival TikTok and the fallout from Apple Inc.'s ad-tracking changes, all of which have taken a toll on its massive advertising business.</p><p>The company's ambitious plans to build out the metaverse also are off to a halting start.</p><p>Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is central to the company's metaverse effort, posted revenue of $285 million for the quarter, a decline of nearly 49% compared with a year ago. The unit had an operating loss of $3.7 billion as the company invests heavily in its virtual-reality and other products. Meta said it expects Reality Labs' operating losses will grow significantly next year.</p><p>\"While we face near-term challenges on revenue, the fundamentals are there for a return to stronger revenue growth,\" said Meta founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>Meta reported a net profit of $4.4 billion for the third quarter. That represents the fourth quarter in a row that the company's bottom line has fallen, something Meta hasn't experienced in a decade.</p><p>Investors are looking for any signs that Meta has begun to minimize the impact on its business of ad-tracking changes introduced by Apple last year. Meta warned in February that those changes would cost the company some $10 billion in 2022.</p><p>For the quarter, advertising came in at $27.2 billion, down nearly 4% year-over-year. Analysts predicted Meta's advertising revenue would fall to $26.9 billion. Advertising revenue represented 98.2% of the company's total revenue.</p><p>The company said it plans to invest in head count growth \"only in our highest priorities\" and shrink some of its teams. It said it had more than 87,000 employees at the end of September and anticipates staying around that level.</p><p>Meta said it expects its 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85 billion to $87 billion, down from a previous forecast of between $85 billion and $88 billion. The company said it estimates its 2023 total expenses to be between $96 billion and $101 billion.</p><p>Meta is also grappling with a digital advertising market in upheaval from surging inflation and other factors, including the war in Ukraine, that are causing a slowdown in ad spending.</p><p>\"It's tough a time to be a big social-media company right now,\" said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. \"You're facing a lot of pressures on revenue, usage and the worsening economy on top of it.\"</p><p>Fellow digital-ad giant Google on Tuesday reported its fifth consecutive quarter of slowing sales growth, with its core YouTube and search properties showing surprising weakness.</p><p>Snap Inc. reported its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth last week and warned investors that it was operating on an assumption of no revenue growth this quarter from the year-ago period.</p><p>Before Wednesday, Meta shares had fallen nearly 60% and the company had lost more than $550 billion in market value in 2022.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook on Meta? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In its efforts to combat TikTok, Meta has prioritized the development and growth of Reels, its short-form video format on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has also been focused on its building of the metaverse, and earlier this month, the company unveiled the $1,500 Meta Quest Pro, its most advanced virtual reality headset to date.</p><p>Internal company documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal, indicate that both efforts are off to rough starts.</p><p>Instagram users cumulatively are spending 17.6 million hours a day watching Reels, less than one-tenth of the 197.8 million hours TikTok users spend each day on that platform, according to one of the documents.</p><p>Meanwhile, Horizon Worlds, Meta's flagship metaverse product for consumers, has fewer than 200,000 monthly active users, far less than the company's original goal of 500,000 users by the end of this year, a goal that has been revised to 280,000, according to company documents.</p><p>One area where Meta showed promise was in adding to Facebook's massive user base, which came in at 1.98 billion daily active users. That was up from 1.97 billion three months ago.</p><p>Write to Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com</p><p>Facebook Parent Meta's Earnings Fall Short as Revenue Decline Accelerates</p>",
