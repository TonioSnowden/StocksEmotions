  "title": "World News:  China Faces Tougher Rules on European Union Deals  ----  By Tom Fairless",
  "text": "<p>   FRANKFURT -- The European Union unveiled draft rules aimed at cracking down on state-subsidized foreign companies in Europe, a move that could allow regulators to pursue big Chinese businesses in much the same way they have targeted U.S. multinationals such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. </p><p>   The legislation is the latest sign of Europe's shifting stance toward China, the bloc's biggest trading partner for goods and a crucial market for its exporters. While the new rules don't single out China, some analysts said large Chinese companies would be a primary target. </p><p>   If approved by the EU's 27 governments and the European Parliament, the rules would grant the bloc's muscular antitrust authorities new powers to block foreign companies from making acquisitions in Europe or receiving public contracts if they are deemed to have benefited from government subsidies. Companies would face stiff fines if they failed to comply with the EU's demands. </p><p>   \"Openness of the [EU's] single market is our biggest asset, but openness requires fairness,\" Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's chief competition enforcer, said at a news conference Wednesday. \"It's not fair on European workers or consumers if subsidies drive the best companies out of the market. It has to stop.\" </p><p>   The new regulation would help address rising European concerns that Chinese businesses, bolstered by state support, are competing unfairly, making rock-bottom bids at public tenders and offering unbeatable premiums for acquisitions. </p><p>   \"The problem is that China doesn't play by World Trade Organization rules. They use all the advantages but do not want the disadvantages,\" said Ulrich Ackermann, managing director for foreign trade at the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association, a trade body for a sector that employs about 1.4 million people. </p><p>   Officials at China's ministries of finance and commerce didn't respond to requests to comment. </p><p>   Under the EU's proposals, companies would be required to notify authorities of foreign subsidies they receive if they are bidding for public contracts worth at least 250 million euros, equivalent to $300 million, or planning mergers above certain thresholds. Such subsidies may include zero-interest loans, unlimited guarantees, preferential tax treatment or direct grants. </p><p>   Once notified, the EU would launch a review that could last three to six months. Regulators would be able to demand information from companies and inspect their premises, Ms. Vestager said. </p><p>   If they determine that unfair subsidies exist, they could order companies to divest themselves of assets, pay back state funds or make other commitments to address the market distortion. They also could investigate smaller deals or other foreign investments in Europe as they see fit. </p><p>   \"We will act assertively. . . . We'll have the power to order a company to pay back the subsidy,\" Ms. Vestager said. \"We'll have power to enforce [the new rules] with fines that can go up to 10% of company turnover.\" </p><p>   In China, subsidies often run deep, said Mr. Ackermann. Chinese companies may receive land free of charge from local governments, they may get cheap electricity and water, and subsidized factory buildings and machines. \"At the end you come up with a price with which Europeans can't compete,\" Mr. Ackermann said. </p><p></p>",
