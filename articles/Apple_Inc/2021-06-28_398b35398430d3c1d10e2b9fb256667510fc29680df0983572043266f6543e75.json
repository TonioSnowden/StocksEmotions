  "text": "<p>The report “Funding dispute threatens climate summit” (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5072b2be-17ed-4c20-a0e5-e631f17a8d5b\">June 19</a>) notes that rich countries have missed their target of $100bn in annual climate aid by 2020. It is important to emphasise that this shortfall is due to poor allocation rather than lack of demand. To meet their target, rich countries in the G7 and beyond must adjust their approach to capital allocation and acknowledge that, at scale, financing small and medium-sized businesses in developing economies can have a profound impact on sustainable growth and emissions reductions.</p> <p>While much of this capital will be allocated to large infrastructure projects, such as industrial solar parks, addressing the needs of SMEs should be prioritised. The global supply chains that provide citizens of G7 countries with the goods and services they consume are reliant on SMEs in developing countries. To safeguard those supply chains, and protect against future economic shocks, it is critical to finance their climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience investments.</p> <p>Seventy-eight per cent of the world's harvested croplands are in developing countries. Climate finance projects help these farmers and agribusinesses produce and process the food we consume. The cobalt and coltan mined in dangerous artisanal mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo are key ingredients for smartphones and electric vehicles. Financing green tech protects these supply chains so that consumers in developed economies can buy that latest Tesla and iPhone. And, critically, it enables safer mining practices, better health outcomes for communities and preservation of biodiversity. </p> <p><strong>Bhairav Raja</strong> <br><em>Senior Manager, DAI Sustainable Business Group, London HA5, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: SMEs in the developing world need to adapt too' FT.com 28 June.
