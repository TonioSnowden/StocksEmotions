  "text": "<p>The filmography of Justin Timberlake would look terrifying in graph form. Starting out in movies when still at the peak of his pop career, a steady ascent sped up dramatically in 2010 with a starring role in David Fincher's <em>The Social Network</em>. More recently, well — you can plot for yourself the trajectory of <em>Trolls</em>, Woody Allen clunker <em>Wonder Wheel </em>and then, unfortunately, <em>Trolls World Tour</em>. In the circumstances, you can see how prison would appeal — at least as back-story for a mournful but uplifting character study, the kind an actor can restore himself in. </p> <p>Welcome to Fisher Stevens' <em>Palmer</em>, in which Timberlake plays Eddie Palmer, like so many small-town college football stars before him destined to end up with a 12-year stretch. Naturally, we meet him as a newly ex-convict returning home to Louisiana. Palmer's intentions are good but his days aimless and nights ill-fated, at least until he finds himself de facto guardian of a gender nonconforming young neighbour. On paper the set-up risks glibness, but the execution is sweet. If you and I and everyone we know have seen the rest before, Timberlake plays it like we haven't. That much is sometimes — just about — enough. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Apple TV+ from January 29</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Justin Timberlake plays an ex-convict returning home in Palmer' FT.com 27 January.
