He instead will focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics work.</p><p>Mr. Bobb didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In an email sent this week to a group of Jewish workers at Google, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bobb apologized for the 2007 post, saying that the way he expressed his views \"were hurtful.\" He explained that he was trying to critique military action. \"None of this changes or excuses the words i [sic] wrote,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Bobb's reassignment at Google follows Apple Inc.'s ouster of a prominent advertising executive after employees circulated a letter complaining about sexist and misogynistic passages in a memoir he wrote about his time at Facebook. The executive, Antonio Garcia Martinez, accused the company of making defamatory and false statements.</p>",
