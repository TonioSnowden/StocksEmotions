  "title": "REVIEW --- Table Talk: Pumpkin Spice Lattes And the Ghosts of Meals Past --- Some flavorings have outlasted the appeal of the foods they are meant to evoke -- but not the nostalgia for eating them.",
  "text": "<p>It's easy to make fun of the faux seasonality of the pumpkin spice latte phenomenon, but there's something deep and interesting going on here. The rise of pumpkin spice shows that the dream of a particular food is now often more powerful than the food itself, particularly if you can buy the dream in a cup on the way to work. Over the eighteen years since the PSL (as it's often called) was first launched as a seasonal special by Starbucks, pumpkin spice flavoring has easily eclipsed the pies that first inspired it.</p><p>Far more Americans now drink pumpkin spice flavored coffee than ever bake a pumpkin pie at home. According to data from Nielsen, by 2018, the total pumpkin spice market in the U.S. (including everything from pumpkin spice Greek yogurt to pumpkin spice dog food) was worth more than $600 million in annual sales. Of this, only $130.6 million went for actual pumpkin pie filling.</p><p>Meanwhile, Americans spent at least $213 million on pumpkin spice flavored coffee in some form or another, including $54 million on pumpkin spice flavored coffee creamer, nearly $30 million on pumpkin spice flavored packaged coffee and $110 million on pumpkin spice lattes at Starbucks alone (not to mention all the other coffee chains that sell versions of it). One of the ironies of pumpkin spice latte is that it is now so popular you can find masses of internet recipes explaining how to make your own version at home.</p><p>The wild success of pumpkin spice as a flavor is a little odd, given that pumpkin is not even the most popular Thanksgiving pie flavor in America (in surveys of favorite pie fillings, apple consistently comes out top). Many people (though I am not one of them) despise the gummy texture and babyfood sweetness of pumpkin pie.</p><p>Starbucks executive Peter Dukes, who first came up with the concept of the pumpkin spice latte after pouring some espresso shots on a slice of pumpkin pie, has said that he had no idea whether customers would want to buy it. Yet somehow, it resonated. Whether you grew up with real pumpkin pie or not, there is something in that particular combination of spice -- along with the Harry Potter comfort of the word \"pumpkin\" -- that triggers nostalgic ideas of home.</p><p>Our food supply is full of flavorings that are based on earlier ways of eating. I think of these industrial flavors as the ghosts of meals past. Consider sour cream and onion. I can't remember the last time anyone offered me a dish of sour cream and onion dip, which used to be such a staple of buffets, served with chips or crudites of raw vegetables. With the inexorable rise of hummus, sour cream and onion is a dip that has almost completely passed out of favor. Yet sour-cream-and-onion-flavored chips continue to reign supreme. I sometimes wonder how many of the young people who eat sour cream and onion snacks even know that they were originally based on the dip.</p><p>In Britain, where I live, there is a whole spectrum of potato chip flavors based on the hearty meals beloved of an earlier generation. There are prawn cocktail chips and roast beef and onion chips and ham and mustard chips. In other countries, the flavors are different. I was fascinated to discover that in Ukraine, the salty snack flavors for sale include red caviar, veal, crab, aspic-and-horseradish and \"hunting sausage.\"</p><p>Some of the most extreme examples of processed foods flavored to taste like traditional foods come from Japan, where Kit Kat flavors include a bright yellow version that tastes of grilled corn. In Japan, you can apparently also buy popsicles designed to taste like spaghetti with tomato sauce.</p><p>We are far from the first generation to have created fake versions of foods to take the place of ingredients that were too rare or costly for everyday use. In 18th-century England, turtle soup was a prestige food, made from green turtles imported from the West Indies. But over time, turtles were hunted almost to the point of extinction, and mock turtle soup was created as an affordable alternative.</p><p>This thick brown soup was made from a calf's head boiled in broth with Madeira wine, herbs and onions. Mock turtle soup gave the Victorians who ate it the illusion that they were living the high life. Over time -- as with pumpkin spice lattes -- mock turtle soup became more popular than the food that inspired it. It was even sold in cans by Heinz.</p><p>The difference is that whereas mock turtle soup was still a soup, a pumpkin spice latte has nothing in common with the original pumpkin pie, except for the smell and the taste. Until 2015, when they tweaked the formula, the Starbucks latte didn't even include any pumpkin. I'm not sure which is stranger: a cup of coffee that pretends to be made of pumpkin but isn't or a cup of coffee that does contain pumpkin.</p><p>It sometimes seems as if we live in a world of pumpkin spice everywhere yet not a drop to eat. I would happily forgo all of the flavored lattes for one slice of real pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving dinner with my sister and her children (OK, three slices). The recipe I am making this year is the Buttermilk Bourbon Pumpkin Pie in \"Pie Camp\" by Kate McDermott, the greatest pie cookbook I've come across. McDermott's pastry instructions are genuinely foolproof, and you end up with the flakiest crust. (For other buttermilk pie recipes, see page D9.)</p><p>Along with the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves, this glorious pie contains tangy buttermilk and a nip of bourbon whiskey. When it's baking, the kitchen fills with a warm spicy scent that reminds you of something. It's a little like a pumpkin spice latte. But real.</p>",
