  "text": "<p>Not so long ago—2010, to be precise—Hollywood was enjoying a record financial year. Over 90% of U.S. households paid an average of $74 a month for what at the time was the dominant American entertainment product: the cable-TV bundle. The bundle brought in over $93 billion in subscription revenues, which was divided between distribution companies and entertainment companies. Advertising revenues from the bundle contributed an additional $60 billion.</p><p>There were other vibrant financial springs that year: Customers spent $19 billion to own or rent physical copies (on DVD and Blu-ray) of their favorite movies and series. And thanks to increased ticket prices, movie-theater revenues reached $10.4 billion, up to that point the second highest year on record. From a financial perspective, it was a good time to be in the storytelling business.</p><p>Act Two</p><p>Things changed as a result of the wide availability of broadband in the home, Roku set-top boxes in the living room, high-speed wireless, and the rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets.</p><p>For tens of millions of consumers, time spent watching broadcast or cable television increasingly shifted toward streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. In the U.S., streaming services eventually eclipsed the amount of television consumed on all broadcast networks, and eclipsed the amount of television consumed on all cable channels. YouTube and TikTok also became widespread new habits, serving short form videos digitally.</p><p>These changes in consumer behavior might seem subtle to many, but they are behind one of the most consequential and anxiety-ridden years in Hollywood history. In 2022, Hollywood's streaming subscribers, revenues and consumption have continued to rise, with the so-called streaming wars in full swing. It is still relatively early in the emergence of streaming, but the level of investment in original content required to field a leading premium video streaming service already exceeds $10 billion a year. And while consumers continue to enjoy an unprecedented level of choice and value in premium series, movies and documentaries, all of the major streamers inception-to-date have negative operating cash flows.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Are you juggling different streaming services? Have you cut the cord or do you still have a cable subscription? How did you make these decisions, and how often do you update your viewing options? Join the conversation below.</p><p>At the same time, the percentage of American households that subscribe to the cable-TV bundle has fallen from a high of 90% in 2010 to 55% this past quarter. As revenues from cable TV are now declining year over year, licensing fees for top-tier live sports have tripled since 2010. The cost of producing scripted and unscripted television series has gone up as well: What was $6 million for an episode of \"Game of Thrones\" in 2010 is now an estimated $30 million for an episode of \"Stranger Things\" in 2022. At the cinemas, domestic movie ticket revenue for 2022 is expected to be 35% lower than the prepandemic levels of 2019.</p><p>With the above as context, perhaps it is not surprising that, at the time of this writing, the stock prices of the leading entertainment companies are all down considerably from this time last year.</p><p>Act 3</p><p>Where is Hollywood likely to go from here? With the William Goldman caveat clearly stated that no one knows anything, here is my take on what to expect in the coming years.</p><p>Despite the chaotic nature of the current moment, a reassuring worldwide constant in the decades to come will be our collective need for well-told stories. I believe that Hollywood will continue to serve this fundamental human need, but doing so in a sustainable manner is going to first require dramatic change.</p><p>There will be multiple business casualties in the paid streaming wars and a few business victors. Digital markets for industries that have high fixed costs and relatively low variable costs have tended toward a few, unusually large winners, and I believe such will be the case in entertainment. In this scenario, no more than three global entertainment companies are likely to attain the streaming-service scale required—300 million global subscriptions at an average of $15 per month—to generate attractive cash flows. (Amazon and Apple, both purveyors of streaming, will be in addition and measured differently.)</p><p>Expect two or three major mergers and/or acquisitions involving entertainment companies in the coming 24 months as a result. Given the unusually large addressable market and the relatively fixed cost of content at scale, I believe the streaming cash flows of the leading companies will eventually be north of $10 billion a year, far greater than what most entertainment companies have each historically generated. For a precious few, the considerable investment will be well worth it. Some of the most telling signs of progress will be revealed by a clearly articulated path to compelling cash flows and strong performance on key metrics like average revenue per user, engagement, subscriber acquisition costs, churn and the number of fully owned customer relationships.</p><p>It won't all be about paid streaming, of course, as consumers have diverse needs when it comes to their entertainment. Those companies with a well-defined vision to delight audiences across a variety of channels—married with stellar creative partnerships and wise allocation of capital—will have the advantage. As for the cable bundle, it will become synonymous with the landline: clear decline and surprising longevity.</p><p>Sports leagues have the opportunity to increase their audiences by avoiding channel exclusivity and insisting on dual distribution of each game across the cable bundle and streaming. Expect a more aggressive focus across the globe toward free ad-supported models delivered over the internet. There will also be continued evolution at the cineplex, as theaters seek to strongly differentiate a great night out at the movies from an evening on the couch. IMAX and Alamo Drafthouse serve as inspiration, demonstrating cinema's power to elevate films and their impact on us.</p><p>In addition to films, there is a substantive opportunity to enhance the presentation and communal experience of the most ambitious series by leaning into the theatrical environment. Imagine each episode of \"House of the Dragon\" exclusively projected on silver screens globally on a Saturday before streaming on a Sunday. It would also not be surprising if the length of a movie's exclusive theatrical window becomes based on consumer demand for the theatrical experience rather than anything else (e.g., a movie's exclusive run in U.S. theaters would remain in place for as long as its weekly box office stayed above $5 million). </p><p>A gift shop at Disney World in Florida. Disney developed the strategy of cultivating relationships with fans in a variety of ways, something that can become more personalized in a digital world. PHOTO: Zack Wittman for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>One of the most exciting prospects of the leading entertainment companies in the next century will be the ability to superserve fans in ever more differentiated and personalized ways digitally. Walt Disney was the original visionary of this strategy, offering fans of Mickey Mouse everything from a one-size-fits-all theatrical experience to consumer products, television and a magical visit to Disneyland. Those entertainment companies that earn robust, authentic digital relationships with customers have the chance to deliver profoundly positive experiences and financially meaningful results. These experiences are likely to include digital theme parks (how fun would it be for kids to claim their dorm rooms at Hogwarts?), socially fulfilling videogames, digital goods and epic, live digital events that speak to the biggest of fans.</p><p>While 2022 may initially enter the Hollywood financial history books as the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year, a more accurate interpretation over time could be that we are simply witnessing a beloved industry in the most critical moments of a high-stakes transition from one century of growth into the next. One thing is for certain: It has all the ingredients for a great story.</p><p>Mr. Kilar is the former CEO of WarnerMedia, and the founding CEO of Hulu.
