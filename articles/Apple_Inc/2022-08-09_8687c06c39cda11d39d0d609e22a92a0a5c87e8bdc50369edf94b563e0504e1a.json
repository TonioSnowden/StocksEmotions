  "title": "'Five Days at Memorial' Review: In Katrina's Wake; Based on Sheri Fink's book by the same name, this miniseries stars Vera Farmiga as a doctor forced to make impossible choices in the deadly chaos following the hurricane in New Orleans.",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>The series is, in fact, an often-grueling exercise in reconstructed chaos, squalor, bureaucratic buck-passing and political malfunction. Scapegoating—in multiple directions—is a major theme of the piece, based on Sheri Fink's book of the same name, and its conclusions: When the hellacious storm and resulting crises at Baptist Memorial Hospital in New Orleans have ebbed, and 45 corpses are found in the squalor, the prosecutions begin, with doctors accused of the \"mercy killings\" of several patients in various states of distress. Were the accused guilty? Were they guilty even if they were guilty?</p><p>There's a lot to get through before the charges start flying, but the introductory depositions are a clear indication of where we're going—straight into a natural disaster and a national disgrace.</p><p>The principal defendant—and the series' principal character—is Dr. Anna Pou (Vera Farmiga), who arrives at Memorial on the eve of the storm and spearheads the treatment of the patients there and at the adjoining LifeCare, a private acute-care facility that leases upstairs space from Memorial. In the show's sweeping assessment of innocence and incompetence, LifeCare is just one managerially abused hospital. As Memorial's \"incident commander\" Susan Mulderick (a terrific Cherry Jones) will discover, the facility has no contingency plan for a massive flood. (Seldom have maintenance workers been portrayed so heroically.) Memorial's owner, Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare, is portrayed as having left its patients to drown. (It later settled a class-action lawsuit for $25 million.) FEMA is MIA. The Coast Guard and National Guard are directionless. At one point, the helicopters plucking patients off the Memorial roof have to clear the air space so President George W. Bush can make his notorious \"fly-by.\"</p><p>There's no mistaking where the villainy lies in \"Five Days at Memorial.\" It's everywhere. And you hardly have to guess the series' sentiments, particularly when a lingering moment is devoted to a nurse flipping off Air Force One. It's silly, but just one of many moments in the series that hit you in the head like an empty bedpan. Executive produced and written by Carlton Cuse (\"Lost\") and John Ridley (an Oscar winner for \"12 Years a Slave\"), the series is directed by Messrs. Cuse and Ridley and Wendey Stanzler, who seem to have instructed their actors to get out on the emotional ledge and perform as earnestly and emphatically as possible, lest the filth, decay and special effects—which are certainly impressive, especially when the levees break—haven't convinced us how dire the situation is.</p><p>Ms. Farmiga is always good, but several of the cast, given banal and obvious things to say, can be as wearying as the deluge of emergencies beleaguering the hospital, not all of them caused by the hurricane itself. Dr. Horace Baltz (Robert Pine) is unendingly sanctimonious; Dr. Bryant King (Cornelius Smith Jr.) is burdened with providing most of the black perspective we don't get from the copious news footage showing even less fortunate inhabitants of New Orleans slogging through the floodwaters, children and possessions in tow. We get it. When Dr. Pou's husband visits the hospital, the two act like lovesick teenagers. We get it. Molly Hager and Michael Gaston, as the investigators probing the Memorial deaths, have a thankless job and make their characters' righteous indignation plausible dramatically, if not quite emotionally. We get it. But they take a while to get up to speed.</p><p>What's genuinely impressive—and even instructive—are the computer-generated visuals, which give a convincing sense of what 15 feet of water must have looked like as it rushed into a low-lying place like New Orleans. Or what kind of a liability glass construction can be when trees are flying through the air. Or what happens to a causeway between hospital buildings when a category 5 hurricane hits it at 175 miles an hour. It also draws very definite conclusions about legal culpability at Memorial, while leaving morality twisting in the wind.</p><p>'Five Days at Memorial' Review: In Katrina's Wake</p>",
