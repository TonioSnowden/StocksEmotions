  "text": "<p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Credit Suisse gets a new CEO&#xa0;&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Big Oil's mega-deal hiatus</p></li>  <li><p>A reckoning comes to Wall Street</p></li> </ul> <h1>Credit Suisse opts for open heart surgery</h1> <p>It isn't the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47471301-2898-4144-9882-475dcf4030ab\">“clean slate”</a> <strong>Thomas Gottstein</strong> had hoped to achieve at <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>.</p> <p>An avid skier, the Swiss executive was always in over his head after being brought in to replace <strong>Tidjane Thiam</strong>. The task of reviving the scandal-prone bank now falls to <strong>Ulrich Körner</strong>, who was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4aeec6d7-8541-4702-a7d9-d66e58cdead2\">named its new chief yesterday</a>.</p> <p>Körner returned to Credit Suisse from <strong>UBS</strong> in 2021 to repair its damaged asset management division after his predecessor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a730fa1f-c8e1-4f41-a3d8-2825ff242bb0\">got caught</a> in<strong> Lex Greensill</strong>'s web of supply-chain finance funds. He must now find a way to turn round the entire bank. </p> <p>Credit Suisse's board is hoping Körner, who earned the nickname “Uli the knife” during the 11 years he spent at its domestic rival, will live up to his cost-cutting reputation.</p> <p>The decision to anoint Körner, a wealth management executive and not an investment banker, makes the path ahead clear.</p> <p>The 59-year-old Swiss executive beat out two internal rivals — investment banking boss <strong>Christian</strong> <strong>Meissner</strong> and wealth management head <strong>Francesco</strong> <strong>De Ferrari </strong>— because of his reputation as a cost-cutter at UBS, people familiar with the matter told the FT. Meissner will depart soon.</p> <p>Körner's appointment, which was formalised as the bank reported a third consecutive lossmaking quarter on Wednesday, comes with a mandate to slash costs and pare back its investment bank.</p> <p>Equally important will be ending the lender's reputation for taking outsized risks.</p> <p>“Credit Suisse has always been too small to compete with Wall Street, so we have taken risks that are too great,” said a Credit Suisse compliance professional, citing last year's twin crises of <strong>Greensill Capital</strong> and <strong>Archegos</strong>.</p> <p>“Some of them pay off for a while. But it is like Russian roulette — the sixth bullet always kills you.”</p> <p>Körner has no silver bullets. He must embark on a brutal cost-cutting exercise that will strip out as much as 20 per cent of the bank's annual spending, leaving it at less than SFr15.5bn.</p> <p>He was narrowly beaten in 2011 by <strong>Sergio</strong> <strong>Ermotti</strong> for UBS's top job. Körner, nonetheless, can draw on his work in that turnround as the lender recovered from a rogue trading scandal.</p> <p>Working under Ermotti, Körner saw first-hand the benefit of trading investment banking revenues for those in asset management, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9e8214a-ecce-4320-95d1-bdb64d75b809\">Lex points out</a>. Ermotti cut UBS's investment bank down to size, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/174927a9-84b3-49a1-86d6-98fcbaab537e\">ruffling feathers</a> along the way. Körner should expect a similar conflict. </p> <p>The changes he will enact come after the board spent significant time developing a new strategy with its adviser, <strong>Centerview</strong> <strong>Partners</strong>.</p> <p>The real challenge at hand is to undo decades of drift. Some trace Credit Suisse's problems to its attempt to break into Wall Street by building a stake in <strong>First</strong> <strong>Boston</strong> in 1988, branching out from its Swiss private banking roots. </p> <p>“Twenty years ago we lost our soul,” said one veteran wealth manager, who lamented a succession of investment banking chief executives such as <strong>John</strong> <strong>Mack</strong> and <strong>Brady</strong> <strong>Dougan</strong>. “Banana trees are not going to produce cherries,” they added.</p> <h1>The oil and gas bosses steering clear of megadeals&#xa0;</h1> <p>At a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47c9ec9f-e86e-427e-8a50-34e4a6757852\">difficult moment</a> for dealmaking, one spot where bankers might reasonably hope for blockbuster M&amp;A is the oil and gas industry. </p> <p>Supermajors are generating more money than ever and spending relatively little of it. They've pledged to become green businesses. </p> <p>And since their share prices have largely recovered from coronavirus pandemic-era lows and the valuations of some renewable players have gone in the opposite direction, a green energy mega-deal seems, at least on paper, to make sense.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong>, <strong>Shell</strong> and <strong>TotalEnergies</strong> have begun to snap up small renewable energy players. But the $1bn to $3bn deals that have been done are tiny compared with the tens of billions that would be needed to transform their businesses.</p> <p>And as the FT wrote last week, Shell chief executive <strong>Ben van Beurden </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe3247bf-8868-49fb-9b7d-5869f59e2bef\">has been holding back</a>. </p> <p>He's not alone, it turns out. Total's <strong>Patrick Pouyanné</strong>, who has been the most acquisitive oil CEO in the green energy space and who tends to shun bankers, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/760ba17c-3437-45eb-841a-e5980bf3ae22\">told the FT's Tom Wilson</a> that the challenge remains proving that renewables can deliver sufficient returns.</p> <p>“Our DNA is that we love the volatility of raw materials of petrol, of gas . . . we know there can be low points but there are high points too,” he said. “A utility isn't that, these are people that accept a return level that is regulated and controlled.”</p> <p>So if companies such as Total decide to buy renewable energy businesses, they may look for those where at least some portion of the power produced is not subject to regulated tariffs.</p> <p>Another hurdle: despite the shift in relative valuations, renewables businesses are still trading at much higher multiples.</p> <p>So while there are fewer arguments against an oil major taking over a renewable giant these days, blockbuster deals might be a little way off.</p> <h1>The Wall Street purge begins</h1> <p>Investment bankers summering in the Hamptons ought to look over their shoulders before indulging in a leisurely lunch.</p> <p>You wouldn't want your boss, say, <strong>David Solomon</strong>, catching you slacking off now that the golden days of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36f1c72a-f63f-4404-87ab-dfbeb335cbd3\">juicy bonuses</a> and “work/life balance” are slipping away just as fast as the Spac boom did.</p> <p>“The power has shifted from the employee to the employer,” Mike Mayo, the prominent bank analyst at Wells Fargo, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f1aa4c6-7aee-4d19-b13d-aa469a6ada06\">told DD's James Fontanella-Khan</a>, as recession fears force executives to tighten the purse strings. </p> <p>Junior employees, who'd just begun to seize some bargaining power as they carried out the grunt work on an endless assembly line of deals, best get back to their pitch decks to make sure everything is in the right font.</p> <p>Radical cost-cutting will be inevitable, finance executives told DD, given the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bdef7a6-69f1-4f42-b27d-74dd34db4804\">exorbitant spending</a> in Wall Street's war for talent last year.</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>— the last of the big US investment banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b33f3645-ff93-4309-a575-f92641faaa43\">to raise junior salaries</a> in response to complaints about burnout during the dealmaking frenzy — has now become one of the first lenders to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c0c341f-6a02-4996-9b6c-e927e69273ea\">start firing</a> underperforming staff.</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, <strong>Citigroup</strong> and<strong> Bank of America</strong> are taking similar measures to facilitate lay-offs. </p> <p>First on the chopping block could be equity capital market bankers, particularly the ones who worked on Spacs, followed by debt financing bankers as fewer deals are being executed. M&amp;A bankers might be able to hold on to their jobs for longer, but they're also at risk. </p> <p>“This is one of the biggest conundrums for Wall Street CEOs,” said Mayo. “Cut too deep and you have to pay up after to get them back while you play catch-up. The other risk is you don't take the needed moves and you're stuck with bloated overhead.”&#xa0;</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>DD exclusive</strong>: <strong>Paul Achleitner</strong>, who stepped down earlier this year as chair of <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> after a decade, has joined the advisory board of <strong>Hakluyt</strong>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>M&amp;G</strong>'s investment chief <strong>Jack Daniels</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6027f843-b0ee-4cb3-94fc-2e353a04995b\">is leaving the company</a> after more than two decades, amid a changing of the guard at the savings and investment group.</p></li>  <li><p>Former <strong>Kingfisher </strong>chief <strong>Véronique Laury</strong> is joining the board of <strong>British American Tobacco</strong> as a director from September 2022.
