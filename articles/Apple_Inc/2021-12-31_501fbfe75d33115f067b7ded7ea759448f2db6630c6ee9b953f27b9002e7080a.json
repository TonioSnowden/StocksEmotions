  "text": "<p>Money managers described Friday's trading activity as light, and chalked up the marginal selling to last-minute tax moves and year-end portfolio positioning by fund managers. \"Today is more about April than it is about Dec. 31,\" said Jason Brady, chief executive of Thornburg Investment Management, which manages nearly $50 billion in assets.</p><p>The relatively calm trading Friday juxtaposed a busy year in markets in which individual investors piled into meme stocks and the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and low interest rates motivated investments in equities.</p><p>These factors helped the S&amp;P 500 to close at a record 70 times this year, more than one-quarter of all trading days, according to Dow Jones Market Data, and pushed the index up 27% in 2021. The Dow and Nasdaq did well over the past 12 months too, rising 19% and 21%, respectively, handing all three benchmarks their best three-year performance since 1999.</p><p>Much of the broader market rally was also driven by a small group of massive stocks, such as Apple, Tesla and Microsoft. Microsoft and Tesla shares have each risen around 50% this year, while Apple has gained more than 30%.</p><p>\"This is really the year of the economic recovery,\" said Sean Markowicz, an investment strategist at Schroders. \"In 2022, I see growth cooling as the massive policy stimulus in response to the pandemic fades.\"</p><p>Investors are watching a number of risks heading into 2022 that could derail the market's rally. Cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 are surging, causing some businesses to curtail services and hours as workers call in sick. U.S. inflation reached a nearly four-decade high last month, raising questions about how many price increases Americans can absorb and if that will affect corporate earnings. The Federal Reserve has also set the stage for a series of interest-rate increases beginning next spring.</p><p>In response to some of those concerns, investors turned more defensive over December. They bought shares of utilities, consumer staples, and real-estate firms, pushing all three sectors up at least 9.4% over the month. Technology and communication stocks saw more muted gains, while shares of consumer discretionary firms were flat.</p><p>That continued to play out on Friday. Stocks across the communication services sector slipped 1.2%. Facebook parent company Meta Platforms fell $8.01, or 2.3%, to $336.35, while Alphabet lost $26.97, or 0.9%, to $2,897.04 and Netflix retreated $9.65, or 1.6%, to $602.44.</p><p>Some meme stocks were also in the red, suggesting some investors took profits there, too. Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings fell $1.74, or 6%, to $27.20 Friday after rising more than tenfold this year. GameStop, up nearly 700% for the year, declined $6.94 on Friday, or 4.5%, to $148.39.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of vaccine makers climbed. Pfizer added 65 cents, or 1.1%, to $59.05 in the wake of the the U.K.'s drug regulator authorizing its Covid-19 oral antiviral pill, as well as signs that public health officials in the U.S. may approve booster shots against the virus for 12- to 15-year olds as early as next week. Moderna climbed $2.38, or 0.9%, to $253.98.</p><p>Shares of Ford Motor also topped the S&amp;P 500, adding 30 cents, or 1.5%, to $20.77. The car maker's stock, which has been a favorite among retail investors all year, more than doubled this year, its biggest annual gain since 2009.</p><p>Consumer staples added 0.7%, while utilities and real-estate firms rose 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ended at 1.496%, rising 0.583 percentage point this year, the largest one-year yield gain since 2013. Investors have sold out of government bonds, pushing up yields, because holding bonds that yield less than inflation means locking in a loss. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged almost 0.2% lower, with markets closed in Germany, Spain and Italy. The broad-market index has risen more than 20% this year.</p><p>The rapidly spreading Omicron variant is clouding the outlook for oil markets after a rapid recovery in demand pushed prices to their highest levels in years. Brent crude futures, the benchmark in global oil markets, declined 2.2% Friday to $77.78. For the year, it is up 50%.</p><p>Shares of Chinese internet and technology companies jumped in Hong Kong on the last day of the year, following a surge in their corresponding American depositary receipts overnight. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the 30 largest technology companies listed in the city, rose 3.6% on Friday in a holiday-shortened trading session. The broader Hang Seng Index gained 1.2%.</p><p>China's Shanghai Composite added 0.6% Friday. Markets in South Korea and Japan were closed for a holiday.</p><p>U.S. Stocks Slip to Close Out Banner Year</p>",
