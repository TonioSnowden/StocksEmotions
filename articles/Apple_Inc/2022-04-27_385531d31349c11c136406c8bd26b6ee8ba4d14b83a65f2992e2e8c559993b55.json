Facebook executives have cited inflation, supply-chain issues, the war in Ukraine, European economic headwinds, increased competition from services such as TikTok and changes Apple Inc. AAPL made to its mobile operating system that make it more difficult for apps to track consumers in ads.</p><p>For more: Meta CFO cries 'wolf' again with bleak Facebook outlook â€” but he may be right this time</p><p>In a white paper published by Apple on Tuesday, Kinshuk Jerath, a professor of business in the marketing division at Columbia Business School, concluded it would be speculative to claim billions of advertising dollars moved from companies like Meta to Apple because of Apple's move.</p><p>\"This outlook reflects a continuation of the trends impacting revenue growth in the first quarter, including softness in the back half of the first quarter that coincided with the war in Ukraine,\" Meta Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in a statementannouncing the results. \"Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be approximately a 3% headwind to year-over-year growth in the second quarter, based on current exchange rates.\"</p><p>In the webcast presentation, Zuckerberg acknowledged the impact of TikTok and Apple, but said Meta was confident in its Reels short-form videos and artificial intelligence to address each company, respectively.</p><p>The mixed results arrive on the heels of lighter-than-expected sales and earnings from Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG on Tuesday, deepening concerns that companies dependent on advertising may face a rough patch with a war raging in Ukraine and inflation burning through the pocketbooks of consumers.

PINS shares also soared after earnings on Wednesday.</p><p>Daily active users, or DAUs, a crucial metric for Meta's growth globally, increased 4% to 1.96 billion, topping analyst expectations of 1.95 billion. The uptick largely allayed investors, who have openly fret over decreased user engagement on Facebook's platforms.</p><p>\"The growth in (DAUs) is a good sign for Facebook, especially coming off of Q4 2021 when it experienced its first-ever decline in DAUs. But it's also clear that Facebook is still struggling to bring in new users, and it's becoming increasingly difficult for Instagram to pick up the slack,\" said Evelyn Mitchell, an analyst at Insider Intelligence. \"Most of the growth in both [monthly active users] and DAUs in Q1 came from the rest of the world, not the US and Canada, which monetizes at a better rate.\"</p><p>Read more: These 21 large-cap stocks have now crashed at least 50%</p><p>Meta's stock has been among the worst in tech this year, plummeting 48% so far, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index SPX has dipped 12% in 2022.</p><p>Facebook earnings beat sends Meta stock soaring, but sales hit slowest growth in a decade</p>",
