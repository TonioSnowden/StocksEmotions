  "text": "<p>It is often said that we live in a disposable era, where devices have built-in obsolescence, and it is often simpler to buy a new item rather than get it repaired. Even so, it has come as something of a shock to find that this principle even applies to prime ministers.</p> <p>The UK is now enjoying, if that is the word, its fourth premier in six years (its third in three). This is iPhone levels of disposability although when you replace a mobile it is normally in the expectation of an upgrade. </p> <p>But Britain has been downgrading its leaders so relentlessly that if they were phones we'd soon be back to a device with no internet access and where the only game was <em>Snake</em>.</p> <p>Since the 1970s, only Thatcher and Blair have been an unarguable step up from their predecessor. And even Major now looks like a bit of a classic device compared with what followed. It remains to be seen whether <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/1efb5130-4146-4deb-a8c9-5d9d85fad73a\">Liz Truss</a> offers an upward surge, but what statisticians call the trend line is unmistakably down. </p> <p>Some of these deposed PMs are so new, they're still covered by the warranty. This perhaps explains the rush to exchange. “I got this prime minister here 18 months ago but it doesn't work any more. What do you mean that the defects were well known in advance and I have to wait till the election? I want a new leader now, preferably one chosen by 140,000 people I've never met.”</p> <p>The turnover is remarkable. It is true that 1963-64 delivered three prime ministers but the first and last of the trio (Macmillan and Wilson) ruled for 15 years between them on either side of that period. </p> <p>Now leaders are turfed out by their own side for the lure of a new model with improved electoral features like purer conservatism, not breaking the law and being even more beastly to the Europeans.</p> <p>Not since Blair has a prime minister secured the job through the tiresome business of first winning an outright parliamentary majority in an election. Five of our past seven premiers got the job without first going before the voters.</p> <p>Perhaps a more accurate analogy than an iPhone would be a football manager, not least because of the often absurd expectations that fans have of the change. As with managers, you don't wait around for defeat. The thing you have to understand, Gary, is that prime ministers are in the results business. You have to take action the moment you see your team heading in the wrong direction. And political history shows there can be enough of a temporary bounce to avoid the drop.</p> <p>It would, though, be enjoyable to see political leaders interviewed as if they were football managers. </p> <p>“Well, Gary, to be honest we were undone by some very poor refereeing decisions. I mean, when did having a slice of birthday cake or a small informal drinks party become a criminal offence?”</p> <p>“Wasn't it when you legislated to that effect?”</p> <p>“That's it, this interview is over.” </p> <p>It's no good arguing that this is just one poor set of local elections. Once the fans turn on you, it's over. You're getting sacked in the morning. And it isn't even enough to keep winning, you've got to play the right kind of politics. Tories want to see displays of total conservatism with rightwingers bursting down the touchline with deregulatory initiatives to maximise the opportunities of Brexit. Labour fans also want to see a settled socialist squad bombing down the leftwing playing state possession of all the major utilities.</p> <p>And if it's not football managers or iPhones, maybe it's a reality TV model. After all, if I can vote someone off <em>Love Island</em> or <em>Strictly . . .</em> every week, why should I have to wait five years for a new prime minister?</p> <p>This matters because the more leaders are worrying about being toppled in the near future, the less likely they are to take the difficult decisions or undertake necessary reforms that won't benefit them.</p> <p>But this is where we are. There's always a better team, a fitter contestant, a smarter phone and a fresher leader if we just reach out and grab them. This is the end state of political consumerism and we're here because we're worth it. </p> <p><em>Follow Robert on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertshrimsley\"><em>@robertshrimsley</em></a><em> and email him at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=robert.shrimsley@ft.com\"><em>robert.shrimsley@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be560c32-7ebe-4612-8f7b-360384690144\"><em>One thing of consequence from the Johnson years</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be560c32-7ebe-4612-8f7b-360384690144\"><em>From Richard Moon, Beirut, Lebanon</em></a></p><p>Source: Robert Shrimsley 2022 'In a disposable world, prime ministers are like iPhones' FT.com 9 September.
