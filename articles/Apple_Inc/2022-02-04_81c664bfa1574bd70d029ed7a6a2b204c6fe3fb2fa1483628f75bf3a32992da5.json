  "text": "<p>Alexandra Heal's excellent article about wireless earbuds sounded a loud and clear warning about the growing menace of e-waste (“Après moi . . .”, <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/fixing-my-broken-wireless-earbuds/\">Magazine</a>, FT Weekend, January 22), in particular, of the nano variety. I shall all the more fiercely cherish my large, over-ear, wired headphones, already in their 15th year. I was dismayed, though, to see her succumb to the fashionable use of the word “ecosystem” as a synonym for “system”, when she writes of Apple's “ever-growing ecosystem of gadgets”. </p> <p>It is not her intention to suggest that Apple's version of these gadgets is somehow “greener” and environmentally better than others — quite the contrary, of course — but that is the connotation of “ecosystem”. </p> <p>Such collocations as “industrial ecosystem” and “production ecosystem” are not just oxymorons: they are disingenuous, even deceitful, given the harm caused by industry and production to the natural environment, the real “ecosystem”. </p> <p>Soon, if this trend is not checked, the word will be so degraded that, to refer to the actual ecosystem, we will have to use the tautology “environmental ecosystem”.</p> <p><strong>Christopher English</strong><br><em>Cushendall, County Antrim, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: An industrial ‘ecosystem' is nothing of the sort' FT.com 4 February.
