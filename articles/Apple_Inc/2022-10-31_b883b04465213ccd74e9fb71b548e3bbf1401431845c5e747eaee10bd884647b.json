  "title": "U.S. Stocks Fall With Focus on Fed; Central-bank officials are expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point Wednesday",
  "text": "<p>The Fed's rapid interest-rate increases have battered markets for much of the year, leaving some investors searching for even the faintest sign that it is time to put their money to work again.</p><p>In October, traders were encouraged when some Fed officials said they are considering whether to slow the pace of monetary tightening as they balance controlling inflation and avoiding a sharp economic contraction. The European Central Bank also cited concerns that additional rate hikes could hurt the outlook for growth.</p><p>October's stock rally came despite falling government-bond prices and rising yields, which for much of the year had slammed stocks. Monday's gain sealed the 10-year Treasury yield's climb to 4.074%, from 3.802% at the end of September. Yields and bond prices move inversely.</p><p>That pattern suggests some investors were thinking wishfully when bidding up stock prices in October, said Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research. \"I think it was largely a hope trade,\" he said. \"I don't think it was built upon fundamentals.\"</p><p>This week, traders are shuffling their holdings ahead of Wednesday, when Fed officials are almost certain to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point. On Monday, the S&amp;P declined 29.08 points, or 0.7%, to 3871.98 and the tech-focused Nasdaq shed 114.31, or 1%, to 10988.15. The Dow dropped 128.85, or 0.4%, to 32732.95.</p><p>The focus will be on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference, which could bring clues about whether the Fed may reduce the size of future rate increases, or continue strong efforts to tame rising prices.</p><p>Specifically, investors want to know if December will mean yet another 0.75-percentage-point rate increase, or whether the Fed will downshift to a half-percentage-point move. Bets in futures markets show that traders see roughly even odds of either outcome, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"I'm anticipating hearing Powell walking a fine line, trying to point out some of the positive data without the market taking it as a full-blown pivot,\" Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said of his expectations for Mr. Powell's remarks Wednesday.</p><p>Whatever the size of December's move, economists caution that high inflation—still at an 8.2% annual rate in September—will keep the Fed on track to bring rates up well into next year. Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their estimate of how high the Fed's target interest rate will eventually climb. The bank now expects the Fed's target to reach 4.75% to 5% next year, up from the Fed's current range of 3% to 3.25%.</p><p>Investors are also poring over third-quarter earnings, which have helped boost some companies whose reports showed resilience in a turbulent economy. Some large tech companies such as Microsoft, on the other hand, have seen selloffs after posting lackluster results. This week, nearly a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies are posting their latest figures.</p><p>Tech stocks helped drag down stock indexes on Monday. Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, lost $6.04, or 6.1%, to $93.16, continuing last week's slide that followed a disappointing earnings report. Apple shares fell $2.40, or 1.5%, to $153.34 as Foxconn, an important contributor to Apple's iPhone production, struggled with a Covid-19 outbreak at a factory in China.</p><p>With more rate rises on the horizon, it is difficult to take much comfort in the stock market's October rally, said Paul Eitelman, chief investment strategist for North America at Russell Investments. Russell has avoided buying into stock-market dips this year, cautious about how an economic downturn could bring further losses.</p><p>\"I think there's still critical issues that we need to get through as global equities investors in the months ahead,\" Mr. Eitelman said. \"Until the labor market slows down, U.S. monetary policy is going to be a headwind for markets going forward.\"</p><p>Chicago wheat futures rose 6.4% to $8.82 a bushel after Russia said it would suspend participation in the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports. If shipments of Ukrainian grain are halted, the suspension will likely drive up the global price of wheat, corn and other vital food products. Corn rose 1.6% to $6.20 a bushel.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell 94 cents a barrel, or 1%, to $94.83. Overall, oil climbed 7.8% in October, the first month of price gains since May.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 was up about 0.3% Monday, contributing to a 6.3% rise in October.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed with mixed performances. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.8% and South Korea's Kospi added 1.1%. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.2% and China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.8%.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Fall With Focus on Fed</p>",
