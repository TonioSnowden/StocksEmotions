  "text": "<p>Cybersecurity group Darktrace lifted revenue guidance for the second time in as many months after its maiden full-year results beat expectations.</p> <p>The Mike Lynch-backed company, whose shares have more than doubled since flotation on the London Stock Exchange in April, said it expects revenue growth of between 35 per cent and 37 per cent this year, up from its previous forecast of 29 per cent to 32 per cent.</p> <p>Sales trends including a “particularly strong” June performance meant recent trading was towards the upper end of its expectations, Darktrace said. But the company also flagged potential disruption starting from the fiscal second quarter of 2022 as it begins to expand its sales force. </p> <p>Revenue for the year ended June grew 41.3 per cent to $281m and its operating loss widened to $38.5m from $24.9m the year before, Darktrace reported.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Housebuilder <strong>Redrow</strong> said the UK housing market has moderated in recent months and predicted sales rates will return to historically average rates over the current financial year. For the year ended June Redrow posted 23 per cent lower pre-tax profit at £314m, with revenue down 8 per cent at £1.9bn. Recent trading has been “encouraging” with house price inflation more than offsetting build cost increases, Redrow said.</p> <p><strong>Tullow Oil</strong> swung into profit in the first half on the back of oil prices and a debt refinancing. The West Africa-focused explorer posted a $93m pre-tax profit, versus a $1.3bn loss the year before, in spite of lower production. Tullow also revealed that Les Wood, its chief financial officer since 2017, had mutually agreed with the board that he will step down.</p> <p><strong>Fevertree Drinks</strong> said underlying earnings rose in the first half as sales growth in the US and Europe offset higher costs to cope with supply chain disruption. Sales direct to consumers rather than to the hospitality industry exceeded expectations across all regions and remained above pre-pandemic levels, it said. The tonic water maker posted an adjusted ebitda of £29.2m, up 23 per cent year on year, as total sales rose 36 per cent to £141.8m. Disruption and elevated logistics costs will continue to have an impact through the remainder of this year and into 2022, Fevertree said.</p> <p><strong>Restaurant Group</strong>, owner of the Wagamama chain, raised its full-year earnings target based on the strength of trading since reopening. For the half year ended July the company posted an adjusted ebitda profit of £11.2m versus an £18.3m loss the year before. Reduced VAT and significant growth in the delivery market had boosted sales, but dine-in demand remained below 2019 levels, it said.</p> <p><strong>Trustpilot </strong>lifted full-year revenue growth targets on the back of strong recent trading. The review website's maiden results as a listed company revealed a first-half loss of $17.2m, widening from a $5.8m loss the year before. Revenue was up 31 per cent to $62m.</p> <p><strong>Character Group</strong> warned that supply chain problems, coupled with the pressure on the costs of production in China due to higher raw material and labour costs, have had an impact on profitability. The Aim-quoted maker of Peppa Pig and Pokemon toys said that thanks to mitigating actions underlying pre-tax profit for the year ended August will be no more than 10 per cent below the market's consensus forecast of £12m, it said. &#xa0;</p> <p>Toy maker <strong>Hornby</strong> said trading patterns through the summer have begun to return to pre-Covid levels, with sales and margins slightly lower than the previous year though in line with internal budgets. Hornby said its order book going into Christmas is substantially higher than a year ago but cautioned on potential supply disruption.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>America's fledging <strong>offshore wind power</strong> industry risks being left “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdee7b49-9355-4d88-ab79-3340127b4a86\">dead in the water</a>” if US authorities clamp down on the use of foreign materials and equipment, according to Avangrid of Spain, the Iberdrola-owned company jointly building the country's first big project.</p> <p><strong>Cryptocurrency hedge funds</strong>&#xa0;gained <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7bf6cf3-4167-49cb-9dd8-2d3b89c8a63f\">nearly 24 per cent&#xa0;in August</a> as large price swings in digital assets helped them outperform investors in sleepy equities and currencies markets.</p> <p><strong>US government bonds</strong> rallied while bank shares&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-7f9a9075-54c4-4108-93dc-aab0c243e6d1/C-VuOfox0qQUHaCFGJ6XiA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjJALbP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvN2Y5YTkwNzUtNTRjNC00MTA4LTkzZGMtYWFiMGMyNDNlNmQxP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjE0MTZmZjNjZmNjN2IwMDA0NzA1MDIyJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphQf99QWEA3HtsUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">weighed on major stock markets</a> as moderating US inflation warmed investors to the view that the Federal Reserve would have more time to remove crisis-era stimulus.</p> <p><strong>Apple</strong> launched&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27435aeb-ed0c-4536-ab55-37b6358591e3\">four 5G-enabled iPhones</a>&#xa0;and unveiled an array of refreshes to some of its most popular devices, including the iPad and Watch, as the world's most valuable company attempted to refocus the public's attention after months of antitrust scrutiny.</p> <p>The Irish data commissioner has launched investigations into <strong>TikTok</strong> over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31da34b7-5610-43a9-b9ee-78ef166ccd5c\">its handling of children's data</a> and alleged transfer of user information to China.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>EasyJet's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c43ab705-08ee-4fb3-9461-9010b105b3c9\">£1.2bn rights issue</a> was bigger than anything expected by the market and the airline has been unable to articulate what the money is for.
