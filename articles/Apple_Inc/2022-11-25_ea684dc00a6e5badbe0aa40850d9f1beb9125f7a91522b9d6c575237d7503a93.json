  "title": "Bear markets come in three stages; and we've only just started the second, says veteran analyst. Critical information for the U.S. trading day",
  "text": "<p>It's all too rosy, reckons Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group. In an interview with Magnifi+, an AI investing and trading platform, the veteran analyst warns that stocks will grind lower next year, and we have not seen the bottom of a bear market still in its middle phase.</p><p>\"Bear markets usually come in three stages. The first one is we take a lot of the frothy excesses and euphoria out of the market in terms of the sexy names that we saw in 2021 and we take a PE ratio down. We've done that, we went from 22 times earnings, call it 16 to 17,\" says Boockvar.</p><p>In the second phase, he adds, investors start calculating the economic and company earnings consequences of the ongoing rises in interest rates…\"and then the third phase is everyone throws in the towel. No one wants to own a stock again, and that's your bottom and that's when you need to be buying stocks hand over fist.\"</p><p>\"I feel like we're really just only beginning to start that second phase,\" he said.</p><p>Still, there will be opportunities. It all depends on your time scale, according to Boockvar.</p><p>\"If you have a big purchase that you have to make within the next year or two, whether it's a kid going college or it's a wedding, a bar mitzvah or some other expense like a home that you have put aside money for, it should not be in the stock market. It should be in the bank it should be in short-term T-bills. It should be in cash equivalents because the next couple of years are going to be challenging for those with shorter-term time horizons,\" he said.</p><p>So, what assets is he interested in? Bonds are attractive, but it's important to stick to quality.</p><p>\"You have investment-grade bonds that are yielding 6% and you can do that without taking much duration risk by buying shorter-term durations….And you can buy a short-term, two-year treasury and get a yield of four and a half percent and get some attractive Munis too. So fixed-income land, with shorter durations, I believe, is more attractive. Longer-term trade durations, I'm still more suspect on,\" says Boockvar.</p><p>And in equities? \"Value stocks are much more attractive than growth, the tech stocks. I think commodity stocks are much more attractive than they've been over the past five years. Certainly energy, precious metals, even industrial metals like copper stocks.\"</p><p>If the dollar has peaked and pulls back as the Fed gets closer to the end of its hiking cycle, then Boockvar likes the look of foreign markets, particularly in Asia, and gold and silver once the central bank begins cutting rates.</p><p>Finally, the one thing he's certainly not keen on are techs former darlings. \"Just buying Google GOOGL and Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL, while they're all great companies, that ship has sailed and the baton in terms of market leadership is going to be passed to other parts of the market,\" says the analyst.</p><p>Markets</p><p>Stocks were in line to start the last trading of the week on the front foot, with S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 up 0.2% to 4039 and 10-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y were little changed at 3.709%. U.S. crude futures fell 0.7% to $79.50 a barrel.</p><p>For more market updates plus actionable trade ideas for stocks, options and crypto, subscribe to MarketDiem by Investor's Business Daily .</p><p>The buzz</p><p>It's a half-day of trading for Wall Street as many traders also extend their Thanksgiving break.

Historically, that has had some predictive power for lower volatility to come.\"</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>Here were the most active stock-market tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m. Eastern. </p><p> Ticker  Security name  TSLA    Tesla  GME     GameStop  AMC     AMC Entertainment  NIO     NIO  COSM    Cosmos Holdings  AAPL    Apple  APE     AMC Entertainment preferred  BBBY    Bed Bath &amp; Beyond  AMZN    Amazon.com  MULN    Mullen Automotive</p><p>Random reads</p><p>Japan fans show the world how it's done.</p><p>Coin study suggests 'fake emperor' was real.</p><p>Someone's been going on a gold-buying bender.</p><p>Need to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
