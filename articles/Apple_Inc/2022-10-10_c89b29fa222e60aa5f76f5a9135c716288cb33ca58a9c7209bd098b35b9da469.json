  "text": "<p>\"Consumer demand has remained muted though promotional activity from the likes of Apple AAPL and other players has helped soften the fall and reduce channel inventory by a couple weeks across the board,\" said IDC's Mobile Device Trackers research manager Jitesh Ubrani in a statement.</p><p>Three months ago, Ubrani said that Apple had been targeting higher volumes, but lockdowns in China and worsening logistics pushed shipments meant for the second quarter into the third.</p><p>In the afternoon, investors get to compare IDC's numbers with those of research firm Gartner, which uses slightly different metrics.</p><p>While levels are off year-over-year, they're still better than those reported before COVID-19, when demand for PCs was driven by business spending from firms shoring up losing support for Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT Windows 7, Ubrani said.</p><p>Back in July, numbers reported by IDC and Gartner showed the worst pullback in PC shipments in at least a decade, but 2021 posted some of the best shipping numbers in about a decade, supplying workers with work-from-home infrastructure.</p><p>In the third quarter, Lenovo Group Ltd. HK:992 increased market share slightly, even as shipments declined 16.1% to 16.9 million units from a year ago, according to IDC. HP Inc. HPQ shipments fell 27.8% to 12.7 million units, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL shipments declined 21.2% to 12 million, and Asustek Computer Inc. TW:2357shipments slipped 7.8% to 5.5 million units, the research firm said.</p><p>The only laptop maker reporting a rise in shipments was Apple, with shipments jumping 40.2% to 10 million, according to IDC figures.</p><p>Apple shares were up 0.3% at last check Monday, compared with a 0.8% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX and a 1.2% decline in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP.</p><p>PC sales log third straight quarter of declines while Apple reports growth</p>",
