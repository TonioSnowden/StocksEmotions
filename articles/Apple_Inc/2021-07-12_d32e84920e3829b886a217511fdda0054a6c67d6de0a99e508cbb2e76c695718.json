  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Careers & Leadership:  From Google  to Roblox,  Building a  Tech Career  ----  By Kathryn Dill",
  "text": "<p>\n  At 26, Andrea Fletcher has already worked for Google, Apple and Roblox. She says her career in software engineering really began with a childhood love of logic puzzles that involve math and patterns. Then, as a senior in high school, thanks to a gentle nudge from her dad, she took a computer-science elective. </p><p>\n  Ms. Fletcher loved coding and problem-solving. Today, as a full-stack software engineer at Roblox, the online platform where 43 million people build and play games every day, she gets to do both. </p><p>\n  The Wall Street Journal recently spoke with Ms. Fletcher, who has been working remotely from her parents' home in Atlanta for the past year. Here's the edited interview. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What drew you to software engineering? </p><p>\n  A: My dad is the one who I can thank for getting me into computer engineering. Senior year of high school, I needed to take an AP class and I was going to do AP art. He was like, \"Try computer science.\" </p><p>\n  I had never touched computer programming before, and I fell in love with it. It's very satisfying. You make a change, you see the output. I decided to major in it. </p><p>\n  Most of the developers that I know started programming when they were like 10 or 12. I look back at little Andrea and I'm like, 'Oh man, I wish you had Roblox!' I'm getting to experience that as an adult now -- the childlike excitement of building something new and sharing it with your friends. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: You majored in computer science at Georgia Tech and then went to the San Francisco Bay area, where you parlayed two summer internships with Google into a full-time engineering role at Apple. How'd you decide to move on to Roblox? </p><p>\n  A: I had left my job [with Apple], and I was unemployed for a couple of months and looking. A recruiter reached out to me. I looked at Roblox and I was really interested. Never rule out cold emails from recruiters, especially if it's an interesting company. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Why leave Apple? </p><p>\n  A: It was a great job, at a great company, with great people, but the job itself wasn't a good fit. At the end of the day, I just wasn't really excited to go to work. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your advice for someone who realizes their first job isn't the right job for them? </p><p>\n  A: A lot of people are pressured by money or stock-vesting cliffs to stay at a company for X number of years, but my growth increased once I was in a role that I liked and was better at. It's okay for something to be a bad fit. It's not just, \"Is it good or bad?\" It's, \"Is it right for you?\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's the best part of working at Roblox? </p><p>\n  A: Definitely interacting with our developers, because I'm a people-motivated person. I love technical challenges. Whenever I get to see a game that someone in our developer community made -- or something that they worked on -- it makes me more motivated. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your typical day like? </p><p>\n  A: Most of my day is spent coding, maybe like two-thirds of it. The longer you're an engineer, you end up spending more time on reviews [of other people's code] and working with other people, which is something that I really like -- bouncing ideas back and forth. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's the most challenging part of your job? </p><p>\n  A: Building things that are future-proof. As Roblox scales, it's really important, too. To be a great engineer, you need to think, \"How can I build this so that everyone can benefit from it?\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What about your internships during college? </p><p>\n  A: I had three: One was at a network security company and then the following two at Google. </p><p>\n  At the first, I got hired on as a marketing intern. They wanted me to combine a bunch of Excel files. Someone spotted me using programming and they were like, \"What are you doing, you're a marketing intern!\" I kind of got adopted by one of the people there and given a data set like, \"You want to try out some stuff with it?\" It was really fun and free-form. </p><p>\n  I got my first Google internship through Grace Hopper, [an annual conference for women in computing]. The career fair there is amazing, it really helped me feel more confident in interviews. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Were internships crucial to your job hunt? </p><p>\n  A: Mine definitely were. My experience definitely helped me figure out what I wanted in a job. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your best advice for somebody who wants a job like yours? </p><p>\n  A: In almost every interview I've had after college, it's been like, \"Tell me about a project that you really liked\" -- a school project, or an internship project, or a past job project. If you were really passionate about those, that's awesome. But if you haven't been excited about those, try to have a side project that you can go into an interview and talk about endlessly. </p><p>\n  It'll make you more memorable. It's really clear when someone's passionate about what they've worked on. </p><p></p>",
