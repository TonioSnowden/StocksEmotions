  "title": "Kevin McCarthy: Republican political operator poised to become House Speaker",
  "text": "<p>In the days after January 6 2021, when Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the then president bore “responsibility” for the attack and chastised him for failing to denounce the mob. Just two weeks later, however, McCarthy posed for a smiling photo with Trump at his gilded Palm Beach resort. Trump called their meeting “cordial”, and vowed to work with McCarthy to help the Republicans achieve a majority in the House.</p> <p>Now, on the eve of US midterm elections, opinion polls suggest the Republicans are poised to do just that. If they do, McCarthy will probably be installed as Speaker of the House, succeeding Nancy Pelosi. That would make the 57-year-old arguably the most powerful Republican in Washington. </p> <p>Like other Speakers before him, McCarthy will need to wrangle a raucous band of lawmakers; former Speaker John Boehner once likened the job to keeping “218 frogs in a wheelbarrow long enough to get a bill passed”. McCarthy is expected to take the gavel at a time of unprecedented partisan rancour, with Democrats still livid about January 6, and Republicans wrestling over their party's future. He will also need to navigate “divided government” and decide whether to work with Democratic lawmakers and the Biden White House — or against them. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3fcda1a2-9b04-4f11-a9e1-b06b53fb662e\">McCarthy</a> has already threatened to use raising America's debt limit as leverage to force domestic spending cuts and withhold additional funding for Ukraine. </p> <p>A Trump bid would likely cast a shadow over McCarthy's speakership, bringing into sharp relief the rollercoaster relationship between the former president and the man he has called “my Kevin”. The New York Times obtained audio earlier this year in which McCarthy told colleagues in the wake of January 6: “I've had it with this guy”. Earlier this week, Trump confidante Kellyanne Conway told reporters that the two men remain “close”. “Kevin is of the belief that burning bridges is never a way to be effective,” says John Stipicevic, a lobbyist and former top congressional aide to McCarthy.</p> <p>McCarthy was born in Bakersfield — a midsized city in California's central valley — in 1965. His father was a firefighter, and his grandfather a cattle rancher. As a child, he struggled with a speech impediment. McCarthy met his future wife, Judy, at high school, then dropped out of college following a win of $5,000 in the state lottery. He used the winnings to start a small deli business, which he later sold before returning to college at California State University Bakersfield. While there, he began working for the local <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/18579e91-20a8-4654-baff-5d8c7dd01eac\">Republican</a> congressman, Bill Thomas, who would become his political mentor.</p> <p>Elected to California's state assembly in 2002, McCarthy quickly rose through the ranks. Four years later, he was elected to Congress, filling the seat of his old boss. McCarthy once again made a name for himself, gaining a reputation for being both affable and hard-working. He become majority whip — a job in which he was shadowed by Kevin Spacey while the actor researched his role for the TV drama <em>House of Cards</em>. </p> <p>In 2015, McCarthy launched a bid to succeed Boehner as Speaker, then withdrew his candidacy after failing to secure enough support. But this time around, he is expected to win if his party takes back control of the House, with both allies and critics noting how he has worked painstakingly to cultivate close relationships and curry favour from all factions of his party. </p> <p>A prolific fundraiser with a knack for recruiting congressional candidates, McCarthy has raised more than $100mn to elect other Republicans since the start of the 2016 election cycle, according to non-partisan group OpenSecrets. “He is the consummate political operator and insider, who understands what makes his colleagues tick, and uses his personality and relationships as his biggest political strength,” says Brendan Buck, a former aide to both Boehner and former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.</p> <p>Republicans credit McCarthy with building broad consensus among GOP lawmakers in recent years. But he has been criticised for failing to censure divisive party members such as Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was stripped of her committee assignments last year by the Democrats over her previous endorsement of QAnon conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Allies say McCarthy sees his role as building consensus among Republicans of all stripes, pointing to his mantra: “I don't get to hire who works with me, and I don't get to fire who works with me . . . I just have to inspire.” </p> <p>But others are suspicious of his attempts to play both sides. Shortly after January 6, Thomas told a local television station that his one-time protégé was a “hypocrite”. Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant and prominent Trump critic, says he is “disappointed” by McCarthy's political path. “I don't believe for a moment that [McCarthy] has completely bought into this MAGA movement,” he says. “He just knows that that's where the party is, and if he wants to be Speaker and continue on the trajectory he's on, he's going to have to join that chorus.”</p> <p>Others are more sanguine. Rob Stutzman, another longtime Republican operative in California, says the lawmaker is “trying to hold together a political coalition”. “I don't think Kevin is part of the problem,” Stutzman says. “Now you could argue he isn't necessarily a part of an ultimate solution, but I think he would like to be.”</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:lauren.fedor@ft.com\"><em>lauren.fedor@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c41f1b5-7fa6-4bd2-9fc1-c8d1db1a2870\"><em>If UK is relishing Pelosi's ousting, it must think again</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c41f1b5-7fa6-4bd2-9fc1-c8d1db1a2870\"><em>From Liam Pluck, Enniskerry, County Wicklow, Ireland</em></a></p><p>Source: Lauren Fedor 2022 'Kevin McCarthy: Republican political operator poised to become House Speaker' FT.com 4 November.
