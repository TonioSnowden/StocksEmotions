But there's nothing cheap about its performance. This mid-engine coupe, a hardtop version of the 718 Boxster, has the same dynamic talents and depth of engineering as its vaunted Porsche POAHY 911 sibling.</p><p>PorscheSome enthusiasts might argue that the 718 Cayman – with its mid-engine chassis – is the ideal Porsche because it doesn't have its engine in the trunk, and is, therefore, better balanced. And now that there are two new versions of the Cayman with 6-cylinder power, that argument is being heard now more than ever.</p><p>However you feel on the subject, there's no denying that the 718 Cayman is as comfortable everyday 2-seater than can be appreciated on the road or track.</p><p>2021 Porsche 718 Cayman pricing</p><p>The 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of $59,900, plus a $1,350 destination fee.</p><p>The 6-cylinder models begin with the Cayman GTS 4.0, which starts at $86,800. The 2021 718 Cayman GT4 is priced at $100,200.</p><p>An Audi TTS Coupe, at around $55,000, competes with the Cayman, as do the Ford F Shelby GT350 and GT500 Mustangs. The new mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette also should be considered.</p><p>When you order options like PDK, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Torque Vectoring, the Sport Chrono Package, and navigation, the price of the 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman can grow by $10,000.</p><p>Always check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what buyers in your area are paying for their new Porsche 718 Cayman.

The kinetic thrills truly are exhilarating, stirring, and satisfying.</p><p>While the Cayman shines on curvy mountain roads, it doesn't come at the expense of good ride quality. This mid-engine Porsche is comfortable in the daily grind, and the electric-assist steering, shared with the 911 Turbo, also works well. Through the steering wheel, you get a good sense of what's happening at the front wheels.</p><p>Also read:Where is Tesla's Cybertruck?</p><p>If you plan to exercise your Cayman at weekend track events, order a GTS or a GT4 if it's within your budget. If not, get a T or a standard Cayman and order it with the Sport Chrono Package, Porsche Torque Vectoring (with a mechanical locking differential), and Porsche Active Suspension Management system, which offers a low-riding Sport mode. When driven hard, the Cayman with the turbo 4-cylinder is plenty quick, but the blat out of its exhaust is nowhere near as seductive as the beautiful tune emanating from the flat-6's pipes.</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>Even though it's a low-slung 2-seat coupe, the Porsche 718 Cayman manages to accommodate occupants over 6 feet tall. Getting in and out can be a bit awkward, but once you're in the driver's seat, you'll find plenty of legroom.</p><p>The cabin itself has a classic look, but it's far from ornate. The instrument cluster emphasizes the importance of the tachometer, which takes on more importance with the high-revving 6-cylinder engines. Materials are premium quality; fit and finish are suitably top-notch. Comfier seats, finer leathers, and multiple color schemes are available.</p><p>Check out: Want a faster car? Just download more horsepower</p><p>Storage space in the Cayman is split into two sections because of the mid-engine design. Under the hood up front is 5.3 cubic feet of cargo area; at the rear is 9.7 cubic feet.</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>The 2021 718 Cayman has a classic Porsche coupe profile with a long and low nose and a rounded-off cabin that slopes down to a short tail. All the lines and proportions work together. Sharp edges, bold lighting elements, and prominent side air intakes – to feed and cool the turbo engines – add a certain intensity.</p><p>Depending on the variant, the 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman runs on wheels that range in size from 18 to 20 inches.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>PDK 7-speed transmissionThe optional PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) dual-clutch automatic transmission shifts gears faster than any driver,&#xa0;and it improves acceleration times. Paddles behind the steering wheel add to the fun, as do the automatic throttle-blip downshifts that occur when you're driving aggressively. Also, there's no such thing as a missed shift with PDK.</p><p>Sport Chrono PackageThe Sport Chrono Package has a dash-mounted stopwatch and four driver modes, along with a launch control function (on models with the PDK transmission). It's optional in the base and S Caymans, but standard on all other models.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>The Porsche 718 Cayman is a premium coupe with all the right sports car parts: supportive sport seats, a slick-shifting manual transmission, an eager mid-mounted engine, and a sublime suspension.</p><p>You might like:2021 Jaguar XF is stylish in its own way, and it drives beautifully</p><p>That stated, there are plenty of creature comforts. Two-zone automatic climate control is new this year, as are heated seats, Apple CarPlay, a 6-speaker stereo, front and rear parking sensors), and complimentary roadside assistance for four years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first.</p><p>Factory options</p><p>Rather than buy the base 2021 718 Cayman and add some performance hardware, it could be smarter to consider the new 718 Cayman T to access 20-inch alloy wheels, active suspension, mechanical locking differential with torque vectoring, and the Sport Chrono Package.</p><p>The 718 Cayman range offers versions with greater power, and the PDK transmission is a popular option. If there are track days on the horizon, definitely look into the ceramic-composite brakes.</p><p>Also notable: The 7-speed PDK automatic transmission now is also available on the 718 Cayman GTS 4.0 and 718 Cayman GT4 models. Porsche says these models, with PDK, are expected to arrive in early 2021.</p><p>Lane Change Assist (a blind-spot warning) continues to be a wise option, as does adaptive cruise control. Also available: 18-way power-adjustable seats and a 12-speaker/821-watt Burmester surround-sound system.</p><p>Don't miss:9 of the wildest financial crime stories of 2021</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>Mounted directly behind the Cayman's two seats are the mid-mounted engines. The standard 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman and 718 Cayman T have a turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-4 generating 300 horsepower, along with 280 lb-ft of torque coming in at 1,950 rpm.</p><p>The 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman S has a 2.5-liter flat-4 developing 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque at 1,900 rpm.</p><p>The 2021 Porsche Cayman GTS 4.0 and 718 Cayman GT4 are powered by a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-6 with 394 and 414 horsepower, respectively. These 6-cylinder engines transform the Cayman into a much more serious sports car. The GT4, in case you were wondering, has a top track speed of 188 mph.</p><p>Also see: The 2022 Audi R8 is packed with power and exotic performance</p><p>A 6-speed manual transmission is standard.
