  "title": "Amazon Gets Federal Order To Hold New Union Vote",
  "text": "<p>The NLRB ruled that Amazon's actions throughout the mail-in election -- including its decision to install a U.S. Postal Service collection box that could have confused employees -- were grounds to nullify the results and hold the vote again. It is unclear when a new vote will be held, and Amazon might yet appeal to the NLRB's governing board in Washington, according to a spokeswoman for the agency.</p><p>\"Today's decision confirms what we were saying all along -- that Amazon's intimidation and interference prevented workers from having a fair say in whether they wanted a union in their workplace,\" said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The RWDSU ran the campaign to unionize Amazon workers in Alabama.</p><p>An Amazon spokeswoman said company employees \"have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU earlier this year. It's disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn't count.\" The spokeswoman said a union would hamper the efficiency of improving company policies quickly and nimbly. The company has previously said that it didn't violate labor laws and treats workers fairly.</p><p>Amazon has said that the election results are evidence of its standing with workers. After the vote concluded, Chairman Jeff Bezos said that Amazon needed a \"better vision\" for its workforce. He set a company goal to be \"Earth's best employer\" and \"Earth's safest place to work.\"</p><p>Amazon can appeal the decision to the NLRB's governing board in Washington, according to the NLRB spokeswoman. The NLRB is a federal government agency in charge of enforcing U.S. labor law in collective bargaining and worker disputes.</p><p>With Democrats holding a majority of the five-person board, labor researchers expect the board to side with workers more than during former President Donald Trump's administration.</p><p>Another election could happen sometime in the next several months, and the NLRB may schedule a vote that is held before its governing board rules on Amazon's appeal, according to an agency spokeswoman.</p><p>Working conditions for Amazon warehouse employees have been in focus since the pandemic forced widespread lockdowns of schools and offices, prompting an uptick in online shopping that boosted demand for the company's products.</p><p>Amazon workers in several facilities walked out last year over working conditions. The company has strict performance rates and break policies that have drawn ire from labor activists and some government officials. Amazon has also been found to record higher injury rates than the national average, according to federal workplace data. Amazon has disputed those figures, saying it reports injuries more comprehensively than other companies.</p><p>Employee activism is on the rise at many of the world's largest technology companies, where workers have objected to business dealings with the U.S. armed services, climate-mitigation policies they deemed inferior, mandates to return to work or broad treatment of certain classes of workers.</p><p>Some employees at Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc. and other companies have taken issue with management and taken their complaints public. Amazon, however, is unique: A majority of its employees work in warehouses, are relatively unskilled and are on the front lines of a battle for low-skilled workers across the country.</p><p>Lisa Henderson, the regional director overseeing the case for the NLRB, ruled that Amazon's actions throughout the mail-in election were grounds to nullify the results and have the vote be held again.</p><p>In her ruling, Ms. Henderson said she agreed with an NLRB hearing officer in early August who found that the mailbox Amazon set up \"interfered with the laboratory conditions necessary to conduct a fair election.\" That is because it could have made employees believe Amazon played a role in collecting and counting ballots, she said. Amazon wasn't found to have accessed any ballots submitted through the mailbox.</p><p>In addition, employees could have perceived the company was tracking their vote through \"vote no\" pins and tags the company handed out because Amazon managers could see which employees took the pins, the hearing officer said.</p><p>Amazon has said the collection box was installed as a convenience to employees, and that it didn't seek to intimidate workers throughout the vote.</p><p>The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union would face an uphill battle on any new vote, given the margin of victory and employee turnover at the facility, labor researchers said.</p><p>Alabama workers began their campaign about a year ago. Organizers said a union would give workers more leverage in any disputes with the company and allow them to collectively bargain over safety standards, training, breaks, pay and other benefits, complaints that have popped up across many company facilities. Amazon held regular meetings inside the Alabama facility to make its case that unionization was unnecessary.</p><p>While some employees said they believed a union could help them negotiate better terms with Amazon on issues such as breaks, other workers said they were wary of union dues and weren't persuaded that the union would be able to add significantly to their pay or improve benefits.</p><p>The company has repeatedly raised wages this year to compete for workers as a labor shortage has rippled through the U.S. economy. In some areas, new Amazon employees have received hiring bonuses and pay around $20 an hour, and the company's starting pay now averages more than $18 an hour. In 2018, Amazon made its starting wage $15 an hour. Amazon doesn't have any unionized employees in the U.S.</p><p>A challenge for organizers is Amazon's high rate of turnover, with facilities across the company's network regularly churning through workers.</p>",
