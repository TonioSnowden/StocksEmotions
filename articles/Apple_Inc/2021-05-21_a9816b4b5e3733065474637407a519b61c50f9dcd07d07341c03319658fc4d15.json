  "text": "<p>The Epic vs Apple case approached its climax on Friday, with Tim Cook taking the stand as the star witness. The Apple chief's testimony is ongoing, but Twitter has been abuzz with some of his comments. “I'm not a gamer,” he's admitted and there has been derision over his claims that it has become a lot easier if users want to switch from an iPhone to an Android device.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86f8fa47-9a38-496a-9a34-e2fa58e9db2b\"><em>Patrick McGee in San Francisco reports</em></a> he testified that the iPhone was one product in a “fiercely competitive” market, as he sought to bat away allegations that the company was operating an illegal monopoly.</p> <p>Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, is arguing that Apple abuses its position by forcing developers to distribute applications through its App Store, where it takes a commission of 15-30 per cent.</p> <p>Cook reeled off a list of rival handset makers to illustrate the competitive marketplace, and said that iPhone customers valued the curated experience that came from having a single app store. “For us, the customer is everything,” he said. “We're trying to give the customer an integrated solution of hardware, software and services.” </p> <p>Epic has drawn on economists, fellow app developers and the words of Apple's own executives to make its case that Apple deliberately lured developers in with one set of expectations — an App Store that didn't seek to make profits, as Steve Jobs said in 2008 — before introducing a series of mechanisms to lock consumers into its ecosystem and make it difficult to switch. </p> <p>Lawyers for Epic on Friday grilled Cook on whether the App Store boasts margins of close to 80 per cent — a figure that Epic's expert witness introduced “from the files of Apple CEO Tim Cook”. Epic views this figure as a clear reflection of unduly high margins, reflecting its stranglehold on developers. </p> <p>Cook did not dispute the authenticity of the report but called it a “one-off” that did not accurately reflect all the investments Apple puts into the App Store. He said Apple does not break out profits and losses for the App Store. Apple has complained about “trial by anecdotes”. Its lawyers maintain Epic has failed to show that the App Store rules are unusual and that its 30 per cent fee is excessive. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86f8fa47-9a38-496a-9a34-e2fa58e9db2b\">Read more</a> </p> <h1>The Internet of (Five) Things</h1> <p><strong>1. WeWork quadruples losses, SoftBank makes changes</strong><br>WeWork's losses almost quadrupled to $2.1bn in the first quarter of 2021, as the co-working company haemorrhaged more than a quarter of its members over the past year and shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to restructure its property portfolio.

The glasses, which have been made available initially only to a group of app developers and creators who use the Snapchat social media app, have two small cameras and four microphones embedded in them so that users can take short video clips of what they see to save or send to others. The device weighs 134 grammes and has a battery life of about 30 minutes of continuous use. No pricing details have been disclosed. Initially launched in 2016, the original version of Spectacles — sunglasses with a built-in camera to capture and share video — failed to gain traction among Snap's teenage and millennial users. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/827c213f-fdd6-4307-8040-8aae8629a784\">Read more</a> </p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Cook takes stand in Epic case' FT.com 21 May.
