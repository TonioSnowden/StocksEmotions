  "title": "U.S. News: Big Tech Firms See Rate Deal as Positive",
  "text": "<p>A minimum tax, if adopted widely, would reduce the incentive for big companies to set up subsidiaries in tax havens. In each of the past five calendar years, between two dozen and three dozen of the 100 biggest companies by market capitalization reported effective tax rates of less than 15% , according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>It is unclear whether some of the most important signatories -- including the U.S. -- can deliver on the deal.</p><p>Silicon Valley, an industry facing among the biggest changes related to the tax deal, has generally supported an overhaul, even if it might mean paying more tax -- and it isn't yet clear how many, if any, would have to do that. Tech giants have embraced the overhaul because they say it would eliminate a growing array of separate tax regimes in place or threatened in a host of countries, including the U.K. and France.</p><p>Tech lobbyists remain adamant, however, that a global tax deal must include the withdrawal of digital-services taxes, like those implemented in several European countries. Those taxes have sparked threats of retaliatory tariffs on European goods from the U.S., raising the specter of a trade war if no deal were reached.</p><p>\"Industry looks forward to engaging on the details of the implementation plan, and urges countries to remove digital-services taxes and forgo plans to adopt similarly discriminatory national measures,\" said Matt Schruers, president of the of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, which represents companies including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook.</p><p>Final negotiations to iron out the details of new tax rules are expected to stretch until the fall.</p><p>\"We recognize that many outstanding decisions remain. We plan to engage with participating governments ahead of the October meetings to ensure a functioning and dependable global tax system that promotes investment and innovation and provides certainty and predictability for businesses,\" said Jason Oxman, president and chief executive of ITI, a tech-industry trade group that includes Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook and Google.</p>",
