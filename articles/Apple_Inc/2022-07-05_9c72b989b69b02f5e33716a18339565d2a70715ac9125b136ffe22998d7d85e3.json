  "title": "World News:  Hacked Data Up for Sale  ---  Vast cache of Chinese  citizens' information  was allegedly stolen  from police files  ----  By Karen Hao in Hong Kong and Rachel Liang in Singapore",
  "text": "<p>   A vast trove of data on Chinese citizens allegedly siphoned from a police database, some of which checks out as legitimate, is being offered for sale by an anonymous hacker or hacking group. If confirmed, it would mark one of history's largest leaks of personal data. </p><p>   The cache allegedly includes billions of records stolen from police in Shanghai, containing data on one billion Chinese citizens, according to a post advertising its availability that was published on Thursday by the hacker on a popular online cybercrime forum. The post, which began circulating on social media over the weekend, put the price for the leak at 10 bitcoin, or roughly $200,000. </p><p>   Cybersecurity experts say the claimed hack is alarming not just for its alleged size -- which would rank among the biggest ever recorded and the largest known for China -- but also because of the sensitivity of the information contained in the government database. </p><p>   A sample of the data posted by the hacker, who claimed it included 750,000 records, contained individuals' personal names, national ID numbers, phone numbers, birthdays and birthplaces, as well as detailed summaries of crimes and incidents reported to the police. The cases ranged from incidents of petty theft and cyber fraud to reports of domestic violence, dating as far back as 1995 to as recently as 2019. </p><p>   While the scope of the data leak remains unconfirmed, reporters verified several of the records in the leak by calling people whose numbers were listed. Five people confirmed all of the data, including case details that would be difficult to obtain from any source other than the police. Four more people confirmed basic information such as their names before hanging up. </p><p>   One woman, alarmed at the accuracy of the leaked details, asked whether the information about her had come from the iPhone that she had reported stolen in her case file in 2016. </p><p>   Another man, surnamed Wei, who had reported being defrauded of 30,000 yuan after scammers persuaded him to join an investment scheme, according to the records released by the hacker, sighed after hearing that his data had been leaked. \"We are all running naked,\" he said, using popular Chinese slang for a lack of privacy. </p><p>   Cybersecurity experts remain cautious about believing all of the hackers' claims. </p><p>   Troy Hunt, a web-security consultant based in Australia, said the sheer size of the database -- which would include the majority of China's population of 1.4 billion people -- drew some suspicion, as did the anonymity of the user who posted the information. </p><p>   While most hackers are driven by financial motives, the solicitation for a large sum of money also raises the possibility that the claim has been exaggerated or falsified, Mr. Hunt said. </p><p>   The Shanghai police, Shanghai propaganda office and Chinese internet regulator didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   On the forum where the database has been posted for sale, the hacker or group has claimed that the breach targeted Aliyun, a cloud computing subsidiary of Alibaba Group, which they said hosts the Shanghai police database. </p><p>   Alibaba said it was aware of the incident and was investigating it. </p><p></p>",
