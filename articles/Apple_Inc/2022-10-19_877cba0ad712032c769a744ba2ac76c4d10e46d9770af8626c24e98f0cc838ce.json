  "title": "Charles Barkley signs 'life altering' $100 million deal to stay with TNT's 'Inside the NBA'; Basketball hall of famer Barkley has signed a huge new contract to stay with the Warner Bros. Discovery unit",
  "text": "<p>See: Amazon is proving it's a contender to land NBA rights</p><p>Also: Trump tells golfers to 'take the money' from LIV Golf or 'pay a big price'</p><p>Barkley's reported agreement coincides with contract renewals for fellow \"Inside the NBA\" crew members Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal. Contract figures for those individuals are not currently known.</p><p>Barkley, an 11-time NBA all-star tapped as one of the league's 75 greatest players, has been with TNT since retiring as a player in 2000. He had publicly toyed over the summer with the idea of providing commentary for Saudi-funded LIV Golf but eventually decided against the controversy-courting move.</p><p>\"We're all a big family — Ernie, Kenny and Shaquille are brothers to me — and I wouldn't still be here if it wasn't for them and all the amazing people who work on our show,\" Barkley said in a statement. \"I'm not gonna lie, though, this is a life-altering deal … and I'm blessed to be able to do live television for a living.\"</p><p>\"Inside the NBA\" began its 34th season on Tuesday as the 2022–23 NBA season tipped off. Johnson has been with the show since the beginning, while Smith became a studio analyst in 1998. O'Neal joined them in 2011.</p><p>During the opening-night broadcast, O'Neal could be heard congratulating Barkley on his new contract, yelling, \"Chucky 200!\"</p><p>Barkley had previously said he planned to retire from broadcasting in the next two years. \"I don't want to die on TV. I want to die on the golf course or somewhere fishing,\" he told the Dallas Morning News earlier this year.</p><p>As part of the deal, Barkley will also produce documentaries and other projects with his production company, Round Mound Media, the New York Post indicated. (Barkley was fitted with the nickname Round Mound of rebound during his college years at Auburn.)</p><p>See also: Kanye West agrees to buy Parler. Here's everything you need to know about the controversial social media platform.</p><p>Barkley is widely considered one of the most popular studio analysts of all time and has won four Sports Emmy Awards as outstanding studio analyst for his work on TNT.</p><p>The deals with Barkley, Johnson, Smith and O'Neal last well beyond the end of Turner's current deal to broadcast NBA games, which runs through 2024–25. The league is expected to begin rights negotiations soon. Turner has been carrying games since 1984, while ESPN/ABC replaced NBC in 2002.</p><p>The other major sports leagues have recently negotiated new rights deals. Amazon is in its first season carrying the NFL, with the league's other contract renewals kicking in next season. Major League Baseball's new contracts with Fox, ESPN and Turner began this year, while the NHL's deals with Turner and ESPN are in their second season.</p><p>Major League Soccer signed a deal with Apple TV+ AAPL that starts next season — Apple has also been rumored to be interested in the NFL's highly sought-after Sunday Ticket package.</p><p>The news of Barkley's lucrative extension comes as contracts for major sports broadcasters are ballooning. In May, Tom Brady signed a $375 million contract with Fox Sports to provide on-air commentary on NFL games when he retires, and Walt Disney DIS inked Troy Aikman to a reported five-year, $90 million contract, and play-by-play man Joe Buck to a five-year deal valued at $75 million.</p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p><p>Charles Barkley signs 'life altering' $100 million deal to stay with TNT's 'Inside the NBA'</p>",
