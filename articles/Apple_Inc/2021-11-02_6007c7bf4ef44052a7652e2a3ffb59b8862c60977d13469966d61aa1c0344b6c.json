Military permits for Palestinian construction are rarely granted and unauthorized structures often are demolished. </p><p>\n  An Israeli security official confirmed the approval of the Palestinian housing, saying it authorized existing homes and gave permission to build new ones, without providing a breakdown. </p><p>\n  Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  U.K.-FRANCE </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Fishing Talks Held </p><p>\n  As Deadline Looms </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  French and British officials met Monday to talk about fishing, as the deadline for a threatened French blockade of British boats and trucks approached. </p><p>\n  The European Commission said it had called a meeting involving officials from Britain, France and the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, which are self-governing British Crown dependencies with control over their own territorial waters. </p><p>\n  France has threatened to bar British boats from some of its ports and tighten checks on boats and trucks carrying British goods if more French vessels aren't licensed to fish in U.K. waters by Tuesday. The French president's office said Monday that the port blockade would begin at midnight if no compromise is found. </p><p>\n  The U.K. played down the significance of Monday's meeting, saying it was \"part of the ongoing, continuing discussions that have been going on for months now.\" </p><p>\n  Both sides have accused each other of contravening the Brexit trade deal that the U.K. signed when it left the EU. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
