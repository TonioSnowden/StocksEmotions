  "title": "U.S. News: Apple to Reinstate App It Pulled After Riot",
  "text": "<p>In a letter to Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, both Republicans, Apple said Monday that a revised version of the Parler app with improved content moderation would be approved for release to Apple users.</p><p>The letter from Apple was posted on Twitter by Mr. Buck, and it was confirmed by Mr. Lee's office. Apple declined to comment. Parler didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In the letter, Apple stood by its initial decision to remove Parler from the app store, citing posts that denigrated races and religions, promoted Nazi ideology and called for violence. Since January, Apple has had \"substantial conversations\" with Parler, and the app maker proposed updates to its platform and its content-moderation policies, Apple said.</p><p>\"The App Review Team has informed Parler as of April 14, 2021 that its proposed updated app will be approved for reinstatement to the App Store,\" the letter said.</p><p>The letter, which didn't explain what changes Parler undertook, came in response to an inquiry that Messrs. Lee and Buck sent to Apple last month.</p><p>Mr. Buck said on Twitter that the decision was a \"huge win for free speech.\"</p><p>Parler LLC, which launched in 2018, landed in the middle of a debate about internet companies and free speech as it grew in popularity among supporters of then-President Donald Trump.</p><p>Parler is similar in format to Twitter Inc.'s platform. Its rise coincided with more aggressive efforts on Twitter's part to flag or remove content Twitter deemed objectionable or misleading.</p><p>As of February, Parler said it had more than 20 million users, according to Mark Meckler, its interim chief executive.</p><p>Parler held itself out as a Twitter competitor that would take a hands-off approach moderating content.</p><p>That policy made the platform an attractive online meeting place for supporters of the president', who grew aggrieved at Twitter's approach to content moderation as Mr. Trump worked to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and as Twitter eventually suspended his account.</p><p>In response to criticism that it served as a staging ground for the Capitol attack, Parler has said that it referred dozens of examples of violent content to the FBI in the weeks before the mob attack.</p><p>Apple had previously denied an earlier attempt by Parler to seek reinstatement.</p>",
