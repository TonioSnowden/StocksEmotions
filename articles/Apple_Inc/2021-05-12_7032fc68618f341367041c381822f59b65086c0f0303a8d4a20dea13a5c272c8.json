  "text": "<p>Taiwan's stock market, home to some of the world's biggest tech companies, suffered one of the largest drops in its history as investors were rocked by a worsening Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>The Taiex fell as much as 8.55 per cent on Wednesday, the index's worst intraday fall since 1969, according to Bloomberg. It finished down 4.1 per cent. </p> <p>Construction, rubber, automotive and financials — sectors retail investors had been shifting into from technology in recent months — were the worst hit in the sell-off.</p> <p>The world's largest contract chipmaker, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a>, which has a 30 per cent weighting in the index, fell as much as 9.3 before recovering ground to be down 1.9, while Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, dropped 9.8 per cent before paring losses to be down 4.7 per cent.</p> <p>While Taiwan's sell-off was related to domestic Covid-19 problems, it followed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd3abbb8-955a-46b3-bc45-9a4fb7b95265\">recent declines</a> in global markets as investors worried about possible inflationary pressures. </p> <p>The falls came as Taiwan's government was expected to partially close down public life to contain a worsening coronavirus outbreak — something the country had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98503350-9f67-11ea-b65d-489c67b0d85d\">managed to avoid</a> for more than a year.</p> <p>“The reason that triggered the escalated sell-off during the trading session is the new [Covid-19] cases to be reported this afternoon, and probably the raising of the pandemic alert level,” said Patrick Chen, head of Taiwan research at CLSA. “On top of that, the market before today was already at a point where the index was at an inflection point.”</p> <p>Taiwan's strict border controls and quarantine system and meticulous contact tracing measures had helped it avoid community spread of Covid-19 until recently. </p> <p>That success, which allowed Taipei to forego lockdowns, helped <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72b3f67b-c5a4-44b4-897e-96121b94c825\">boost the local economy</a>, which grew about 3 per cent last year and 8.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2021.</p> <p>But health authorities announced 16 locally transmitted confirmed cases on Wednesday, for three of which the infection source was unclear — a sign of widening spread in the community. Authorities had confirmed seven untraced cases on Tuesday, and domestic media reported that the government might introduce partial lockdown measures.</p> <p>President Tsai Ing-wen called on the public to be vigilant but avoid panicking.</p> <p>Taiwan's stock market rose almost 80 per cent over the past year, peaking at a historical high late last month. It is now down 8.5 per cent from that mark.</p> <p>Retail investors have increasingly moved out of technology stocks in recent weeks, reducing the sector's weight in trading volume from almost 80 per cent at its height to just over 50 per cent.</p><p>Source: Kathrin Hille in Taipei 2021 'Tech-heavy Taiwan stock index plunges on Covid outbreak ' FT.com 12 May.
