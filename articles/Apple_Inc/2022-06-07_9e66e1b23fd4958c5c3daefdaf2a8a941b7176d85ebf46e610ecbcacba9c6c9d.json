  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 132 points, or 0.4%, at 33,048.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX rose 16 points, or 0.4%, to about 4,138.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 53 points, or 0.4%, to trade around 12,115.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow eked out a gain of less than 0.1%, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4%.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>The stock market has flipped between gains and losses Tuesday, after a profit warning from retailer Target Corp. weighed on sentiment in early trade.</p><p>\"The market is still trying to digest this tug of war\" between inflation and the prospect of recession, said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer at Mercer Advisors. \"The shoe has yet to drop with respect to earnings.\"</p><p>Ahead of the opening bell, Target TGT announced a plan to reduce its excess inventory and revised lower its operating-margin guidance. The plan includes markdowns, canceling orders and removing inventory, along with price hikes to offset higher fuel and transportation costs, and supply chain adjustments such as increased holding capacity near U.S. ports.</p><p>Read: Retailers hit with 'double-whammy' as inventories rise, consumer sector stocks punished in May</p><p>Shares of Target were down around 3% in early afternoon trading Tuesday, and have dropped more than 40% from their 52-week high. Disappointing results from Target on May 18 sent stock indexes skidding, highlighting fears that surging inflation was beginning to cut into corporate earnings.</p><p>Several large retailers have delivered mixed earnings and outlooks in the latest quarterly reporting period, pressuring stock prices. Investors are trying to determine whether their results suggest the start of a potential recession, or just a shift in consumers spending to services from goods in the economic recovery from the pandemic.</p><p>See: Target's steps to reduce inventory glut are correct but are a few weeks late, analyst says</p><p>Choppy trade in the stock market also comes as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y hovers around 3%, a level that seems to make investors jittery. The 10-year yield was down 4 basis points at 2.99% Tuesday afternoon, according to FactSet data, at last check.</p><p>In One Chart: Why stock-market investors get 'squirrelly' when bond yields top 3%</p><p>Meanwhile, May's inflation data, as measured by the consumer-price index, will be released Friday.</p><p>In a paper published Monday, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers argued there will need to beVolcker-style aggressiveness at the Federal Reserve to tame inflation. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates sharply to quell surging inflation, with the economy tipping into an early recession in the 1980s.</p><p>\"Many are interpreting this finding as implying that the task facing Powell is almost as severe as the task that faced Volcker, that a similar amount of hawkish restraint — relative to today's neutral policy setting — might be required to do so, and that this would almost certainly end in recession,\" said Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI. Guha said his opinion is that Powell's task is not as difficult as Volcker's in the 1980s.</p><p>Meanwhile, the World Banksharply downgraded its outlook for the global economy, pointing to Russia's war against Ukraine, the prospect of widespread food shortages and concerns about the potential return of \"stagflation\" — a toxic mix of high inflation and sluggish growth unseen for more than four decades.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>* Kohl's Corp. KSS stock jumped 9% after The Wall Street Journal reportedthat Franchise Group FRG is in talks to buy the department store operator for roughly $8 billion.</p><p>* Shares of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. GT fell 0.8% after the tire maker issued a safety recall of more than 173,000 tires due to a defect that has led to crashes resulting in deaths and injuries, after initially declining a request for a recall.</p><p>* Shares of Apple AAPL rose 1.3% after revamping its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops Monday while previewing new software features that will let people customize their iPhone screens more.</p><p>How are other assets faring?</p><p>* The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, edge down less than 0.1%.</p><p>* Oil futures were down, with the U.S. benchmark CL.1 falling 1.2% to around $117 a barrel. Gold futures GC00 rose 0.4% to trade around $1,851 an ounce.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD fell 4.8% to $29,937.</p><p>* In European equities, the Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP closed 0.3% lower, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX slipped 0.1%.</p><p>* In Asia, the Shanghai Composite COMP edged up 0.2%, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI fell 0.6% in Hong Kong and Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK ticked up 0.1%.</p><p>—Steve Goldstein contributed to this report.</p><p>Dow rises as stocks shake off Target profit warning in choppy trade</p>",
