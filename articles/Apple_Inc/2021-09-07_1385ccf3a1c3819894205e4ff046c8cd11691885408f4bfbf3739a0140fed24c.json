  "title": "VC Daily: Tool Aims to Spot Startups With Top Managers",
  "text": "<p>The software tool, called Management Mosaic, conducts an \"algorithmic analysis\" using inputs about a startup's founding and management team. The inputs include data points on work history, business milestones achieved and professional networks to assign a score that is meant to reflect the likelihood that the team will create a \"successful outcome,\" such as an initial public offering or an acquisition.</p><p>As venture deal-making activity has soared amid a hot market, the tool is meant to assist in what is normally a time-consuming effort, CB Insights said.</p><p>CB Insights offered a test run of the product, identifying 15 seed-stage startups with the strongest founders and founding teams.</p><p>For instance, the tool assigned data-management startup Mozart Data a score of 960 out of 1,000. The program identified one of the founders, Peter Fishman, as a key person. Among other jobs, Mr. Fishman was previously head of strategy at medical cannabis delivery app Eaze Technologies Inc. and holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>How and to what extent venture investors implement this tool into their deal making strategy remains to be seen.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Debut venture funds step up. For years, first-time venture fundraising in the U.S. has been on the decline. This year, it is on track to reverse course. While megafunds continue to dominate, more debut-fund managers are striking out on their own, emboldened by strong returns in the markets, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports.</p><p>\"I finally have the confidence and track record to double down on myself,\" said Jenny Fielding, who is planning to leave Techstars, a New York startup accelerator where she has been managing director for the past seven years. This month, she will begin dedicating her full efforts to The Fund, a venture firm she co-founded that was previously a \"side hustle.\"</p><p>Debut funds in the market today are more likely to be led by female and minority managers and invest in undercapitalized technology sectors, like climate tech, according to an analysis by Different Funds.</p><p>The newcomers are bringing more competition to an already frothy startup market, as well as making it harder for larger venture partnerships to keep talented staff from jumping ship to pursue their own firms.</p><p>235,000</p><p>Number of jobs that were added in the U.S. in August, well below economists' estimates for 720,000 new jobs. (WSJ)</p><p>Regulators Investigate Crypto-Exchange Developer Uniswap Labs</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the startup behind one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, as regulators probe further into parts of the digital-asset market that have resisted oversight, according to people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reports. Regulators are examining Uniswap Labs, the main developer of the world's largest decentralized exchange, called Uniswap, the people said. Enforcement attorneys are seeking information about how investors use Uniswap and how it is marketed, the people said. A spokesman for Uniswap Labs said the company is \"committed to complying with the laws and regulations governing our industry and to providing information to regulators that will assist them with any inquiry.\"</p><p>Companies Need More Workers. Why Do They Reject Millions of Résumés?</p><p>Companies are desperate to hire, and yet some workers still can't seem to find jobs, WSJ reports. Here may be one reason why: The software that sorts through applicants deletes millions of people from consideration. Employers today rely on increasing levels of automation to fill vacancies efficiently, deploying software to do everything from sourcing candidates and managing the application process to scheduling interviews and performing background checks.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Canadian firm The51 Ventures is raising $25 million for its Food &amp; AgTech Fund, which is focused on women-led and diverse businesses in the agriculture, food and aquaculture technology sectors.</p><p>People</p><p>Transcarent, a provider of healthcare services for employees of self-insured employers, appointed Snezana Mahon as chief operating officer.
