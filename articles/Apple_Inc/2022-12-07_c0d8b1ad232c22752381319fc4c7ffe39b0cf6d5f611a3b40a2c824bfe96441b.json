  "text": "<p>Indiana filed a pair of lawsuits against TikTok Wednesday, alleging the platform is deceiving consumers about itscontent and data security and should be prohibited from allowing children to access adult content, including about sex, profanity and drugs.</p><p>The state said the lawsuits are the first of their kind against TikTok and its owner, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., amid scrutiny from federal lawmakers and state officials about the app's Chinese connections andinfluence on young users.</p><p>\"TikTok is actively exposing our children to drug use, alcohol abuse, profanity and sexually explicit material at a young age,\" Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, said. \"TikTok is deceiving Indiana parents.\"</p><p>TikTok representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The first of Indiana's lawsuits alleges that TikTok's algorithm is designed to addict young users and promotes harmful content that isn't appropriate for them. The suit cites studies and reports linking heavy use of the platform to mental disorders among teenagers, including eating disorders and depression.</p><p>The lawsuit alleges the platform, which has soared in popularity in recent years, is violating the state's consumer-protection laws by misrepresenting that it is appropriate for users ages 12 and older. For example, to have a 12-plus rating on Apple's App Store, TikTok must represent that references to mature themes, alcohol, drugs and sexual content are \"infrequent/mild,\" according to the lawsuit.</p><p>In fact, such material is abundantly available, from videos about hallucinogenic drugs and how to make alcohol taste like candy, to clips about strippers and sexual kinks, including bondage and rape fantasies, the state alleges.</p><p>The lawsuit seeks changes to TikTok's practices, as well as monetary damages.</p><p>Indiana's tandem lawsuit alleges the company is misleading consumers about access that the Chinese government could have to the app's U.S. users.</p><p>The suit alleges China has the ability to use TikTok's data to spy on, blackmail and coerce users to serve the country's national security and economic interests.</p><p>TikTok has faced persistent questions about data security and its Chinese connections, and some states have begun barring government use of the app.</p><p>TikTok Is Sued by State of Indiana, Accused of Targeting Young Teens With Adult Content</p>",
