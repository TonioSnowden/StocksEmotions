Today's US non-farm job payrolls <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85a619b7-105a-44a6-88cf-ac6f89f8d47e\">reported</a> 263,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, compared with an expected 200,000. This comes as a top Fed official <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de68e9e7-0887-420b-a1ac-12c27009bbd6\">warned</a> that US unemployment rate could hit 5 per cent next year.</p> <p>Added jobs are a blow to the markets. Wall Street stocks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd118019-1cd4-442d-b3e4-f9cc8164d0d0\">fell</a> sharply today and the dollar strengthened. Historically elevated vacancies added pressure on the Fed Reserve to pull the reins on the decades-high inflation. Earlier this week Fed Reserve chair Jay Powell said the demand for higher benchmark policy rates comes as the US central bank has seen “only tentative signs of moderation of labour demand”.</p> <p>This means that job losses are on the horizon. Indeed Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Fed, told the FT reduced supply of workers would probably mean the central bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4487d4e4-f39d-422a-be86-511dd1d79a42\">has to do more to bring down demand for new hires</a>.</p> <p>Workers are also affected by the Big Tech blues. Twitter has laid off thousands of workers since Elon Musk completed his purchase of the social media platform in October. This week Amazon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b42fe66-a376-47ac-abec-d9e7abc4a453\">identified cuts in its low-margin and costly hardware divisions</a> — the makers of Alexa, Kindle and the Halo health tracking device. Silicon Valley law firm Cooley, which counts Facebook owner Meta, Apple and Netflix among its clients, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b4b8f94-7720-4142-9792-29a53298bdb8\">announced it is axing over 100 lawyers</a> and other staff, following a dramatic slowdown in its technology practise. “What isn't clear to any of us is if it ends there,” said one Kindle employee. </p> <p>Across the Atlantic, yesterday's eurozone labour market data<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ec02af-6337-48cb-aad1-42b57b13d879\"> defied the gloom</a> though. The single market unemployment rate is at a record low at 6.5 per cent. A 142,000 reduction in jobless people was the largest drop since November 2021, but economists predict labour demand will wane.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK is braced for a wave of industrial unrest over the winter as the country faces a steep recession. Ambulance workers are the latest public sector employees to vote to go on strike, prompting prime minister Rishi Sunak <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e84ae7a-825c-4f1b-9eda-659407f0bec5\">to create a dedicated unit</a> to respond to the threatened “winter of discontent”. The days lost to labour disputes are currently incomparable to the strikes of 1978-9. Will that change when nurses, rail, postal and ambulance workers all strike?</p> <h1>Need to know: UK and Europe economy</h1> <p><strong>Europe</strong> is<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb098ccd-c74b-4c7e-8baa-e90546030fa5\"> on the breadline</a>. Inflation has overwhelmed food banks as a surge in demand has led organisations to turn people away.</p> <p><strong>Ukraine</strong> has restored some power, but <strong>Kyiv's</strong> allies are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a781fb71-49bb-4052-ab05-a87386bf3d5e\">concerned</a> by the struggle to increase ammunition production. Nations have been slow to sign contracts needed to boost supply.</p> <p>Brexit means Brexit. EU officials will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c024b54-a10b-4bf3-8373-54ec87d9448f\">raise concerns</a> that the UK's freeport scheme will violate the post-<strong>Brexit</strong> Trade and Cooperation Agreement at a meeting this week. Post-Brexit labour <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89f0fc87-ebad-47fd-bdd4-748c42c49a15\">shortages </a>also remain unsolved.</p> <p><strong>UK</strong> house prices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0d94ebf-b93f-4044-8487-12c621f93ba5\">fell </a>at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, excluding the spring lockdown of 2020. <strong>Nationwide</strong> said a drop of 1.4 per cent in November came as rising borrowing costs weighed on sentiment.

Quinn said the Chinese insurer's demands are not backed by other large shareholders or its customers.</p> <p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> chair Axel Lehmann said clients have begun to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1840027b-f26a-4d07-9727-8b9b18a92535\">return to the bank </a>after withdrawing tens of billions of dollars of assets following a “social media storm” which started in October.</p> <p>Latest in the <strong>Twitter</strong>-<strong>Apple</strong> spat, Elon Musk has said he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d691b35e-04e2-45eb-a3f0-1a69ea50cd40\">spoke </a>to Apple CEO Tim Cook and “resolved the misunderstanding” about his claim that Twitter may be removed from the App Store. Meanwhile the US and EU have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a07ca1ae-9f9a-46ee-9457-27bb30e18ed2\">turned up the heat </a>on Musk over Twitter.</p> <p><strong>Ford</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/world-uk\">announced</a> it would invest £150mn in its Halewood plant in Liverpool, with hopes to boost the UK's flailing car industry by expanding the production of electric vehicle parts.</p> <p>Profits at UK investment bank<strong> Peel Hunt</strong> were almost entirely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b6e0ff5-5a51-4cbd-a805-217f220eea65\">wiped out</a> after a plunge in company flotations and other equity-raising activity in 2022.</p> <h1>Science round-up</h1> <p>Chinese vice-premier <strong>Sun Chunlan</strong> said Covid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/322595d5-65f7-46de-aa06-f4111d05862c\">has entered a “new stage”</a> and the state-media have downplayed its risks, not long after officials in the southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc8502e1-a59b-4df2-a392-2fec4ab72edd\">eased restrictions</a>.</p> <p>Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Japan's Eisai and Biogen, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92e4a6d2-00fb-4b5d-9b2f-e8d5d97529a3\">hailed as a breakthrough</a> in the treatment of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong>.
