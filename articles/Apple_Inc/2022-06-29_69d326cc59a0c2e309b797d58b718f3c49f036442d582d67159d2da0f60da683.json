  "text": "<p>* Good fuel economy</p><p>* User-friendly technology</p><p>* Unique styling</p><p>Cons</p><p>* Tight cargo space</p><p>* Not much power</p><p>What's new?</p><p>* Denim trim renamed to Limited</p><p>* SEL Premium Package discontinued</p><p>* Standard sunroof on SEL trim</p><p>Price: Pricing for the 2022 Hyundai HYMTF Venue ranges from $19,000 (SE) to $22,250 (Limited).</p><p>The Hyundai Venue was recently introduced as the brand's entry-level SUV. It offers unique styling for drivers looking for a practical and affordable car that doesn't blend in with the crowd. The Venue impresses with good fuel economy from its sole engine option, a user-friendly infotainment system, and easy maneuverability thanks to its small footprint. All in all, this Hyundai is a good value, even in the top trim.</p><p>The 2022 Venue is a carryover model from last year, but a few small changes are worth mentioning. The top trim was formerly called \"Denim,\" but it's been renamed to \"Limited\" with the same list of features. Also, the SEL Premium Package has been dropped, but a power sunroof is now standard on the mid-range SEL trim.</p><p>As with other subcompact crossover SUVs like the Nissan NSANY Kicks and Kia KR:000270 Soul, the Hyundai Venue is front-wheel drive only, with no option for all-wheel drive. For that, you'll have to step up a size to the Hyundai Kona.</p><p>2022 Hyundai Venue pricing</p><p>The 2022 Hyundai Venue SE, with 15-inch alloy wheels and a tilt/telescope steering wheel, has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of $19,000, plus a destination charge. As a mid-level Venue SEL with 17-inch alloy wheels and a blind-spot warning system, this compact Hyundai starts at $20,750. Capping the lineup is the 2022 Hyundai Venue Limited, which has a 2-tone roof, a collision-avoidance system, and an MSRP of $22,250.</p><p>At these prices, the 2022 Hyundai Venue is very much in line with the Nissan Kicks and Chevrolet Trailblazer.</p><p>See: The SUVs that cost the least to own over 5 years</p><p>Driving the 2022 Hyundai Venue</p><p>The 4-cylinder engine in the Hyundai Venue delivers adequate grunt for daily driving, but it can feel a bit underpowered, especially on freeway on-ramps and when trying to pass on the highway. If you'll mostly be using the Venue for city driving, this engine does just fine.</p><p>The continuously variable transmission does a good job delivering power to the wheels, and it's responsive throughout the rev range. Switching over to Sport mode quickens the throttle response and reconfigures the transmission for a more engaging drive.</p><p>The Venue is an easy car to drive because of its small proportions. Its boxy shape makes it easy to discern where the four corners of the car are, making it easy to park and maneuver in tight spots. The ride quality is respectable, and wind noise is surprisingly low at highway speeds.</p><p>You might like: It's roomy, efficient, practical and comes as a hybrid, plug-in or EV: Which Kia Niro is best?</p><p>Interior comfort</p><p>The interior of the Hyundai Venue is pretty generous for passengers, but cargo space is tight. Even considering the fact that it's a subcompact crossover, there's very little cargo space, and most competitors have more room.</p><p>The front seats are spacious, and the rear seats are good for kids and adults alike. There's tons of headroom thanks to the boxy shape of the Venue. The seats are reasonably supportive and plenty comfortable for short highway commutes. If you are going on long road trips, your back seat passengers might get uncomfortable.</p><p>Interior quality is good overall. There are some hard plastics, but that's to be expected at this price point. The interior design is nice, and all controls are laid out simply and easily within reach of the driver.</p><p>Don't miss: The cars, trucks and SUVs with the best resale value</p><p>Exterior styling</p><p>Style is one of the strong suits of the Hyundai Venue. It has a corporate face similar to bigger Hyundai SUVs like the Santa Fe and Palisade, but the boxy body is unique. It has some eye-catching color schemes available, especially for the Limited model, like Denim blue with a white roof or Galactic Grey and Ceramic White with a black roof. No matter which paint job you go with, this is a stylish little crossover.</p><p>The small size of the Hyundai Venue makes it maneuverable and easy to park. Its dimensions are similar to the Kia Soul.</p><p>Favorite features</p><p>2- tone roofThe Venue is available with a few different 2-tone color schemes with an accent roof, adding extra flair to its unique aesthetic.</p><p>8-inch infotainment systemThe standard infotainment system in the Venue has a big, user-friendly screen with wireless Android Auto and Apple AAPL CarPlay.</p><p>Standard features</p><p>The base SE trim of the Hyundai Venue is pretty well-equipped considering its affordable price tag. The standard infotainment system is an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. That means you can connect your smartphone to the screen in your car for maps, music, and more while leaving it in your purse or your pocket.</p><p>The Venue's standard safety tech features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, driver attention warning, automatic high beams, and a backup camera.</p><p>Also on MarketWatch: Inflation is 'eroding the comfort level' Americans have about their cash savings</p><p>Factory options</p><p>There are two trims available above the base model: the mid-range SEL and the more premium Limited model. SEL adds more features yet is still a great value. It adds roof rails, power sunroof, bigger alloy wheels, rear disc brakes, Drive Mode Select with snow mode, automatic climate control, sliding armrest storage box, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.</p><p>Additional safety tech added to the SEL model includes blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.</p><p>The range-topping Limited trim adds heated front seats, satellite navigation, LED headlights, push-button start, leatherette seating surfaces, and a couple of unique 2-tone paint jobs available that include an accent roof.</p><p>Engine and transmission</p><p>The sole engine option under the hood of the Hyundai Venue is a modest 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 121 horsepower. It's linked to a CVT transmission that's pretty responsive and doesn't have the droning noise often associated with this type of transmission. The fuel economy of the Venue is pretty good, but the Nissan Kicks and Kia Soul are more efficient.</p><p>Front-wheel drive comes standard. Unlike several of its competitors, all-wheel drive is not an option.</p><p>1.6-liter inline-4121 horsepower @ 6,300 rpm113 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpmEPA city/highway fuel economy: 29/33 mpg</p><p>This story originally ran on KBB.com .</p><p>The easy-driving 2022 Hyundai Venue is practical but stands out in a crowd</p>",
