  "title": "'The Devil Wears Prada' Review: Basic Bland; With music by Elton John and lyrics by Shaina Taub, this Chicago stage adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's bestselling novel lacks much of the charm of the famous film version",
  "text": "<p>James M. Nederlander Theatre, 24 W. Randolph St., Chicago $33-$110, 800-775-2000, closes Aug. 21</p><p>One might begin, detail-wise, with the often dowdy ensembles worn by one of the two central characters, the supreme goddess of fashion Miranda Priestly (Beth Leavel), longtime editor-in-chief of Runway magazine. (Yes, it's Vogue, and she's an imitation Anna Wintour; Lauren Weisberger, who wrote the novel, was an assistant to Ms. Wintour.) Ms. Leavel is more than once displayed in double-breasted suits belted at an unflattering waist level, including one in which the buckle seems to be an iPhone that looks like a fanny pack.</p><p>The idea that a woman who dictates the imperatives of sophisticated dressing to the world would wear these corporate-lawyer clothes immediately makes you wonder just how perceptive the musical's creators—the composer, the pop-rock master Elton John, lyricist Shaina Taub (\"Suffs\"), book writer Kate Wetherhead, and director Anna D. Shapiro—are about the insular world they are depicting. (I have never written about fashion, but could tell you who and what was on Ms. Wintour's first Vogue cover.)</p><p>Adding to the fashion irony: The supposedly embarrassing outfits initially worn by the other central character, recent college grad Andy (Taylor Iman Jones)—who is hired, abandoning her ambitions to be a writer at a New Yorker-style magazine, to be Miranda's second assistant—are more on-trend and tasteful than those of almost everyone onstage. Her schoolgirl looks are redolent of Thom Browne (admittedly early, less freakish Browne), who has been a star in the fashion firmament for some time.</p><p>If I dwell on the costumes (by Arianne Phillips, or \"sourced\" by her) at great length, it is because fashion is central to the plot, but also the musical version of \"The Devil Wears Prada\" is a blandly workmanlike adaptation of its source material, which was none too rich to begin with. Ms. Weisberger's book was a prurient slog, and only a bestseller because Ms. Wintour is a famously private and forbidding figure. The movie was livelier, primarily due to the casting: Meryl Streep as Miranda, spitting ice chips in dulcet tones; Anne Hathaway as Andy; and Emily Blunt as Emily (here Megan Masako Haley), Miranda's first assistant. (Ms. Blunt stalked off with the movie, as if waltzing out of Bergdorf Goodman with the latest \"it\" bag on her arm.)</p><p>The musical follows dutifully in the stiletto-heeled footsteps of the movie. Andy, at first righteous and unhappy at Miranda's viperish, demanding ways, soon grows to appreciate the allurements of a job that gives her access to the upper echelons of New York society. Ms. Jones gives an appealing performance, and sings with lovely tone and polish, but her songs, generally ballads of ambivalence as she grows into her job and away from her aspiring-chef boyfriend, Nate (Michael Tacconi), do not give the character much definition.</p><p>As Miranda, Ms. Leavel is given some amusing Gilbert and Sullivan-style patter songs, wholly appropriate for a woman who is generally dictating her needs and wishes to people at a frenzied pace, and puts them across with wit and aplomb. The lyrics by Ms. Taub are among the more vividly amusing aspects of the show; Elton John's music, by contrast, feels rote. Certainly he is a master of all pop musical forms, and displays his fluency here, but the music mostly just drifts by, like generically chosen cellphone ring tones. (The choreography, by James Alsop, is frenetic music-video-style ambulatory posing.)</p><p>Ms. Shapiro, former artistic director of Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, here making her musical-theater debut, does not put any particular personal stamp on the material. The musical hits its predictable beats with a certain perfunctoriness: a big finish for the first act (at the Met Gala—or the Runway equivalent—Miranda orders Andy to tell Emily that she won't be coming to Paris), and an uplifting late song in which Andy reclaims her original ambitions.</p><p>In the supporting roles, Ms. Haley has some funny, pratfally moments as the ill-favored Emily, although—again—her faux-Chanel outfits are vulgar and wrong, and Ms. Wetherhead's book, while it has some bright bits of invention, doesn't provide her with the choice and moist material Ms. Blunt capitalized on in the movie. Christian Thompson, as the fancy writer and third point in the formulaically drawn love triangle involving Andy and Nate, wanders in and out briefly. Javier Muñoz, playing Andy's gay ally at Runway, gets the splashiest song, in which he upgrades Andy's look (for the worse, in truth), and another wry number in which he recalls what reading Runway meant to him as a tortured gay youth.</p><p>Notwithstanding the general polish of the production and the performances (I should note that the show is considered a work in progress, Covid-19 having wrought its usual havoc), the musical feels like a competent but uninspired knockoff, the theatrical equivalent of a fake Gucci bag that you'd find on Canal Street, snap up, and live to regret having bought.</p><p>Mr. Isherwood is the Journal's theater critic.</p><p>'The Devil Wears Prada' Review: Basic Bland</p>",
