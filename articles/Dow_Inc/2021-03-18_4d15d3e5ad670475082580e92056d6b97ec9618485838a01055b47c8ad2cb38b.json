  "text": "<p>   Shortages and transport bottlenecks have mounted world-wide for makers of everything from cars and clothing to home siding and medical-needle containers, with the extreme Texas weather and port backlogs compounding problems for manufacturers already beset by pandemic disruptions. </p><p>    Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. were the latest multinational companies to chime in about setbacks, with the two auto makers saying Wednesday they would halt production at plants in North America. Toyota cited a shortage of petrochemicals, manufacturing of which has been hobbled by last month's Texas freeze. Honda pointed to a combination of port issues, a semiconductor shortage, pandemic-related problems and the crippling U.S. weather. </p><p>   Samsung, the world's largest maker of smartphones, said the severe global shortage in chips would hurt its business into the next quarter. </p><p>   Global supply disruptions are creating cost increases and delays for numerous industries, company executives and analysts said, affecting profit margins and the prices that companies and consumers ultimately pay. </p><p>   \"We've been scrambling to get enough raw material,\" said Tom Nathanson, chief executive of Summit Plastics Inc.. He said the Mississippi company, which makes plastic sheeting for hospital gowns, packaging and other uses was already contending with supply-demand issues before the Texas cold spell. \"The costs have absolutely been passed on,\" Mr. Nathanson said. </p><p>   The disruptions, which come as the U.S. and some other economies are beginning to lurch toward normalcy, show how messy the reopening of business is proving to be a year after the pandemic's onset, and how vulnerable supply chains remain. </p><p>   The long-term economic impact remains unclear. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference Wednesday that he expects supply chains to adjust as economic growth accelerates. </p><p>   Last month's freeze in Texas was a severe blow. The state is home to the world's largest petrochemical complex, which turns oil and gas and its byproducts into plastics. The February freeze triggered mass blackouts that shuttered plants, many of which remain offline. </p><p>   \"What we saw with the freeze is we're one issue, one weather event away from supply-demand tightening operating rates, and so it doesn't take much to tilt the market,\" Howard Ungerleider, the chief financial officer of Dow Inc., said at a conference Tuesday. </p><p>   Several of Dow's petrochemical plants in Texas were forced to shut down during the freeze. Mr. Ungerleider said they would be running at 80% capacity by the end of March. </p><p>   He said plastic prices in Asia and Europe had already begun increasing due to supply shortfalls in the U.S. He estimated it would take more than six months to correct the supply-and-demand imbalances caused by the February storm. </p><p>   That assessment could be bad news for tent manufacturer Anchor Industries Inc., whose products are used for outdoor gatherings. The Indiana-based company is now having trouble getting polypropylene fastening straps, a normally cheap and readily available product, so instead has workers manually taping closed cardboard containers, a move that slowed shipments, said Mike McKim, purchasing manager. </p><p>   \"Texas came at just about the absolute worst time,\" added Mr. McKim, who said event planners are anticipating a surge of weddings this summer. \"Someone is going to be at the back of the line and not get what they need. We are just hoping it's not us.\" </p><p>   Samsung, also one of the world's largest chip makers, was forced to idle two chip factories in Austin, Texas, last month. The facilities represent about 28% of Samsung's total output, according to Citi analysts, and remained shut as of Wednesday. </p><p>   Toyota cited a petrochemicals shortage for curtailments at its factory in Kentucky, where it builds the Camry and Avalon sedans and the hybrid version of its RAV4 sport-utility vehicle. </p><p>   Meanwhile, the California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together handle more than a third of U.S. container imports, remain inundated from an inventory restocking drive that began late last year. </p><p>   Backlogs that at one point left some 40 vessels anchored offshore waiting for dock space have narrowed, but there were still 17 container ships waiting off the Southern California coast earlier this week. </p><p>   \"We've had cargo stuck in Los Angeles for months and we are now using airfreight for about a quarter of our volumes,\" adding to costs, said Abbie Durkin,  owner of Palmer &amp; Purchase, a women's clothing and accessories shop in Rye, N.Y. \"We will have to increase our prices starting in June.\" </p><p>   Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka expects little respite, with another 18 ships set to arrive at the complex by this weekend. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Dan Strumpf and Austen Hufford contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
