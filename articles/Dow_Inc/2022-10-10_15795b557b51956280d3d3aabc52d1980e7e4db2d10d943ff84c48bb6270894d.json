  "title": "Investing Monthly (A Special Report)  ---  Winners' Circle:  No. 1 Stock-Fund Manager  Gained 17.8% in Rough Year  ---  All but a handful of others finished in the red  ----  By Suzanne McGee",
  "text": "<p>   Many stock-fund managers can spin tales of how they triumphed over a bear market. Few, however, have encountered the kind of nightmare market they now are confronting. </p><p>   Only the most stubborn contrarians think that a lasting rebound has begun with the positive bounce taken in early October by U.S. stock indexes. Investors still face painful inflation, rising interest rates, nerve-racking volatility and geopolitical tensions. </p><p>   Perhaps it should come as little surprise, then, that during the latest period of The Wall Street Journal's Winners' Circle survey, the 12 months ended Sept. 30, a mere seven funds managed to post even tiny gains out of the 1,412 U.S. actively managed stock funds tracked. The average loss for funds in our survey was 19.4%; the S&amp;P 500 over the same period slumped 15.5%. (Funds in the survey must have assets in excess of $50 million, have a record of at least three years and meet a handful of other criteria as calculated by Morningstar Direct.) </p><p>   Of those elite few funds that did post gains, several pursued niche strategies. The No. 1 fund, Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities Fund (KSCOX), which gained 17.8%, and the No. 2 fund, Kinetics Paradigm Fund (WWNPX), which gained 11.4%, both maintained huge positions in the same single stock: Texas Pacific Land Corp., a real-estate enterprise whose shares soared nearly 47% in the quarter. Some 57% of the Small Cap Opportunities portfolio was in Texas Pacific Land, and 60.7% of the Paradigm fund. </p><p>    James Davolos, a portfolio manager at Horizon Kinetics LLC who serves on the investment committee for both funds, says such heavy exposure to a single stock didn't worry him. In Mr. Davolos's view, this is no time to be conducting business as usual. </p><p>   \"Modern portfolio management theory advocates diversification, arguing that it minimizes risk, but all it guarantees is earning a market return,\" Mr. Davolos says. \"Diversification just transfers risk, and reduces your ability to own good businesses that outperform.\" </p><p>   Mr. Davolos says that the recent buffeting of stocks and bonds is part of a massive economic and market transformation. </p><p>   \"We're transitioning from an era of abundance -- of labor, raw materials, capital -- to one of scarcity,\" he says. Nowhere is this trend more obvious than in the world of hard assets: energy and other commodities, agricultural products, infrastructure-related investments and land. \"Most wealth, over recorded history, has been stored in these assets,\" he says. </p><p>   Texas Pacific Land, one of the largest landowners in the state of Texas, embodies the kind of investment that Mr. Davolos says he now favors. It has expansive holdings and an attractive revenue stream from grazing rights, oil and gas royalties, and solar and wind power. It also extracts, stores and recycles water in a part of the country where companies are becoming increasingly anxious about this crucial raw material. </p><p>   Mr. Davolos says he's actively looking for other ways to invest in assets that people have become accustomed to thinking of as abundant. This category, he argues, not only will hold its value when inflation and higher interest rates wreak havoc on most other segments of the stock market, but offers the potential for solid outperformance over the coming decade. </p><p>   Wary investors might not back Mr. Davolos's outlook or investment strategy. Nor does The Wall Street Journal present this list of outperforming funds every quarter as a kind of shopping list for readers. When building a portfolio, investors should focus primarily on their individual objectives and risk tolerance. </p><p>   Few of this quarter's other outperforming managers share Mr. Davolos's willingness to allow a single stock to dictate portfolio returns, viewing it as risky. But they agree that the U.S. economy and stock market are in the midst of a secular shift, one that requires a reassessment of investment strategies. </p><p>   \"You have to ask, in a high-inflation environment, what do I want to own and what do I want to avoid?\" says Jeff Muhlenkamp, manager of this quarter's No. 3 fund, Muhlenkamp Fund (MUHLX). He posted an 8.8% return thanks to the resilience of holdings that he believes will continue to have pricing power regardless of the economic conditions ahead. </p><p>   Toward the end of 2021, Mr. Muhlenkamp began paring back his fund's stakes in companies such as Microsoft and Apple that had become -- in his eyes -- too pricey to hold on to in an environment shaped by high inflation and rising interest rates. The cash he raised he redeployed in his fund's positions in healthcare, oil-and-gas production and related service companies, chemical companies like Dow Inc., semiconductor manufacturers and mining. The largest position, in energy producer EQT Corp., is less than 4% of the fund's assets. </p><p>   Two funds posted modest gains for the quarter by concentrating on dividends. Investing in dividends has fallen out of favor in recent decades, as has investing in commodity producers and other hard assets. But there are still long-term believers in dividends, like John Kornitzer, manager of Buffalo Flexible Income Fund (BUFBX), No. 4 in our survey with a return of 1.8%, and Daniel Peris, who heads the team managing No. 5, Federated Hermes Strategic Value Dividend Fund (SVAIX), which posted a gain of 1.7%. </p><p>   \"I'm not Pollyanna-ish about a business slowdown, but we are comfortable with our ability to generate dividend yield and growth over time,\" Mr. Peris says. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. McGee is a writer in New England.
