  "title": "These high-yield stocks are down as much as 58% this year. But their inflation-fighting dividends have room to grow. Despite high inflation and recession fears, these companies are expected to keep generating plenty of cash to support even higher payouts.",
  "text": "<p>Below is a screen of stocks whose prices have declined at least 10% this year, but also have high dividend yields that appear well-supported by free cash flow over the next 12 months, based on analysts' estimates.</p><p>The MarketWatch U.S. Economic Calendar includes estimates for all major coming releases of government numbers, per economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal. Economists expect the Consumer Price Index for June to show a year-over-year increase of 8.8%, up from a 40-year high of 8.6% in May.</p><p>It's easy to say that if your dividend yield is lower than the CPI increase, you are losing buying power. Then again, nobody is affected by every element of the CPI index. You don't buy new cars continually, for example. Regardless, the higher the income, the better, especially if you need it now and have some comfort your payout won't be cut.</p><p>Dividend stock screen</p><p>The screen began with the S&amp;P 1500 Composite Index XX:SP1500, which is made up of the S&amp;P 500 SPX, the S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap Index MID and the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index SML.</p><p>Here's how the screen went:</p><p>* 96 of the stocks had dividend yields of at least 5.00% as of the close on July 11, according to data provided by FactSet.</p><p>* 71 of them had suffered price declines of at least 10% year-to-date.</p><p>* 48 of them have consensus estimates of free cash flow per share (or alternate figures) available for the next 12 months, from analysts polled by FactSet. The free-cash-flow estimates can be divided by the current share prices for estimated free cash flow yields. The FCF yields can be compared with the current yields to see if there is \"headroom\" to pay higher dividends. For many financial-services companies, especially banks and insurers, free cash flow estimates aren't available. But in these heavily regulated industries, earnings per share are considered to be a good indicator of how much of the cash being generated will be available to cover dividends, so we used consensus EPS estimates. For real estate investment trusts, FCF data isn't available. Instead, funds from operations (FFO), a non-GAAP measure widely accepted in the REIT industry to measure estimate dividend-paying ability, is used. FFO adds depreciation and amortization back to earnings, while netting out gains on the sale of real estate.</p><p>* 37 have estimated dividend \"headroom\" of at least 2.00%.</p><p>* 19 of these have had no dividend cuts over the past five years.</p><p>It may seem a bit harsh to exclude companies that cut their regular dividends at any time over the past five years because the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 were so dramatic. Then again, can you be sure the risk of another virus-driven downturn has been eliminated? Consider the risk to a REIT that owns hotel or retail properties.</p><p>Here are the 19 dividend stocks that passed the screen, sorted by dividend yield: </p><p> Company                                 Ticker   Industry                        Dividend yield   Estimated FCF yield   Estimated headroom   Price change – 2022 through July 11  Industrial Logistics Properties Trust   ILPT     REIT                            9.48%            12.45%                2.97%                -44%  Brandywine Realty Trust                 BDN      REIT                            8.40%            15.46%                7.07%                -33%  SL Green Realty Corp.
