  "title": "The 'Clean Power Plan' Returns",
  "text": "<p>This is a national renewable-energy mandate on the sly. Utilities would have to buy or generate a certain amount of renewable energy each year. Those that don't meet their quotas would be fined while those that exceed targets would receive payments from the feds that they must spend on increasing renewable energy or reducing electricity prices.</p><p>An honest national renewables mandate would run afoul of budget reconciliation rules. But the liberal outfit ThirdWay says the Clean Electricity Payment Program \"is a purely budgetary proposal (involving only spending and revenue) as opposed to a regulatory approach\" and \"the enforcement mechanism is simply payments and fees.\" Therefore it can dodge a Senate filibuster.</p><p>The idea resembles the Obama Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, which required states to reduce CO2 grid emissions by shutting down coal plants and using more renewables. The Supreme Court blocked the EPA rule in 2016 after states argued it violated the Clean Air Act and unconstitutionally conscripted them.</p><p>Now Democrats plan to conscript utilities instead. But make no mistake: Their plan would require the two dozen or so GOP-led states that don't have renewable mandates to adopt them. It would also force states to prematurely shut down fossil-fuel plants that provide reliable baseload power and stick their citizens with the costs.</p><p>Democrats claim the plan gives utilities flexibility since hydropower, nuclear and carbon capture would count toward renewable quotas. But they know new hydropower dams, nuclear plants and carbon capture aren't currently feasible. See Southern Company's Vogtle nuclear facilities in Georgia and its Kemper carbon-capture fossil fuel plant.</p><p>Democrats also say government payments to utilities will offset the cost of renewables. \"To protect electricity customers, performance payments (coupled with clean electricity tax credits for generators) shift the cost of this once-in-a-generation transition to the more progressive federal tax base,\" a plan fact sheet says.</p><p>Translation: Democrats will raise taxes to finance the new green grid and then give some companies tax credits for investing in renewable energy. Coerce with mandates and taxes and subsidize politically favored behavior.</p><p>The more utilities rely on renewables, the more backup power they need from fossil fuels to keep the grid stable. To prevent rolling blackouts this summer, California has approved five new natural-gas plants and hefty payments to businesses to run on their fossil-fuel backup generators when electricity supply is tight.</p><p>Dow Inc. CEO Jim Fitterling warned last week that the Democrats' plan could raise energy costs, especially for manufacturers, and render the grid less reliable. He's right, and all Americans will pay.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
