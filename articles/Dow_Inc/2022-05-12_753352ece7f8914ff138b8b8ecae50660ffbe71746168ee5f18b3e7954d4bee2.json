  "title": "Lombard Odier Partnership Seeks $500 Million for Curbing Plastics Pollution; The Geneva investment firm is teaming with Dow Inc. and a nonprofit on a private-equity strategy aimed at reducing plastic waste",
  "text": "<p>Geneva-based Lombard Odier, which oversees some 71 billion Swiss francs, or around $71.31 billion, of assets, will manage the strategy with support from the Alliance.</p><p>\"The main role of the Alliance is really twofold,\" Mr. Duer said. \"On one hand, it's to provide investment opportunities for the fund, recognizing that we are developing solutions that can be taken to scale. It's also for the Alliance to serve [in] a technical advisory function to the fund, recognizing that we have significant knowledge and experience in the space around plastic waste and plastic waste recycling.\"</p><p>The nonprofit's members have already funded grants and projects around the globe supporting efforts to reduce plastic waste such as recycling centers and plants, as well as producing recycled construction materials. The Alliance also works with Plug and Play LLC, a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based startup incubator that connects financiers, corporations, governments and organizations with startups across different industries.</p><p>The new strategy managed by Lombard Odier aims to invest directly in companies world-wide along themes that include plastic waste collection and sorting infrastructure, as well as technology to improve plastic durability, reuse and recyclability, according to a news release.</p><p>The partnership will typically look to invest $15 million to $25 million at a time on its own and alongside other investors, and will focus exclusively on plastic waste-reduction strategies, according to Jean-Pascal Porcherot, co-head of Lombard Odier Investment Managers.</p><p>The partnership stands to benefit from an increased focus among large corporations on reducing their carbon emissions and enhancing environmental sustainability, according to Jim Fitterling, chairman of the Alliance and Dow's chief executive.</p><p>Mr. Fitterling said a growing number of manufacturers have set aggressive sustainability targets they want to reach by 2030 that combined would generate as much as 7.5 million tons of additional demand for recycled plastics.</p><p>\"That's a very substantial change in what's happened in the market and that's just over the last two or three years,\" he said.</p><p>The partnership is part of a small but growing universe of investment managers focused at least in part on investing to reduce plastic waste. In late 2019, Circulate Capital raised $106 million for a fund focused on reducing ocean plastic waste in South and Southeast Asia. New York-based Closed Loop Partners last year formed the Closed Loop Circular Plastics Fund with $25 million in initial commitments to support the recovery and recycling of plastics in the U.S. and Canada through debt and equity investments.</p><p>They are among investment managers targeting the so-called circular economy, which seeks to eliminate waste, reuse products and materials, and regenerate natural systems. An estimated 30 private-market funds, including private-equity, venture and debt strategies, focused on the circular economy in the first half of 2020, compared with three in 2016, according to a 2020 report from the nonprofit Ellen MacArthur Foundation.</p><p>\"There's so much to get done in this space at a certain pace and speed and therefore there are really opportunities for these different funds not only to complement each other but also benefit from each other through the partnerships,\" Mr. Duer said.</p><p>Write to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
