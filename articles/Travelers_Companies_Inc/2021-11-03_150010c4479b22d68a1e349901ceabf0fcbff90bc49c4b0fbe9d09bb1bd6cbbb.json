  "title": "At MetLife, Life Insurance Claims Rise for Younger People Dying From Covid-19; Allstate reports 55% decline in profit due to supply-chain inflation and growing wreck volume",
  "text": "<p>The high level of death-benefit payout was more than offset by unusually strong investment gains from the small slice of the insurer's investment portfolio held in private-equity funds. The New York company more than doubled its net income and posted a 31% increase in its adjusted earnings.</p><p>Allstate Corp., meanwhile, reported a 55% drop in net income.</p><p>\"The story of the quarter is supply-chain-driven loss-cost inflation,\" said Allstate financial chief Mario Rizzo in an interview. \"We along with the rest of the industry have really seen a rapid escalation in the cost to repair cars and homes.\"</p><p>The company noted, in particular, price increases for used cars and original equipment parts, and higher materials and labor costs on the homeowners side of the company.</p><p>Allstate also cited higher losses tied to higher auto-accident frequency. In the year-earlier quarter, car insurers benefited from an unusually low level of vehicle crashes as pandemic-related business shutdowns and work-from-home arrangements led to a drop in miles driven.</p><p>As of this year's second quarter, U.S. car insurers began facing tougher year-over-year comparisons, as drivers returned to the nation's roads again in large numbers.</p><p>Life insurers invest customers' premiums until needed to pay claims, and they hold the majority of money in high-quality bonds. MetLife and some others allocate a small slice to private-equity funds for extra yield.</p><p>At MetLife, a double-digit-percentage increase in its net investment income helped its net income to more than double to $1.52 billion and helped fuel a 31% increase in adjusted earnings to $2.1 billion, which Wall Street analysts track as a measure of recurring earnings.</p><p>The gains occurred even as adjusted earnings in its U.S. group-benefits business slid 72% to $111 million, a result of the Covid-19 deaths as well as dental use returning to a normal level.</p><p>MetLife's Covid-19 details followed reports of elevated deaths at other insurers including Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc.</p><p>Insurers say that the Delta variant claimed more lives than in previous quarters of people younger than 65 years. As a result, more victims were in the workforce and held employer-sponsored policies. Such policies typically pay a death benefit of at least as much as the employee's annual pay. MetLife and Prudential also both reported higher Covid-19-related payouts in their international life-insurance businesses.</p><p>MetLife paid out $1.06 for each $1 of premium it collected in its group-life-insurance business. In contrast, it paid out 96.3 cents in last year's fourth quarter.</p><p>In general, U.S. life insurers last year paid out far fewer Covid-19 death claims than initially expected, largely because the virus was then disproportionately killing people with little to no insurance. These included minority Americans and older people, who often have smaller policies than people still in the workforce. Younger people typically buy policies to protect spouses and children against the loss of a breadwinner's income.</p><p>Allstate's quarterly net profit fell to $508 million, a decline primarily driven by higher losses in its car- and home-insurance operations, partially offset by a $300 million increase in net investment income.</p><p>Allstate said catastrophe losses were $1.27 billion in the third quarter, after accounting for reinsurance, up from $990 million. Three-fourths of them were related to its homeowners insurance. The largest event was Hurricane Ida.</p><p>For car insurers, Covid 19's impact has been felt in Americans' changed driving patterns. While there is reduced commuting as many work-from-home arrangements continue, more people are running errands and taking trips, Travelers Cos. Inc. said in its third-quarter earnings call.</p><p>Allstate said that miles driven were rebounding \"toward pre-pandemic levels.\" While accident frequency increased relative to the year before, it remains below pre-pandemic levels, Allstate said.</p><p>Both Allstate and Travelers said they are seeking premium-rate increases.</p><p>Many insurers provided financial-relief programs as claims plunged under shelter-at-home restrictions. Some regulators and consumer advocates contend they didn't refund enough money. In early October, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara ordered Allstate, among others, to reimburse Californians for the excess premiums his department calculates they were charged, or face legal action. Insurers must respond by later this week. Allstate's Mr. Rizzo said the insurer has \"an active dialogue going\" with the department.</p><p>Write to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com</p><p>At MetLife, Life Insurance Claims Rise for Younger People Dying From Covid-19</p>",
