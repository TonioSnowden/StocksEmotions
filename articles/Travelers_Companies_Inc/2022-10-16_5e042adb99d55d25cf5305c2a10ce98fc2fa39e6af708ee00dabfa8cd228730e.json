  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>Or should that be the week of the workers? The 20th <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9946ebdc-8b42-47d9-b3ef-6fb3762fbf2c\">national congress</a> of the Chinese Communist party is under way in Beijing and all eyes are on President Xi Jinping ahead of the expected vote to hand him an unprecedented third term in office. The FT has spoken with more than two dozen business executives, farmers, government officials and Chinese academics — although, understandably, none would go on the record — to give a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e60a61b3-f043-43c2-a840-b3d3fba3237f\">broad picture of the country</a> as it enters this new era.</p> <p>Back in the UK, representatives of British workers will gather in Brighton for the annual TUC Congress, which was rescheduled due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II last month. Given the state of the economy and industrial unrest, there will be much to discuss. Pensions, the cost of living crisis and defending the right to strike are all <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/Congress2022/programme-business-2022\">on the agenda</a>.</p> <p>Economic troubles will be high on the agenda for the European Council meeting between EU heads of state, which begins on Thursday in Brussels.</p> <p>The fallout from the January 6 2021 attack on Capitol Hill continues to grab headlines in the US. On Friday, Donald Trump's former political adviser Steve Bannon is due to be sentenced for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbc4510f-4623-4d0f-9d8a-11c079e59fbf\">contempt of Congress</a> after failing to comply with a subpoena issued by the committee investigating the attack. He faces a fine of between $100 and $100,000 as well as a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail for each count.</p> <p>Finally, among the anniversaries this week is a significant one for a British institution as the BBC turns 100. Many people will have a view on this. Perhaps it is time to review former <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18881a2e-63f8-4f66-9a5f-ac0c8ae0c552\">FT editor Lionel Barber's take</a> on a century of “Auntie Beeb”.</p> <p>What events are concerning you in the coming seven days?

Thank you.</p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>It's going to be another difficult week for economic data, but then these are the times we are in. </p> <p>UK inflation figures for September are likely to see another rise in the headline rate back in double digits, while the GfK confidence reading and retail sales update will probably underline how unlikely a consumer-led recovery is at the moment. Plus, on Friday, S&amp;P will review the UK's credit rating of AA (currently with a negative outlook) as will Moody's. Another Friday that is unlikely to be quiet for the British press.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve will on Wednesday publish its latest Beige Book, providing commentary on current US economic conditions, and there will be an update on the increasingly fragile American housing market.</p> <p>China's monthly activity indicators will most likely illustrate the impact of Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>We're deep into the earnings season, starting the week with the rest of the big Wall Street banks reporting third-quarter numbers, followed by a mixture of consumer goods, retail, media, airlines and tech.</p> <p>Higher costs are hitting online retailers. <strong>Naked Wines</strong>, which reports interims on Monday, shocked the markets last month when it reported a change in strategy towards profitability. <strong>Asos</strong> will present full-year earnings on Friday, the first under the tenure of chief executive José Antonio Ramos Calamonte, but has already warned that these will be at the bottom of expectations due to cutbacks in consumer spending.</p> <p>Investors in UK residential housebuilder <strong>Bellway</strong> will be looking at the future given concerns about the impact of rising borrowing costs on the British housing market. The order book stood at £2.1bn in August, but more recent trading patterns and levels of sales interest will be key, alongside any signs of stress in the mortgage market.</p> <h1>Key economic and company reports</h1> <p>Here is a more complete list of what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>New Zealand, Q3 consumer price index inflation rate data</p></li>  <li><p>UK, a government consultation on a new legal framework for defined benefit pension schemes, including a set of rules for funding and investment strategies, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d460812-374b-4985-8204-626ce8bc2fbc\">closes today</a>.
