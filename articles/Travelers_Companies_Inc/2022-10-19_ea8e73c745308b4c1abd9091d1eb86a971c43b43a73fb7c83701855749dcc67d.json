  "text": "<p>Stocks have been boosted in recent days, driven by better-than-expected quarterly results from large U.S. banks.</p><p>\"The numbers coming through on the earnings are more positive than expectations. That's giving a short term momentum,\" said Niall O'Sullivan, chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at Neuberger Berman.</p><p>\"But actions you would expect to see in the early stages of a recession are being taken\" such as hiring freezes, \"which maybe speak to a more challenging environment coming,\" Mr. O'Sullivan said.</p><p>In premarket trading, Netflix jumped more than 14% after it said it gained 2.4 million new subscribers last quarter, more than double the level it was expecting. United Airlines rose 7% after it said demand for air travel is resilient and that it expects a profit margin to rise beyond prepandemic levels by the end of the year.</p><p>Companies including consumer-goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble, insurer Travelers Companies and pharmaceutical firm Abbott Laboratories are scheduled to report earnings ahead of the opening bell. Reports from Tesla and IBM are expected after markets close.</p><p>Markets calming in the U.K. after a period of high volatility also contributed to broader sentiment. The Bank of England's recent bond-market intervention was taken as a sign that central banks can still act to stabilize markets in times of crisis, despite high inflation, investors said.</p><p>Data on the housing market are set to go out at 8:30 a.m. ET, with housing starts expected to have declined in September from the prior month.</p><p>Oil prices edged up, with global crude benchmark Brent climbing 0.9% to trade at $90.85 a barrel. Traders are weighing the potential impact of the Biden administration planning to sell more oil from strategic reserves with the aim of lowering prices.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged up to 4.065% from 3.996% the day before. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.2%. Dutch semiconductor firm ASML Holding climbed 8% after reporting a narrower drop in profit last quarter, driven by record bookings.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks retreated. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 2.4%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise Ahead of Earnings</p>",
