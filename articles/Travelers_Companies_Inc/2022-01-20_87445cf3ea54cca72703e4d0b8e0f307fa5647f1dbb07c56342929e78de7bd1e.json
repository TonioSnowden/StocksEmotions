  "title": "Stock Futures Rise After Nasdaq Enters Correction; Technology-heavy index closed more than 10% below its all-time high",
  "text": "<p>Earnings were in focus again, with results due from The Travelers Companies and American Airlines Group before markets open. Netflix will be one of the first tech giants to post its fourth-quarter results, after markets close, when PPG Industries will also report.</p><p>Faced with the prospect of multiple interest rate increases, cooling economic growth and inflation which has soared to multidecade highs, investors have begun 2022 by reassessing the pandemic-era playbook that focused heavily on outsize gains for growth stocks, such as tech. In recent sessions, investors have rotated money out of fast-growing tech firms and into sectors expected to perform better in the coming year, such as financials and energy.</p><p>\"I don't see a whole lot in the market that is really alarming me. There is no one out there saying 'run for the hills,' but there are those saying they are going to take off risk and reposition to other areas of the market,\" said Kara Murphy, chief investment officer of Kestra Holdings.</p><p>That has prompted tumultuous trading for major indexes. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite closed more than 10% below its all-time closing high, putting it into what is considered correction territory for a stock index.</p><p>Investors are selling government bonds in anticipation of higher interest rates, pushing up bond yields and in the process, pressuring shares in tech companies, whose future earnings become less attractive when compared with bonds with rising yields.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.835% Thursday from 1.826% Wednesday, after rising steadily in recent weeks. Benchmark German bund yields fell further into negative territory, a day after they briefly turned positive for the first time since 2019. The yield on the 10-year German government bond fell to minus 0.023% Thursday from minus 0.014% Wednesday.</p><p>Weekly jobless claims data are due at 8:30 a.m. ET, and investors are also awaiting data on the housing market, a bright spot for the economy. The data, due at 10 a.m. ET, is expected to show that existing home sales slowed in December, but were still on track for the best year since 2006.</p><p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 0.5% to $88.03 a barrel. This follows a rally partly driven by the potential for supply disruptions in Russia and the Middle East. On Wednesday, Brent crude futures hit their highest level since October 2014.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.2%, while Asian stock markets were mixed. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 rose 1.1%.</p><p>Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks jumped after an interest-rate cut by China's central bank lifted shares of property developers and tech giants. The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.4%. Mainland China's Shanghai Composite Index edged down 0.1%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise After Nasdaq Enters Correction</p>",
