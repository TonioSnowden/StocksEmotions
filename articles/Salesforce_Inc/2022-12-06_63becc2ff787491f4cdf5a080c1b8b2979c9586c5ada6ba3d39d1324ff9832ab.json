  "title": "Slack Co-Founder Butterfield to  Leave Parent Company Salesforce  ----  By Will Feuer",
  "text": "<p>    Salesforce Inc. said Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive and co-founder of the messaging app Slack Technologies, plans to leave the company next month. </p><p>   The news of Mr. Butterfield's departure comes after Salesforce said last week that co-CEO Bret Taylor would depart the company in January, leaving Chairman Marc Benioff the sole CEO of the company he co-founded. Mr. Taylor was credited as the architect of Salesforce's 2020 deal to buy Slack for $27.7 billion, Salesforce's biggest acquisition ever. </p><p>   Mr. Butterfield will be succeeded by Lidiane Jones, a current Salesforce cloud executive, as the next Slack CEO, a spokeswoman said. Insider previously reported Mr. Butterfield's plans to depart. </p><p>   In an internal message viewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Butterfield told Salesforce employees that Slack's chief product officer and another executive, its senior vice president of marketing communications and brand, also are leaving, though he described the timing as coincidental. He also said the moves are unrelated to Mr. Taylor's departure. </p><p>   Mr. Butterfield said he is leaving the company in good shape. </p><p>   \"That's not to say there won't be challenges ahead,\" he said. \"We're at a time with an unusual amount of economic uncertainty and there's no doubt that makes things harder.\" </p><p>   The acquisition of Slack, almost twice as large as Salesforce's next-biggest acquisition, marked an effort to move Salesforce beyond its core product, which helps companies manage their customer relationships, to providing the software tools that businesses need for a swath of their day-to-day operations. </p><p>   The deal also was a bet that at least some of the changes in the workplace made over the past three years would outlast the pandemic. \"We really see the world as fundamentally having shifted,\" Mr. Taylor, then-chief operating officer of Salesforce, said of the deal in 2020. </p><p>   Salesforce and other business-software companies have indicated in recent earnings announcements that customers are being more cautious with their spending in response to a challenging economy, adding to the tech industry's concerns. </p><p>   Salesforce, Okta Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and others say customers are taking longer to sign deals, and slowing their hiring plans as they try to protect their bottom lines. That trend has created a clouded outlook for many in the once-booming business-software sector, which benefited from years of demand as customers looked to use the products to trim costs and maintain their businesses during the pandemic. </p><p>   In its announcement last week, Salesforce missed analysts' expectations for billings, a measure of business actually transacted during the period, by roughly 8%. </p><p>   Salesforce shares fell more than 7% to $133.93 by the close of the market Monday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down nearly 2%. Salesforce's stock is down 47.3% this year. </p><p></p>",
