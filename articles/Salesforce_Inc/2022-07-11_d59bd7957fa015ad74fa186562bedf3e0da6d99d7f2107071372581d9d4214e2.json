  "title": "Businesses Urge SEC to Consider Mergers in Climate-Disclosure Rule; Deals could be delayed or scrapped if buyers are forced to report on acquisitions' climate risks and emissions without having the time to integrate them, executives and lawyers say",
  "text": "<p>The SEC in March proposed requiring public companies to report their carbon emissions and, in certain cases, those of their suppliers and customers. The comment period on the proposal closed in mid-June and the regulator considers companies' views in crafting the final rule.</p><p>Depending on what the final version says, climate-related disclosures could extend the due-diligence period or make a deal less appealing overall if buyers are forced to report on acquired businesses without having the time to fully integrate them into their financial statements, executives and lawyers said.</p><p>The proposal has attracted widespread criticism from businesses, while Republican lawmakers and law professors are questioning whether the regulator has the legal authority to set such a rule. The SEC declined to comment on whether it is making changes to the proposal or when it plans to publish a final rule.</p><p>Companies including online marketplace Etsy Inc., apparel retailer Gap Inc., ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. and business-software provider Salesforce Inc. wrote letters to the SEC voicing their concerns about the proposed rule, including increased costs and a lack of clarity around the threshold for certain disclosures.</p><p>Deal making soared in 2021 due to a flood of private-equity funding and low interest rates, but it has slowed in recent months as the economic outlook darkened. Companies world-wide struck deals valued at a combined $2.17 trillion during the first six months of the year, down 21% from the prior-year period, according to Refinitiv, a data provider.</p><p>Having to disclose climate risks and emissions for acquired companies \"adds another layer\" to the M&amp;A process, said Debra Gatison Hatter, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP.</p><p>Conducting due diligence on a target company can easily take between one and three months, depending on the type of deal, Ms. Hatter said. Figuring out whether or not a target collects the required information and potentially remediating that could extend the time frame by several weeks or more, Ms. Hatter said.</p><p>The SEC's proposed rule didn't specify when companies would have to start reporting the greenhouse-gas emissions of a newly acquired business. In the proposal, the regulator asked whether it should offer disclosure relief for certain recently acquired companies, for example by not mandating the disclosures until the first fiscal year after the year in which a deal closes.</p><p>Amy Weaver, chief financial officer of Salesforce, in a June 15 letter said the SEC shouldn't require reporting on emissions from acquisitions in the year a deal closes. This relief would \"be akin to the current one-year exemption from Sarbanes-Oxley and internal controls over financial reporting for recently acquired entities,\" Ms. Weaver said. Salesforce didn't respond to a request for additional comment.</p><p>Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Etsy in a June 16 letter said companies should be permitted to exclude an acquired business from their climate disclosures for at least 12 months after a deal closes. Without this kind of reprieve, companies might rethink the timing of a deal or abandon it altogether, said Rachel Glaser, Etsy's finance chief.</p><p>The company has for years voluntarily provided disclosures on certain emissions, but it takes time to incorporate an acquired business into existing reporting frameworks, Ms. Glaser said. Etsy, which in July 2021 completed the $1.6 billion acquisition of U.K.-based shopping app Depop, is still working on integrating the company into its reporting on environmental, social and governance issues, the CFO said. \"We do need some time to be able to get the reporting processes up and running, to be able to audit them and get them into our public filings,\" Ms. Glaser said, referring to acquisition targets.</p><p>By the time the deal was completed, Depop had already accounted for its carbon emissions for the first six months of 2021, said Chelsea Mozen, senior director of impact and sustainability at Etsy. But Depop's way wasn't the same as Etsy's, and for its auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to sign off on the information, the methodology had to be exactly the same, Ms. Mozen said.</p><p>Another unanswered question for executives is whether the SEC will require companies to provide historical emission information. The proposal asks companies to disclose this data for their most recent fiscal year and for prior fiscal years included in consolidated financial statements, which is often three years.</p><p>Demanding historical data would significantly affect deal-making analysis, said Cynthia Mabry, a partner at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP. Buyers would have to assess what information is available, how far back it goes and whether a company might be exempted from having to provide such data if it doesn't exist, Ms. Mabry said.</p><p>Already, ESG considerations including climate risks are factoring into M&amp;A activity. More than half of M&amp;A executives see the ESG performance of a target as justifying higher valuations or expect this to be the case in the future, according to a survey of 281 corporate decision makers by consulting firm Bain &amp; Co. While just 11% said they extensively assess such factors on a regular basis in the deal-making process, 65% expect their company's focus on ESG to increase, the survey showed.</p><p>Companies are looking to do deals in part to help them achieve their ESG-related goals, said Debra McCoy, global lead for capital markets, sustainability and ESG at Bain. But reporting emissions information is a significant undertaking, she said.</p><p>This includes details about potential deal targets, Ms. McCoy said. \"Emissions reporting for an entity that they don't yet know but are acquiring would rightly raise questions\" about when and what executives will be able to report on that new business, she said.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Williams-Alvarez at jennifer.williams-alvarez@wsj.com</p><p>Businesses Urge SEC to Consider Mergers in Climate-Disclosure Rule</p>",
