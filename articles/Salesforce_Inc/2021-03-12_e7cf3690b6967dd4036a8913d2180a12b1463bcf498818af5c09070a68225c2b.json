  "title": "MANSION  ---  Private Properties:  A Megabuilder's  Houston Mansion  ----  By Katherine Clarke",
  "text": "<p>   In Houston, a sprawling Mediterranean-style mansion designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects is coming on the market for $34.5 million. </p><p>   If it sold for close to its asking price, the property would be the most expensive ever sold in the area, according to the listing agent. </p><p>   Named Adagio, which translates from Italian to \"at a slow tempo,\" the roughly 17,000-square-foot main house was designed to look like a Tuscan-style villa with terracotta roof tiles and white columns. Inside, it unfolds as a series of unusual spaces: There is a burgundy-paneled library with leather-tiled floors, an oval formal dining room with french doors leading onto a terrace, and a bathroom suite with a domed ceiling and elaborate plasterwork designed to look like pleated drapery. </p><p>   The living room has Venetian-plastered walls interspersed with columns and pilasters with stylized Egyptian-cartouche details and gilt edging. There is also a white-marble mantelpiece with Greco Roman figures. </p><p>   The house was built for the late billionaire builder Gerald Hines and his wife Barbara Hines, who commissioned Robert A.M. Stern Architects to design the five-bedroom home more than three decades ago, Ms. Hines said. The house was completed around 1992. </p><p>   \"When we traveled, what we enjoyed most of all was combining outdoor life with indoor life, as you do in the south of France or Italy,\" said Ms. Hines. \"We decided we would do a beautiful patio and combine the best of Italy with the Houston weather.\" </p><p>   The couple filled the home with antique furniture and art, piecing an extensive collection together from their travels and from auctions. In the living room, a period Bechstein piano is clad in a gold trim, while a gold Rococo desk stands by the wall. In the more casual family room, the fireplace has an unusual mantel featuring a collection of ceremonial maces. Ms. Hines said she hasn't yet decided on whether she will sell the furniture. </p><p>   The roughly 4 1/2-acre property, which also includes a garden atrium with a pool, a tennis court and sprawling manicured gardens, is on Lazy Lane Boulevard, a tony street that backs onto the River Oaks Country Club and is one of the most expensive residential corridors in the country. </p><p>   Mr. Hines died last year at age 95. He was the chairman of real-estate giant Hines, which he founded in 1957. His company developed some of the world's best-known commercial skyscrapers, including the Lipstick Building in Manhattan, the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco and the Williams Tower and Bank of America Plaza in Houston. Over the years, Mr. Hines worked with architects like I.M. Pei and Cesar Pelli. </p><p>   Ms. Hines said she is selling the property since it is too large for only her. Cathy Cagle and Patricia Reed of Douglas Elliman have the listing. </p><p></p>",
