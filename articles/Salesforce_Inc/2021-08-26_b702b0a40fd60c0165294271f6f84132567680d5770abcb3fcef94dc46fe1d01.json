  "text": "<p>How stock benchmarks are trading</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was down 63.64 points, or 0.2%, at 35,341.86.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 10.62 points, or 0.2%, to 4,485.57.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP was off 25.44 points, or 0.2%, at 15,016.42.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>Stocks looked vulnerable to a pullback after the major equity indexes climbed for at least four consecutive days, registering a series of records. A pair of deadly bombings outside of the Kabul airport may have also affected risk tolerance and contributed to some selling pressure, analysts said.</p><p>In economic data, the Labor Department said first-time jobless claims rose 4,000 last week to 353,000, slightly above forecasts for a reading of 350,000 after dipping to a pandemic low in the previous week.</p><p>A second estimate of U.S. gross domestic product, the official scorecard of U.S. economic expansion, showed annualized growth of 6.6%, compared with an initial reading of 6.5%.

However, expectations that Powell will use the venue as an opportunity to broach the subject of tapering have diminished since last week amid the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of COVID-19.</p><p>Kansas City Fed President Esther George, in a Thursday television interview, said she backed tapering the central bank's asset purchases “sooner rather than later.” In a separate interviews, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Dalles Fed President Robert Kaplan reiterated calls to begin tapering asset purchases.</p><p>Meanwhile, the spread of the delta variant has led Bank of America to lower its year-end forecast on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;to 1.55%.</p><p>“We came into 2021 with a 10Y year-end target of 1.5% but subsequently revised higher to eventually above 2% after the Democratic clean sweep, vaccine progress and sharp upward revision of economic expectations from our U.S. economists. We now return nearly full circle,” wrote analysts led by Mark Cabana.</p><p>“We are forced to acknowledge that the delta variant has caused a considerable reassessment of the economic outlook as priced in by rates markets globally,” he wrote.</p><p>Analysts noted, however, that a range of high-frequency data have so far indicated the spread of the delta variant has had only a modest impact on economic activity.</p><p>Also see:Stock-market investors search alternative data for signs the delta variant is slowing the economy</p><p>In other news, two suicide bombers and gunmen targeted crowds gathered near the Kabul airport Thursday. At least 13 people were killed and 15 wounded, Russian officials said.</p><p>Also read: Investors ignore Afghanistan, but risk levels are on the rise</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Dow component Salesforce.com Inc. CRM rose 5% after the cloud-based customer-relationship management company hiked its forecast for the year yet again late Wednesday, following a strong quarter when it closed on its acquisition of Slack Technologies Inc.</p><p>Dollar General Corp. DG stock fell 0.8%, after the discount retailer reported second-quarter income that beat the Street but fell versus 2020.</p><p>Shares of Dollar Tree Inc.DLTR fell more than 11%, after reporting second-quarter sales that came in short of expectations.</p><p>Shares of J.M.
