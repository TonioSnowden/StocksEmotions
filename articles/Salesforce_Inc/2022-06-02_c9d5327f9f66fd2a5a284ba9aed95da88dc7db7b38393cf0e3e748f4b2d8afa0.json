  "title": "How a Strong Dollar Hits Microsoft, Other Big U.S. Companies; A more valuable dollar is a benefit for U.S. consumers but makes it harder for companies to cash in on foreign sales",
  "text": "<p>The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, has risen roughly 13% over the past year, defying strong inflation to reach levels not seen since the early 2000s.</p><p>In part, that is because investors around the world have been drawn to the U.S. as a source of relative economic strength and stability. Russia's war in Ukraine and China's Covid-19 resurgence have rattled markets, hitting supplies of key commodities and lifting energy prices in a threat to economies world-wide.</p><p>When investing in U.S. stocks and bonds, foreigners must usually use dollars, driving up the currency.</p><p>What are the consequences of a stronger U.S. dollar?</p><p>A stronger national currency has benefits and drawbacks for the country that issues it. On the plus side, Americans are seeing their money go farther when they buy goods and services from overseas. Imports become cheaper. A cup of espresso in Paris or a bowl of noodles in Tokyo cost less, in dollar terms, than before.</p><p>On the other hand, the stronger dollar means that American products are less affordable to foreigners. That makes it harder for people from other countries to visit the U.S., hurting hotels and other tourist-dependent industries. By the same token, the dollar's strength also cuts into international sales for all kinds of American businesses.</p><p>Why is Microsoft suffering?</p><p>As a global provider of everything from office software and cloud-computing services to laptops and videogame consoles, Microsoft gets most of its profits from abroad. In the latest fiscal year, the company's pretax foreign income was $36.1 billion, compared with $35 billion domestically. That outsize share of international business means that a strengthening dollar weighs on the company's operations.</p><p>In April, the rising dollar was already rearing its head as a concern. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told analysts that in the latest fiscal quarter, foreign-exchange effects reduced the company's sales by $302 million. Total revenue in the quarter was $49.4 billion.</p><p>On Wednesday, Microsoft sent up another red flag about the impact of dollar strength, cutting its outlook for revenue and profit. The company told investors that it now expects foreign-exchange moves to reduce sales by $460 million more than it had previously anticipated in the current quarter. Profit will suffer too, Microsoft warned.</p><p>What are other companies saying?</p><p>A variety of U.S. companies that sell products abroad face a similar dynamic. Other technology companies are a prime example. Salesforce Inc. cited the dollar's strength this week when it cut its annual sales outlook, doubling its estimate of the projected currency impact on revenue to $600 million.</p><p>Drug companies that sell medicine and medical products in international markets have also taken a hit. In late April, pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc. said foreign-exchange effects dented sales by 1.3% in the first quarter of this yearâ€”and that was before the dollar crested at recent highs last month. For the full year, AbbVie forecast that the rising dollar would hurt sales by 1.4%.</p><p>Manufacturers with big export markets are another potential victim. Last month, Deere &amp; Co., a maker of farm and construction equipment, also warned a stronger dollar would likely hurt its sales.</p><p>Which other businesses are investors watching?</p><p>Companies with large sources of foreign revenue are already taking a hit in stock markets.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 Foreign Revenue Exposure Index has dropped around 17% so far this year, compared with the broad S&amp;P 500 index's 13% decline. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 U.S. Revenue Exposure Index, which includes companies more dependent on domestic sales, has lost just 7%.</p><p>Among the big names in the index more exposed to overseas money: Microsoft, Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., chip maker Nvidia Corp., Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. , the holding company for Facebook. Other key companies include drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson and credit-card company Mastercard Inc.</p><p>The U.S.-revenue index, on the other hand, suggests some corporate names that could be more insulated. Those include health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. and telecoms giant Verizon Communications Inc. Big U.S.-centric retailers like Home Depot Inc. and Walmart Inc. also make that list.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>How a Strong Dollar Hits Microsoft, Other Big U.S. Companies</p>",
