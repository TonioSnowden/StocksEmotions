  "title": "Technology:  Innovator Takes Center Stage With Two Companies  ----  By Aaron Tilley and Georgia Wells",
  "text": "<p>   Bret Taylor has been involved with some of the tech industry's most notable innovations -- from Google Maps to Facebook's \"like\" button -- and founded companies that sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. </p><p>   But until recently, the 41-year-old Oakland, Calif., native was largely unknown outside Silicon Valley. Then, within a couple of days at the end of November, Mr. Taylor was named to help run two of tech's most prominent companies, as board chairman of  Twitter  Inc. and co-chief executive of Salesforce.com Inc. </p><p>   \"It was an unusual week in my life,\" Mr. Taylor said. </p><p>   The promotions catapult the engineer by training into the spotlight as one of Silicon Valley's highest-profile executives, and leave him bridging companies on opposite ends of the tech spectrum: Twitter caters to buzz-hungry internet scrollers. Salesforce's core software helps corporate sales teams manage their customers. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor said the roles complement each other: Tracking consumer technology for Twitter helps him innovate in enterprise software because many of those same trends affect Salesforce's corporate customers as well, he said. </p><p>   \"Day-to-day, though, they obviously exist in two really different worlds,\" he said. </p><p>   He faces challenges in both. Salesforce, which he joined in 2016 and where he previously was president and chief operating officer, has benefited from the pandemic-era cloud-computing boom, but its stock is down over the past month. Its latest quarterly outlook disappointed investors as the company's profit estimate for this quarter was less than what analysts had been expecting. </p><p>   His entrepreneurial pedigree, technical chops and product experience have endeared him to Salesforce co-founder and Chairman Marc Benioff, who called Mr. Taylor a \"phenomenal industry leader\" and a trusted friend when announcing him as his co-CEO. The two get along well, people who have watched them work together say, partly because they share a background in starting their own companies. </p><p>   Salesforce, though, has tried the co-CEO approach before, and it ended quickly. In 2018, Keith Block was promoted to co-CEO alongside Mr. Benioff after five years as president and chief operating officer. He left 18 months later, saying he was moving on to the \"next chapter.\" </p><p>   At Twitter, Mr. Taylor will be focused on helping the new CEO, Parag Agrawal -- who succeeded co-founder Jack Dorsey the same day Mr. Taylor was elevated to chairman -- try to realize ambitious growth goals. In February, Twitter announced targets to reach 315 million daily users and $7.5 billion annual revenue in the next two years. Twitter could end 2021 with around 218 million daily users and about $5 billion in annual revenue, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. </p><p>   The 15-year-old company has trailed the growth of rivals, especially Facebook, which has a user base about 10 times as large across its family of apps. Its shares have fallen more than 20% this year, while the Nasdaq has gained over 17%. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor said his main focus at Twitter is working with Mr. Agrawal and making sure he succeeds in the new role. Messrs. Dorsey and Agrawal praised Mr. Taylor. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor's two current employers have a history together: In late 2016, Mr. Benioff tried to engineer a Salesforce acquisition of Twitter. Mr. Taylor had joined Twitter's board shortly before Salesforce bought Quip, a document collaboration startup Mr. Taylor had co-founded, for about $582 million. With a foot in both camps, Mr. Taylor says he recused himself from the Salesforce discussions over Twitter. Mr. Benioff abandoned the pursuit after shareholder pushback. </p><p>   More recently, Mr. Benioff has been vocal in criticizing social-media companies and their leaders over misinformation and other harms. He has likened Facebook to cigarettes. Mr. Taylor said his own views on social media have changed since leaving Facebook. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor said he believes in how the platforms promote public discussion. \"It doesn't come without risks. I think it's a really important conversation for society to have: How do we get the benefits of this public conversation without some of the negative ramifications?\" </p><p>   Mr. Taylor has worked at several of the biggest tech companies at important moments. At Google in the early 2000s, he was product manager for Google Maps, one of the company's first successes beyond search. He and three colleagues left to form FriendFeed, a startup that aggregated updates, posts and other snippets from social-media platforms to create personalized feeds. Facebook acquired it in 2009, in part to hire Mr. Taylor and his co-founders, a person familiar with the deal said. FriendFeed had invented a \"like\" button, which Facebook added to its service. </p><p>   At Facebook, where he became chief technology officer, Mr. Taylor spearheaded an initiative that let external developers connect their tools and products to Facebook. With minimal oversight, the decision to provide data access to outsiders eventually led to data-sharing scandals after he left, including Cambridge Analytica. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor said he was motivated by concerns that users might want to export their data, and that Facebook had created a \"walled garden\" around its access to user information. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor left Facebook in 2012 to start Quip. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor's ability to multitask may determine his future. Mr. Dorsey, who split his time with his other company, Square, faced the ire of investors who had hoped he would focus on a single role. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor foresees no such issue for himself. \"I feel very comfortable with the time commitments and knew what I was getting into,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
