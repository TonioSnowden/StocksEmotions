  "title": "Elliott Buys Large Stake in Dropbox",
  "text": "<p>That suggests the hedge fund owns a stake of more than 10%, valued at well over $800 million. The two sides have been in talks since earlier this year.</p><p>Dropbox, a cloud-computing company with a market value of roughly $11 billion, went public in March 2018 and has been trading below its IPO price for most of that time.</p><p>Its modest valuation compared with those of other cloud companies such as Salesforce.com Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. has made it the subject of persistent takeover speculation.</p><p>That chatter intensified after Salesforce agreed to buy Slack Technologies Inc. last year for $27.7 billion. Other cloud companies have also gotten scooped up recently, including Cloudera Inc., which agreed to sell itself to a pair of private-equity firms this week. Activist Carl Icahn is a big Cloudera shareholder.</p><p>Dropbox's primary offering is cloud-based storage, which allows users to store documents, photos and videos online.</p><p>The company also has an offering that allows teams to edit centralized documents. It also owns DocSend, purchased in March, and HelloSign, which facilitates digital signatures.</p><p>Dropbox reported revenue of $1.9 billion for last year, an increase of 15%, and has more than 700 million registered users.</p><p>In May, the company said its first-quarter revenue rose 12% from the previous year. It also announced a $1 billion share-repurchase authorization in the first quarter.</p><p>Investors have questioned the company's growth prospects as services it provides become commoditized and it does less business with lucrative corporate customers than many of its peers.</p><p>Dropbox laid off around 11% of its workforce in January, not long after the company told employees most of them could work remotely indefinitely.</p><p>Mr. Houston, who founded Dropbox with Arash Ferdowsi in 2007, holds majority voting control. The company's next-largest shareholder is Vanguard Group, with a roughly 9.7% stake, according to FactSet.</p><p>Activists have typically steered clear of companies with powerful founders given that their work usually depends on being able to build a coalition of shareholder support.</p><p>But Elliott has broken that mold with past investments in Twitter Inc., SoftBank Group Corp. and various iterations of computer-and-storage giant Dell Technologies Inc., all of which featured founders with significant stakes and were relatively friendly investments.</p><p>Elliott, with more than $40 billion under management, is one of the busiest activist investors.</p><p>It also has a private-equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital, that sometimes bids on companies that are targets of the firm's activist campaigns.</p>",
