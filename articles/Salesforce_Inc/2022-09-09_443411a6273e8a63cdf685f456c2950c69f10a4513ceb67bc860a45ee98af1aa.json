  "title": "Kevin McCarthy's Fraught Path to Power; In his bid to be House Speaker, he has allied himself with the Trump-aligned wing of the Republican party",
  "text": "<p>That has so far allowed him to maintain broad support in a GOP increasingly populated by energetic and unruly pro-Trump lawmakers, according to Republican lawmakers and current and former congressional aides.</p><p>Many nonpartisan analysts and most polls suggest that Republicans will win control of the House, though some recent polls have shown Democrats' fortunes improving.</p><p>If Republicans take control, Mr. McCarthy's high-wire act will be tested. The members on his right flank have a list of demands and will be watching him closely to make sure he doesn't try to hold them back or compromise too much with Democrats. Similar pressures hampered his two predecessors as GOP leader, Paul Ryan and John Boehner.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy has started having conversations with lawmakers to head off future opposition. Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, who is running to be the top Republican on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, said holding such discussions is easy but wrangling votes is hard, because, \"It's difficult to get where 218 are on the same page\" on policy.</p><p>Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.), who is retiring, said Mr. McCarthy has appeased the far-right flank at the risk of losing centrist Republicans. He used to call Mr. McCarthy a friend, but they broke decisively over the GOP leader's approach to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.</p><p>\"He would come to us, 'Oh I've got to do this so I can control the crazies,' \" Mr. Kinzinger said. \"He'll be the worst speaker and he won't last because he's going to be led around by insurrectionists.\"</p><p>Cutting bipartisan deals is part of the speaker's job, particularly when the opposite party controls the White House and possibly the Senate. Unlike Messrs. Ryan and Boehner, both former committee chairmen, Mr. McCarthy has little record of that kind of work. Nor does he have much history as a legislator, with no signature issues or big policy achievements to his name. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has largely kept him out of big negotiations in the Democratic-controlled Congress.</p><p>The most common words that colleagues past and present used to describe Mr. McCarthy are congenial and jovial. They also call him \"not policy driven,\" and a \"shape shifter,\" a reference to how he has made friends with the broad swath of the caucus—and that he has never been known as an outspoken conservative or centrist.</p><p>\"Unlike say, a Newt, or maybe even me, where you want to be the lead policy maker, he looks at this more as a lead coaching role,\" said Mr. Ryan, referring to former Speaker Newt Gingrich.</p><p>Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.), a Trump ally who has improbably suggested the former president should be speaker, assessed Mr. McCarthy more sharply. \"Kevin is not bridled by too many policy views,\" he said. \"His organizing principle is ambition.\" </p><p>Mr. McCarthy at a North Carolina press conference to endorse Bo Hines, right, a Republican nominee for Congress. PHOTO: Alex Mousan for the Wall Street Journal</p><p>Mike Sommers, a former top aide to Mr. Boehner who now runs the American Petroleum Institute, made the case that Mr. McCarthy is well-suited to this moment. \"He's going to have to be leader of the opposition while at the same time figuring out how to govern,\" he said. \"In divided government, political skill is more important than policy skill because he will have to convince people that it's in their political interest to vote for something.\"</p><p>GOP lawmakers say that if Republicans don't win they could upend their entire leadership team. If Republicans do win, a slim majority powered by newly elected Trump allies could make it harder for Mr. McCarthy to wrangle enough votes on the House floor to secure—and keep—the job.</p><p>Political animal</p><p>Mr. McCarthy rose through the GOP ranks as a largely political animal, with an encyclopedic knowledge of districts around the country and a tireless appetite for raising money and campaigning. He is well-liked by most colleagues but not feared. Whether he is respected enough to keep his colleagues' backing will depend on the size of majority Republicans win in November.</p><p>\"I have a couple of different philosophies,\" Mr. McCarthy said in an interview. \"I'm continuing learning every day, I can never have too many friends in this world, and I never give up.\"</p><p>Mr. McCarthy, a 57-year-old native of Bakersfield, Calif., has been in leadership since 2009, his second term. His first speakership bid, to succeed Mr. Boehner, failed in 2015 after he made what was widely seen as a gaffe in a television interview about House Republicans' Benghazi investigation, when he said the probe was an effort to tank Hillary Clinton's poll numbers.</p><p>Mr. Ryan took the top job instead, holding it until the GOP lost the majority in 2018. Mr. McCarthy has been House minority leader since 2019 and is, at the moment, unopposed in his second bid for speaker.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy has created task forces to identify a platform for the new Congress, which he and House Republicans expect to announce in September as a \"Commitment to America.\" It is an echo of Mr. Gingrich's \"Contract with America,\" which Republicans used in 1994 to campaign to win the House majority.</p><p>In giving a preview of the commitment, Mr. McCarthy jumped from topic to topic. \"Energy independence, so that helps with inflation, and then what you want to be able to do is secure our streets, making them safe. We're not going to defund the police, we're going to fund the police,\" he said. Republicans also want to improve border security and allow parents to have more of a say in their children's education.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy has no relationship with President Biden and on Jan. 6, 2021, joined the majority of House Republicans to vote against certifying the election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania. He will lead a conference that wants to cut government spending, with members who want to use government-funding bills to repeal the Democrats' climate-and-tax bill that passed in August.</p><p>Such proposals would face steep obstacles, at least as long as a Democrat is in the White House. Most legislation the House passes with a simple majority could also hit a wall in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes.</p><p>And Mr. McCarthy, for the first time, would have to play a leading role in ensuring the federal government stays open and is able to pay its bills. Mr. Ryan ended his tenure by partially shutting down the government, unable to reach an agreement. Mr. Boehner had a tumultuous six-year tenure marked by repeated intraparty fiscal clashes.</p><p>Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the task forces that Mr. McCarthy has assembled \"aren't laying out a vision\" and he wants to see his party willing to shut down the government to remove funds for policies that Republicans don't support.</p><p>\"I've never once seen us lose political strength with a shutdown fight,\" he said, saying they should \"put forth a spending bill as the House of Representatives and make the Senate eat it.\"</p><p>Mr. McCarthy has been holding conversations with lawmakers on how to change the appropriations process to get Republicans on board with backing spending bills and how to tackle issues such as raising the debt ceiling. He said he has been studying the problems that befell past GOP majorities and taken the lesson that \"we didn't talk about the tough things ahead of time.\"</p><p>Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group that encompasses about 75% of the GOP conference, said its members \"all want to defund additional IRS agents and rein in spending. The real test of leadership will be getting those done without shutting down the government but that's where the leverage is.\"</p><p>Hard-line Republicans want Mr. McCarthy to reinstate the ability of any lawmaker to propose a vote on removing the speaker, a tool Democrats eliminated from House rules when they took power in 2019. The threat of such a vote helped contribute to Mr. Boehner's resignation in 2015.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy will face pressure to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of border policy and Attorney General Merrick Garland, who some Republicans say has abused his office. Mr. McCarthy said they were both worthy of investigation and said that should be done before he would back impeachment.</p><p>He will also need to decide what other investigations to pursue—and how far to push them—on topics ranging from the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the president's son, to the Justice Department's investigations of Mr. Trump and the Biden administration's coronavirus response. He would also like to launch a committee to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy has pledged to give committee positions to Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green (Ga.) and Paul Gosar (Ariz.), whom Democrats removed over comments pushing conspiracy theories. In retaliation, he plans to remove some Democrats including Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Eric Swalwell (Calif.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) from their current committee positions.</p><p>Leadership philosophy</p><p>Mr. McCarthy's leadership philosophy stems from what he learned in business school—he earned a bachelor's in marketing and a masters in business administration from California State University, Bakersfield—and from talking to corporate executives. He often mentions Tesla Inc. and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk as a personal friend and recently brought him to Jackson Hole to speak to GOP donors. He speaks with leaders of companies such as Salesforce Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., which shapes his policy focus.</p><p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called Mr. McCarthy a friend and said the two talk mostly about trees—Mr. Benioff's project to plant, conserve or restore one trillion trees, and Mr. McCarthy's efforts to preserve the giant Sequoias in Southern California.</p><p>Asked if the two talk of politics, he said: \"I don't think we've actually ever had a conversation in that zone.\"</p><p>He often quotes from books found in a business-school curriculum, such as Jim Collins's \"Good to Great\" and Simon Sinek's \"The Infinite Game,\" as well as Michael Lewis's \"Moneyball.\" He particularly cites the third chapter of Mr. Collins's book on putting the right people on a figurative bus, before figuring out where to drive it, as the element driving his leadership strategy.</p><p>One example he cites: putting Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a former foe who helped scuttle his previous speakership bid, in the top Republican slot on the Oversight Committee.</p><p>In 2018, when Mr. McCarthy was assembling committee leaders for the next year, Mr. Jordan didn't even apply for a ranking spot. Mr. McCarthy called Mr. Jordan, who was in the gym working out, and convinced him to apply, which surprised the steering committee full of Mr. McCarthy's allies.</p><p>\"He goes in and the steering committee revolts on me, so I have to have Jim leave,\" Mr. McCarthy recalls. \"And they're yelling at me, like 'you shouldn't do this.' I said…he's the very best at that job.' \"</p><p>Mr. Jordan, now an ally, said Mr. McCarthy also kept the conference together on the first House impeachment vote against Mr. Trump in 2019.</p><p>On some recent big-ticket bills that have been White House wins, he has seen GOP defections. Thirteen Republicans backed the infrastructure bill last year, causing the far-right members of the House GOP to vocally attack their colleagues. In July, Republican leadership told members to oppose a bill focused on boosting the semiconductor supply chain. Twenty-four Republicans voted for it.</p><p>Mr. Trump, whose endorsement pushed many Republicans through primaries, has kept some leverage over Mr. McCarthy by declining to endorse him for speaker.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy said he still speaks to Mr. Trump several times a week, but demurred when asked if he thought the former president should run again in 2024. He said he has no regrets on how he handled the riot at the Capitol last year, or afterward, even when the New York Times published audio of Mr. McCarthy saying he was \"seriously thinking\" about telling Trump to resign after Jan. 6.</p><p>\"Have you ever been friends with someone and have a difference of opinion?\" he said of Mr. Trump. He has a personal policy to not criticize the former president in public. A spokesman for Trump didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy's approach has drawn criticism from a notable source—his former boss, mentor and predecessor in his California district, ex-Rep. Bill Thomas. Mr. Thomas criticized Mr. McCarthy on local television station KGET-17 after the Jan. 6 riot, saying his former mentee was a \"hypocrite\" for putting political aspirations for party leadership before doing what's right for the country.</p><p>In Bakersfield, Mr. McCarthy lives in the first home he bought. His children attended the high school where he played football as a Driller, a reference to the vast oil fields that surround the area. \"He didn't have all of the talents,\" said Marshall Dillard, a former teammate, \"but he had a lot of grit.\"</p><p>To pay for college, Mr. McCarthy said, he used a winning lottery ticket to invest in the stock market that led to him starting a deli. He ran the deli for about two years, adjacent to his uncle's yogurt shop, before selling the business.</p><p>Passion for politics</p><p>His true passion was politics. He was rejected for a Washington internship for Mr. Thomas, but offered to work without pay in the district office. Cathy Abernathy, who was the chief of staff, agreed. He studied the details of the district and surrounding areas for campaigns he volunteered on, she recalled.</p><p>Later, as he flew back and forth from California to Washington as a member of Congress, he would study Congressional Quarterly's almanac. \"There's two things I looked at when I read the almanac,\" he said. \"I get to know people, their background, and I get to know their districts.\"</p><p>He worked for Mr. Thomas as district director until he ran for office in 2000, as a Kern Community College District trustee, and was elected to the State Assembly two years later. In his first year of arriving in Sacramento, he became the Republican leader in the chamber. In 2006, he won the seat of the retiring Mr. Thomas.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy soon held a number of lower-level positions within the House Republican leadership and became known as one of three Republican \"Young Guns,\" along with Mr. Ryan and then-Rep. Eric Cantor. (The trio wrote a 2010 book of the same name.)</p><p>Throughout his tenure, he has been a relentless fundraiser, an effort that has won him allies across the conference who owe him for the campaign help. In the past six months, he has brought in $124 million for his party, a personal record. \"It doesn't matter how much you do, you haven't done quite enough for Kevin McCarthy,\" Rep. Tom Cole (R., Okla.) said of lawmakers' response to Mr. McCarthy's fundraising pleas.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy is campaigning nonstop with the Republican nominees, visiting multiple states a day. He is also working to pull in money to help candidates—including figures such as J.R. Majewski, an Ohio Republican who insists the 2020 election was stolen and who attended the Jan. 6 rally at the Capitol that became a riot.</p><p>In Catawba Island, Ohio, in early August, Mr. McCarthy stood before roughly a dozen men at a dining room at the Stouffer Club who had paid $10,000 apiece to attend and pleaded with them to open their wallets for Mr. Majewski. A win by Mr. Majewski over longtime Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur would give Mr. McCarthy one more likely vote for speaker.</p><p>\"We just need money to get the message out,\" Mr. McCarthy said. \"I need you to bring more people to J.R.\"</p><p>Alex Leary contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com</p><p>Kevin McCarthy's Fraught Path to Power</p>",
