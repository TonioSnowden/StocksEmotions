  "title": "Facebook Parent Meta Announces Layoffs of 11,000 Staff; Layoffs are the first broad head-count reduction to occur in the company's history",
  "text": "<p>In a message to staff on Wednesday morning, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, would cut staff across all of its businesses, with its recruiting and business teams disproportionately affected. The company is also tightening its belt by reducing its office space, moving to desk-sharing for some workers and extending a hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>\"This is a sad moment, and there's no way around that,\" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, adding that he had been wrong in assuming that an increase in online activity during the pandemic would continue. \"I got this wrong and I take responsibility for that.\"</p><p>In a call Tuesday with hundreds of top managers, Mr. Zuckerberg said he had been overoptimistic about growth and was accountable for the company's missteps, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.</p><p>The layoffs are the first broad head-count reductions to occur in the company's 18-year history and a signal of the increasing competitive and regulatory challenges facing Meta. The tech industry more broadly is grappling with rising inflation and sluggish demand from advertisers.</p><p>Meta's stock has fallen more than 70% this year. The company has pointed to worsening macroeconomic trends, but investors have also been alarmed by its spending, particularly Mr. Zuckerberg's multibillion-dollar bet on the metaverse as the next digital frontier.</p><p>In his message to employees, Mr. Zuckerberg expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction. \"I believe we are deeply underestimated as a company today,\" he said. \"Our core business is among the most profitable ever built with huge potential ahead. And we're leading in developing the technology to define the future of social connection and the next computing platform.\"</p><p>Some investors have recently called for Meta to trim staff to cut costs. Meta's share price climbed more than 6% on Wednesday after the layoffs were announced, while the broader stock market fell more than 1%.</p><p>Meta's broader cost cutting will \"add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said in his memo. He said he would monitor business performance and other factors before deciding how quickly to resume hiring. He also said the company's spending on infrastructure related to artificial intelligence, which can require heaving computer-processing loads, could become more efficient.</p><p>Meta also faces threats to its core social-media business from other apps such as ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg referenced stiff competition, as well as Apple Inc.'s requirement that users opt-in to tracking of their devices, which has hurt Meta's ability to target ads.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg has been signaling for months that more fiscal discipline is coming and at times has adopted a tough tone, saying at a June company town hall that \"there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn't be here.\" On Wednesday, he took a softer approach, saying repeatedly that he takes personal responsibility for the company's missteps and expressing gratitude for the contributions of the departing employees.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg gave only limited insight in his message on Wednesday into which areas of the company would be reduced, apart from citing recruiting and business teams. People familiar with the matter said the cuts would in part affect staff with overlapping job responsibilities.</p><p>U.S. staffers who are losing their jobs will receive 16 weeks of severance, plus an additional two weeks for each year of employment at the company, and their stock options set to vest in mid-November will still vest. Meta will cover healthcare costs for those affected and their families for six months, he said.</p><p>Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September. Company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week, the Journal previously reported.</p><p>After hiring aggressively through the pandemic, the tech industry is facing its biggest retrenchment in years. Twitter, under new owner Elon Musk, is trying to restructure the company to match his vision, while facing widespread concern from advertisers about its new direction. Twitter cut roughly half of its staff last week.</p><p>Snap Inc. said in August it would cut roughly 20% of staff, or more than 1,000 employees, to prepare for what it said would be an expected period of low sales growth lasting into 2023.</p><p>Business software company Salesforce Inc. also started laying off employees this week. \"Our sales performance process drives accountability. Unfortunately, that can lead to some leaving the business, and we support them through their transition,\" the company said. The number of people let go was in the hundreds, the Journal previously reported.</p><p>Write to Sam Schechner at Sam.Schechner@wsj.com and Newley Purnell at newley.purnell@wsj.com</p><p>Facebook Parent Meta Announces Layoffs of 11,000 Staff</p>",
