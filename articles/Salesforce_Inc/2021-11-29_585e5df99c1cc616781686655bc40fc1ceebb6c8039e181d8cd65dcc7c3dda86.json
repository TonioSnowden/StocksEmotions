  "text": "<p>\"I've decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,\" Mr. Dorsey said in a statement.</p><p>Twitter's board of directors appointed Parag Agrawal as CEO and a member of the board, effective immediately. Mr. Agrawal was previously Twitter's chief technology officer.</p><p>Bret Taylor, Salesforce.com Inc. President and Chief Operating Officer, was named chairman of the board.</p><p>Twitter shares jumped on the news, rising as much as 11% before they were halted ahead of the announcement. After rising sharply early in the pandemic, Twitter shares have underperformed of late, dropping more than a third over the past six months.</p><p>With his long beard and nose ring, Mr. Dorsey, 45 years old, is one of the business world's most enigmatic figures, with a management style that involves delegating most major decisions to subordinates in part so he can pursue his personal passions.</p><p>Mr. Dorsey has left Twitter before. In 2008, the company fired him over concerns about his management and absenteeism.</p><p>Last year, his leadership of the company drew scrutiny from Elliott Management Corp., which is known as one of Wall Street's toughest activist investors.</p><p>Twitter and Elliott reached an agreement in which the company agreed to appoint two board members and commit to $2 billion in share buybacks, and Mr. Dorsey was allowed to stay on as CEO.</p><p>Mr. Dorsey will remain a member of Twitter's board until his term expires in 2022, the company said. CNBC previously reported his plans to step down as CEO.</p><p>Mr. Dorsey was one of Twitter's founders and has been closely associated with its development ever since. Yet in his departure note, he said he doesn't agree that a company being \"founder-led\"—often touted as a virtue in Silicon Valley—is always positive.</p><p>\"Ultimately I believe that is severely limiting and a single point of failure,\" he said. \"I believe it is critical a company can stand on its own, free of its founder's influence or direction.\"</p><p>Former employees described Twitter's new CEO, Mr. Agrawal, as a close friend of Mr. Dorsey. Like Mr. Dorsey, Mr. Agrawal started off as an engineer and worked his way into the ranks of management.</p><p>Mr. Dorsey said in his message that he will leave Twitter after his terms ends around May, to give Mr. Agrawal space as a leader.</p><p>Write to Georgia Wells at georgia.wells@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter's Jack Dorsey Steps Down as CEO</p>",
