  "title": "Wall Street places more bets on chip sector's soft landing in 2023; BofA analyst Arya joins Evercore's Muse on a few key top picks",
  "text": "<p>That follows Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse on Thursday, who listed Nvidia Corp. NVDA as his top pick going into 2023 on the belief that the mid-October low of 2,162 would result in a \"fundamental bottom\" and a soft landingfor the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX following a semiconductor shortage that flipped into a glut earlier in the year.</p><p>That said, BofA's Arya listed his top picks as Nvidia, and also had top picks that agreed with Muse with analog chip maker Analog Devices Inc. ADI, and chip and software company Broadcom Inc. AVGO, which received high marks recently for how it was handling itsproduct backlog and its glut-prevention sales practices.Muse has overweight ratings on all those stocks.</p><p>Also read: Salesforce 'in the penalty box,' while Workday sidestepping headwinds, analyst says of cloud software space</p><p>Arya differed with Muse in the rest of his picks, highlighting Applied Materials Inc. AMAT and KLA Corp. KLAC, as the \"semicaps key 'arms-dealers'\" as the fab industry tries to build more capacity outside of Taiwan.</p><p>\"Chip independence as important in next era as energy independence was in last century,\" the analyst said.</p><p>BofA Securities also upgraded electronic-design automation companies Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS (price target $205) and Synopsis Inc. SNPS (price target $410) to buy from neutral, as \"our prior concerns regarding impact from China restrictions on EDA demand have proven to be overly conservative.\"</p><p>The SOX index closed the week down closed down 3.1%, compared with a 2.1% decline on the S&amp;P 500 index SPX and a 2.7% fall on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP. For the year, the SOX is down 33%, the S&amp;P 500 is down 19%, and the Nasdaq is off 32%.</p><p>Wall Street places more bets on chip sector's soft landing in 2023</p>",
