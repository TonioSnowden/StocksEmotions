  "text": "<p>Hello from New York, where unionisation is in the air. Across the harbour from our Manhattan offices, Amazon employees on Staten Island <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e04e2dda-bb1e-4469-b6b3-fe959e44d422\">rejected efforts to form a union</a> earlier this week, dealing a blow to the nascent labour movement at the ecommerce giant. Amazon's management has deployed union-busting tactics to halt the drive. It is an issue that investors will consider at the company's annual meeting later this month.</p> <p>Unionisation played a role in BlackRock's <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/vote-bulletin-warrior-met-coal-apr-2022.pdf\">recent decision</a> to vote against board members at Warrior Met Coal, an Alabama-based coal producer, where about 1,000 unionised miners have been on strike (as our colleagues <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d8ee1b9-9a6d-422c-a53d-b166678eaec2\">have previously reported</a>). BlackRock said it has been leaning on the company to settle the labour fight. </p> <p>That's just one of many hot topics on the agenda this annual meetings season. Today, I delve into the question of how BlackRock and the other giant asset managers are voting at company meetings this year? Where are activists scoring wins and which issues have underwhelmed? Also, Kristen has a report on the Securities and Exchange Commission's climate proposal and its implications for an unexpected group of people: chief financial officers.

Such a showdown is not in the works this year. Still, companies are sweating as institutional investors turn up the heat on management.</p> <p>While the voting figures for the annual general meetings season will not be official until after June, shareholder activists can already point to some notable wins in recent weeks.</p> <p>Take, for example, workplace rights issues. A majority of shareholders at Apple and IBM supported a request that the companies eliminate certain non-disclosure agreements in their employee contracts in the US. The issue stems from <a href=\"https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2021-10-07-governor-newsom-signs-senator-leyva%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Csilenced-no-more-act%E2%80%9D\">a new California law</a> that bans such agreements. Shareholder activists <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61dead66-65cb-4e07-a12a-c079ff406aa1\">have been pushing</a> companies to stop using them across the whole country.</p> <p>Salesforce last week <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-extends-workplace-protections-in-ca-sb331-bill-to-all-u-s-employees/\">said</a> it would adopt the California non-disclosure ban nationwide rather than face a shareholder vote.</p> <p>A call for a civil rights audit at Apple also won investor support at the company's annual meeting in March.</p> <p>Not all issues have enjoyed such success. Shareholders at the biggest US banks showed little enthusiasm for proposals that asked the lenders to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/740b55f8-fa2e-4b66-9398-9f84aedbe8d8\">wind down lending to fossil fuel businesses</a>. More than three quarters of UBS shareholders <a href=\"https://www.ubs.com/global/en/media/display-page-ndp/en-20220406-agm.html\">supported a climate proposal</a>, but only 18 per cent of Credit Suisse shareholders endorsed a similar climate petition.</p> <p>One of the biggest themes this AGM season is likely to be the number of companies that readily settled with shareholder activists so that petitions would be withdrawn instead of going to a vote. As You Sow, a top shareholder proposal filer, has withdrawn 52 petitions so far this year, up from 49 in 2021 and 44 in 2020. Its wins this year include one at Coca-Cola, which <a href=\"https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2022/2/10/coca-cola-increase-sales-refillable-bottles\">agreed</a> to increase its sales of reusable bottles, and another at electricity company Duke Energy, which <a href=\"https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2022/2/10/duke-energys-net-zero-emissions\">promised</a> to tackle methane emissions linked to natural gas production.</p> <p>But many crunch votes are coming in the weeks ahead, especially at the big US technology companies. Amazon faces no fewer than <a href=\"https://www.iccr.org/shareholder-proposals-appearing-2022-amazon-proxy-ballot\">12 shareholder proposals</a> on issues ranging from facial recognition to working conditions in warehouses. Clearly, investor pressure is forcing companies to clean up their businesses, but how quickly the public will see results remains uncertain. (<em>Patrick Temple-West</em>)</p> <h1>SEC climate proposal has finance chiefs ‘in the hot seat'&#xa0;</h1> <p>When the SEC in March unveiled its long-awaited climate disclosure proposal, which would force companies to disclose new carbon-emissions metrics, some chief financial officers started to worry. </p> <p>Since the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals from the early 2000s, finance chiefs have been required to sign and attest to the accuracy of annual 10k regulatory filings. If the SEC's changes to climate disclosures go into effect, 10k filings would also need to include climate disclosures — making finance chiefs liable for the accuracy of carbon emission statements.</p> <p>“CFOs would be responsible for putting in place the processes, procedures and controls for gathering and reporting that information and ensuring its auditability. For most companies, this will be a big lift, in terms of time, complexity and cost,” said Michael Littenberg, a partner at law firm Ropes and Gray. “The rule as proposed will put CFOs on the hot seat and make them accountable for detailed climate risk disclosures.”</p> <p>After years leaving carbon disclosures to the corporate folks who handle sustainability reporting, finance chiefs must now get to grips with the field fast. And it will come at a cost. Large companies can expect to spend <a href=\"https://persefoni.com/newsroom/open-letter-to-business-leaders-on-the-cost-of-carbon-disclosure\">about $840,000 on compliance in the first year</a> under the new rules, according to Persefoni, a carbon consulting and tracking company. </p> <p>Moral Money has heard from sources at accounting firms and law firms that finance chiefs are already getting in touch about the SEC proposal. A team at a Big Four accounting group that typically helps finance chiefs on auditing matters is “knee-deep” in sustainable finance, sources have said. Finance chiefs are also discussing how hard they should push back against the SEC's proposal, and whether it's worth arm wrestling with the regulator that grades their homework.</p> <p>Finance chiefs already lost an effort to soften the SEC's climate rules. Earlier this year, companies pushed the SEC to create a separate filing process for carbon reporting, in which lawsuit liability would be less severe than it is for annual 10k reports. Further, the finance chief at chemical company Dow wrote to the SEC last year saying that climate-related disclosures should extend <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12-8883681-240446.pdf\">beyond the annual report deadlines.</a> For now, the SEC has said no to that idea.</p> <p>Even if the rules are finalised by the end of this year, finance chiefs will have at least a year to comply with new requirements. Moral Money will keep you updated on how they fare.&#xa0;(<em>Kristen Talman</em>)</p> <h1>Chart of the Week</h1> <p>Today's US Board Monitor <a href=\"https://app.insight.heidrick.com/BoardMonitorUS22\">report</a> from headhunter Heidrick &amp; Struggles hails “an infusion of fresh thinking” in 2021 as a record 45 per cent of board seats went to women, a record 43 per cent went to first-time directors and the number of new directors with sustainability experience more than doubled. But the diversity progress only goes so far: appointments of black directors slowed notably in the second half of the year, it found, while Hispanic, Asian and Asian-American directors remained heavily under-represented. </p> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Russia's war tests Europe's moral mettle as much as its economy, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/380482b2-6d25-4cc9-a3cc-7c8c832a46ef\">writes our colleague Martin Wolf</a>. “The challenge is to defend Europe's liberal civilisation. The opportunity is for historic redemption. Russia must not prevail. This is what matters most. There will indeed be pain. But it must be borne for a far greater cause.”</p></li>  <li><p>In <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/german-regulator-shelves-esg-rules-amid-russia-energy-fears\">the latest sign</a> that Russia's Ukraine invasion is frustrating ESG investing, BaFin, Germany's financial regulator has suspended an effort to classify investment funds as sustainable. “The environment isn't stable enough for permanent regulation,” BaFin president Mark Branson said on Tuesday, Bloomberg reports. </p></li> </ul><p>Source: Patrick Temple-West and Kristen Talman  2022 'Winners and losers at this year's AGMs ' FT.com 4 May.
