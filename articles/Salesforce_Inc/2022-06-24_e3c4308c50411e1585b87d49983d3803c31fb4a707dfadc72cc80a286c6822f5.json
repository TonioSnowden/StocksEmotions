  "title": "At Cannes Ad Festival, Marketers Brace for Economic Impact; Attendees celebrated the event's return to the French Riviera and packed parties featuring famous performers, while expressing concern about trends in the broader economy",
  "text": "<p>Companies including Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Spotify Technology SA built out seaside spaces, hosting client meetings and concerts by Dua Lipa and LCD Soundsystem, while ad-tech companies including Teads BV and Criteo SA entertained marketers and other industry players on yachts.</p><p>Marketing-industry executives were also clear-eyed about ominous trends in the broader economy, according to David Droga, chief executive and creative chairman of Accenture Song, a division of Accenture PLC focused on marketing, business innovation, commerce and other areas.</p><p>\"Every client is nervous about what's coming in the headwinds,\" Mr. Droga said. \"This isn't sort of 'celebrating with champagne on the sinking ship' type of thing. This is very much about, okay, we have to be smarter, we have to be in it together, and more deliberative and strategic about how we weather this.\"</p><p>Soyoung Kang, chief marketing officer at eos Products, said her company learned from what has happened in the last two years.</p><p>Eos is making moves more quickly than before, Ms. Kang said. \"We're operating at most six months into the future,\" she said. \"Many of the things that we're doing, we're operating more like two to three months into the future. And that's not changing.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Macquarie downgraded the stocks of advertising holding companies Interpublic Group of Cos., Omnicom Group Inc., Publicis Groupe SA and WPP PLC as recession fears have risen, despite what the firm said was a message from the companies that ad spending remains strong.</p><p>Philippe Krakowsky, chief executive of IPG, said during a panel conversation that there was no evidence of a marketer pullback in its numbers, but that clients do appear to be bracing for any impact.</p><p>\"They see the clouds and they're starting to put away the lawn furniture…or batten down the hatches,\" he said.</p><p>Dara Treseder, Peloton Interactive Inc.'s global head of marketing, communications and membership, said it is important to build marketing plans and budgets with multiple scenarios in mind.</p><p>\"I've been spending a lot of time focused on making sure I'm carving not only my media dollars but my non-media dollars to think about how to be able to respond to whatever the economy throws at me,\" Ms. Treseder said at an event hosted by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The so-called creator economy continues to boom, meanwhile, as demonstrated by the bevy of social-media stars at parties in Cannes for companies such as TikTok.</p><p>\"The creator economy may soon eclipse traditional creative in both marketer interest and marketplace impact,\" said Lou Paskalis, president and chief operating officer of MMA Global Inc., a marketing trade group.</p><p>Other companies came to Cannes vying to show how they can help marketers improve digital customer experience.</p><p>\"Customer experience design is becoming mainstream at Cannes as evidenced by the presence of the major end-to-end experience enablers like Salesforce and Oracle,\" Mr. Paskalis said. \"Cannes is morphing into a tech and data event, where the tech and data fuels creative.\"</p><p>Sustainability was another common thread, with ample programming on the topic and Greenpeace staging several protests at the conference over working with clients in the fossil-fuels space.</p><p>Marketers also grappled with how much, or whether, to invest in nonfungible tokens. The festival hosted a session with Paris Hilton, who last year founded 11:11 Media to expand her brands, and Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of ad agency VaynerMedia, about NFTs and what they mean for brands.</p><p>Though the NFT space has seen a downturn, both argued for its future.</p><p>\"It's such a new thing and it's obviously a volatile market but…I've been invested in the crypto world since 2015 and it's something that I believe in,\" Ms. Hilton said in an interview.</p><p>Ms. Hilton appeared at numerous events throughout the week, taking meetings \"from morning until night,\" she said, to discuss potential collaborations and opportunities in the new vision of the internet dubbed Web3.</p><p>\"With the economy, with how it is right now, obviously people are afraid of the unknown,\" Ms. Hilton said. \"It's a time to come in and buy the dip. Everything is going digital, everything.\"</p><p>Patience Haggin contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.com</p><p>At Cannes Ad Festival, Marketers Brace for Economic Impact</p>",
