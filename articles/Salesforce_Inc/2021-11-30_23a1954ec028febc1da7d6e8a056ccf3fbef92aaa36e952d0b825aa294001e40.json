  "title": "Twitter's Dorsey Bows Out As CEO --- Top technology officer Parag Agrawal named to succeed co-founder; investor sought change",
  "text": "<p>The company said in a securities filing in November that it had updated its CEO succession plan. The board, which included an Elliott representative, and Mr. Dorsey discussed plans at the time for him to step down relatively soon, the people said. He decided to resign now after Twitter launched a number of new products in recent months, the people said.</p><p>Twitter's board named Parag Agrawal CEO and a member of the board, effective immediately. Mr. Agrawal was previously Twitter's chief technology officer. Bret Taylor, Salesforce.com Inc. president and chief operating officer, was named chairman.</p><p>\"I've decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,\" Mr. Dorsey said.</p><p>Elliott said Monday that it believes Messrs. Agrawal and Taylor are the right leaders for the company.</p><p>Mr. Dorsey's move doesn't affect his position at Square, which he also co-founded. With a market capitalization of almost $100 billion, Square is more than twice as valuable as Twitter, which is valued at about $37 billion.</p><p>With his long beard and nose ring, 45-year-old Mr. Dorsey is one of the business world's most enigmatic figures. His management style involves delegating most major decisions to subordinates, in part to allow other executives to step up. It also allows him to pursue his personal passions.</p><p>In 2019, he said he planned to work much of the following year from Africa, though he later abandoned those plans amid the pandemic. Lately, he has been a vocal proponent of cryptocurrency and an increasingly active philanthropist.</p><p>Many employees have praised Mr. Dorsey as a stabilizing force since he returned to the CEO role in 2015, years after Twitter fired him in 2008 over concerns about his management and absenteeism.</p><p>Known for its short-form messaging service, Twitter is a popular venue for political and pop-culture discourse, but it has struggled to find sources of growth. Twitter use, measured by monetizable daily active usage, was up 13% year-over-year to 211 million in the third quarter, topping the 11% increase in the second quarter. That user base remains a fraction of the size of the other major social-media platforms, including Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube and ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok.</p><p>Twitter is experimenting with new products. In the third quarter, it launched a pilot of a shopping feature called Shop Module that allows businesses to showcase their products at the top of their profiles and users to purchase items without having to leave Twitter. The company also has launched a subscription service and Twitter Spaces, which lets users have live audio conversations.</p><p>Not all such efforts have succeeded. In July, the company said it would scrap its Fleets feature, which allowed users to post tweets, pictures and videos that would disappear after 24 hours.</p><p>In February, Twitter revealed lofty targets to reach at least $7.5 billion in annual revenue in 2023 and a daily user base of at least 315 million by the end of that year. The company is expected to end 2021 with $5.1 billion in annual revenue and about 216 million in daily active users, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.</p><p>Twitter shares initially jumped on a report of Mr. Dorsey's departure, rising as much as 11% before they were halted ahead of the announcement. They finished the day down 2.7%. Twitter shares have declined more than a third over the past six months.</p><p>Since Mr. Dorsey returned as CEO in 2015, Twitter shares have gained 62.6%, versus 230.1% for the Nasdaq Composite.</p><p>The battle with Elliott highlighted many of Twitter's business struggles. Twitter and Elliott reached a deal last year in which the social-media company agreed to appoint two board members and commit to $2 billion in share buybacks, with Mr. Dorsey remaining CEO while Twitter developed a succession plan.</p><p>Despite the concessions and new product releases, Elliott never became fully comfortable with Mr. Dorsey's unwillingness to focus on Twitter full time, according to people familiar with the matter. Twitter said Mr. Dorsey would remain a member of its board until his term expires in 2022.</p><p>Mr. Dorsey led Twitter through a tumultuous period that saw intense public debate over the role of social media in society, particularly around how such platforms should regulate speech.</p><p>Mr. Agrawal inherits those issues. Relatively unknown outside of Twitter, where he has worked as an engineer for more than a decade, he will need to address some lawmakers' calls to better police what the company deems hate speech and misinformation along with others' allegations that Twitter improperly censors users.</p><p>For years, Twitter's highest-profile user was former President Donald Trump, until Twitter permanently suspended his account early this year, citing the risk of incitement of violence following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters. The move renewed longstanding complaints from conservatives who said the company is biased against them, allegations that Mr. Dorsey has denied repeatedly before Congress.</p><p>The episode also highlighted Mr. Dorsey's hands-off management approach: The CEO was working in French Polynesia at the time and allowed his lieutenants to make the call.</p>",
