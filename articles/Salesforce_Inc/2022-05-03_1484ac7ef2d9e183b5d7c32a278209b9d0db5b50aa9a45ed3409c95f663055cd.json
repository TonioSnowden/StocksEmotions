  "title": "U.S. News:  Judge Rejects RNC Suit Against Jan. 6 Panel  ----  By Alexa Corse and Lindsay Wise",
  "text": "<p>   A federal judge ruled that the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack can obtain data from one of the Republican National Committee's vendors about fundraising and political efforts. </p><p>   U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly rejected a lawsuit filed by the RNC in March seeking to stop one of its vendors, Salesforce.com Inc., from turning over records to the Jan. 6 committee, in a 53-page opinion issued late Sunday. </p><p>   The decision represented a victory for the Jan. 6 committee that could bolster the panel in other lawsuits attempting to resist its subpoenas. </p><p>   The panel, made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, said it is still trying to gather information about the causes and circumstances surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump. </p><p>   On Monday, the select committee said it has asked three more House members to cooperate voluntarily with the probe: Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Ronny Jackson of Texas, all close supporters of Mr. Trump. </p><p>   Judge Kelly, an appointee of Mr. Trump, issued an injunction temporarily blocking the data from being turned over to the Jan. 6 committee until May 5 to give the RNC a chance to appeal his ruling. </p><p>   The Jan. 6 panel had subpoenaed records related to the RNC's fundraising and digital efforts from Salesforce, a commercial marketing platform that the party used to manage communications with donors. </p><p>   Matt Raymer, chief counsel for the RNC, said that the organization would appeal and that the subpoena had been narrowed after negotiations between the select committee and Salesforce. \"Nancy Pelosi's attempted seizure of her political opponents' campaign strategy cannot be allowed to stand, and we appreciate Judge Kelly continuing to temporarily block the subpoena,\" Mr. Raymer said. </p><p>   Salesforce didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   The House committee said it issued the subpoena to help investigators understand the impact of what the panel called false and inflammatory statements about the 2020 election results. The panel said it wasn't seeking records on individual voters or donors. </p><p>   The RNC's lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleged the subpoena was overly broad and would give the Jan. 6 committee access to sensitive information about donors and the party's digital strategies. </p><p>   Judge Kelly rejected several arguments made by the RNC, including that the subpoena violated its First Amendment rights by compelling the disclosure of confidential internal strategies, and that the panel's demands were unduly burdensome. He also rejected the RNC's claims that the Jan. 6 committee itself was invalidly formed and that the panel's subpoena lacked a valid legislative purpose. </p><p>   In its letter Monday, select committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D., Miss.) and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) said that Messrs. Biggs, Brooks and Jackson have information relevant to the facts, circumstances and causes of the Capitol attack. </p><p>   In the committee's letter to Mr. Biggs, Mr. Thompson and Ms. Cheney write that they want to ask him about communications between him and then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about efforts to persuade state legislators and officials that the 2020 election was stolen and seek their help in overturning the election in favor of Mr. Trump. </p><p>   The committee's letter also says that \"recent information from former White House personnel\" has revealed an effort by some House Republicans after Jan. 6 \"to seek a presidential pardon for activities taken in connection with President Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\" </p><p>   The letter says Mr. Biggs's name was identified as a potential participant in the pardon effort. \"We would like to understand all the details of the request for a pardon, more specific reasons why a pardon was sought, and the scope of the proposed pardon,\" it says. </p><p>   Mr. Jackson said he wouldnt cooperate with the committee, saying its agenda was \"malicious and not substantive.\" Mr. Biggs called the probe a sham and said he wouldn't cooperate. Mr. Brooks also declined to cooperate, calling it a \"Witch Hunt Committee.\" </p><p></p>",
