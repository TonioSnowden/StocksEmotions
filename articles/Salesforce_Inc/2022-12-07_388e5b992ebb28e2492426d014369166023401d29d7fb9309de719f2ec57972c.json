  "text": "<p>While the two had worked well together, cracks started forming in recent months that created friction between the men, the people familiar with the matter said. Ahead of Salesforce's announcement that Taylor would exit, there was some discussion about trying to work things out and arranging for Taylor to stay for another year or so, but that didn't pan out, some of the people said.</p><p>The growing strains ultimately resulted in Salesforce's announcement last week that Taylor would vacate the co-CEO role on Jan. 31, with Benioff becoming the sole leader again and continuing to serve as the company's chairman. Taylor, 42 years old, has shared the top role with Benioff for about a year. His planned departure marks the second time in less than three years that Benioff has parted ways with someone installed as his co-CEO.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com.</p><p>Elon Musk's release of documents triggers Twitter lawyer Jim Baker's exit.</p><p>Whitey Bulger was killed after inmates were tipped off on his prison transfer, watchdog says.</p><p>Growing strains between Salesforce co-CEOs Benioff and Taylor in months ahead of departure announcement</p>",
