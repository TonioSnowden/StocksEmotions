  "title": "Salesforce Provides Limited Cloud Cover --- Strong results from the subscription-based enterprise software maker won't clear up questions about industry demand",
  "text": "<p>Fiscal first-quarter results from Salesforce seemed to bring a ray of light to the beaten-down cloud-software sector. Revenue jumped 24% year over year to $7.4 billion as the largest pure-play seller of subscription-based enterprise software claimed to see no slippage in demand due to the macroeconomic challenges affecting many industries. That gave cloud stocks a boost in early-morning trading on Wednesday.</p><p>But Salesforce's results were hardly a blowout. In fact, revenue for the quarter ended April 30 was 0.4% above Wall Street's projections -- the narrowest such beat in at least five years, according to FactSet. What is more, Salesforce trimmed its full-year revenue forecast by about 1% and issued a revenue projection for the current quarter that was below analysts' forecasts. The company chalked this up to currency headwinds, though Mark Moerdler of Bernstein noted that \"other than during the early days of Covid-19 this is the first time Salesforce hasn't increased FY guidance in constant currency in recent memory.\"</p><p>Hence, cloud stocks slipped into the red Wednesday. Salesforce results followed a handful of others that together presented an uneven picture for the current state of the industry. Last week saw disappointing reports from Workday and Snowflake but strong results from Zscaler. The latter, which provides cloud-based cybersecurity software, saw revenue jump 63% for the April quarter and provided a growth outlook for the July period that was solidly ahead of Wall Street's forecasts.</p><p>Workday reported billings for the quarter that were below Wall Street's targets, as the maker of human-relations and financial-management software noted several major deals expected to close in the recently ended quarter got pushed to later in the fiscal year.</p><p>Snowflake, meanwhile, is posting booming growth numbers, with revenue up 85% year over year in the latest quarter. But it was the smallest percentage beat on record for the maker of cloud-based business analytics software. The company told analysts that some of its customers, facing \"a more challenging operating environment,\" dialed back their use of its service during the quarter -- affecting revenue growth given Snowflake's usage-based business model.</p><p>In the current environment, Salesforce benefits from its scale and the breadth of its offerings. The company, which is on track to surpass $30 billion in annual revenue this year, expanded well from the customer-relationship-management software with which it first made its name.</p><p>The recent addition of Slack gives Salesforce an even deeper foothold with companies looking to enable remote workforces.</p><p>And relative to many of its younger cloud peers, Salesforce is mature enough to deliver on both the top and bottom line.</p><p>Adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion for the most recent quarter beat Wall Street's targets, and Salesforce even nudged up its operating margin target for the full fiscal year ending next January.</p><p>The acquisitive company is projecting a sense of newfound restraint. Co-Chief Executive Marc Benioff said on Tuesday's conference call that large-scale M&amp;A deals are \"just not a part of our playbook right now,\" despite the selloff in cloud stocks that he equated to a \"right-sizing on a number of valuations.\" Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank noted Salesforce's unwavering commitment to growing margins and free cash flow is \"essential for the stock to continue working from here.\"</p><p>Salesforce shares closed up nearly 10% Wednesday, in line for their best day in nearly two years. Message received.</p>",
