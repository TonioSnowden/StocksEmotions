  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Salesforce  Isn't  Slacking  On Margin  ---  Cloud-software giant  signals spending shift  ----  By Dan Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A message of austerity from Salesforce is welcome, though the cloud-software giant picked an ironic time to share it. </p><p>\n  Salesforce got back into the business of packing visitors into its San Francisco hometown this week for its Dreamforce conference. Salesforce says more than 40,000 attendees showed up. </p><p>\n  Even for a company that now drops more than $13 billion a year on sales and marketing expenses, it isn't a cheap undertaking. A shortage of hotel rooms in 2015 forced Salesforce to charter a 965-foot cruise ship and park it at a nearby dock to accommodate visitors. </p><p>\n  The company used this year's event to unveil new products and services such as Genie, a real-time data management platform for businesses, and a marketplace for businesses to exchange carbon credits. It used an analyst meeting late Wednesday to unveil a plan to reach adjusted operating margins of 25% by the end of its fiscal year that closes in January 2026. </p><p>\n  That is about 5 percentage points above what Salesforce expects for the current fiscal year and would represent a new high. Salesforce shares rose 1.7% Thursday -- one of the few tech gainers. </p><p>\n  Embedded in that goal is a plan to reduce sales and marketing costs to less than 35% of revenue compared with about 45% now. Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver sought to reassure investors worried about dilution from share issuance, saying the company would \"prioritize the use of our balance sheet\" for major acquisitions. </p><p>\n  Salesforce's three largest deals to date -- with transaction values totaling nearly $47 billion -- each involved significant stock components. </p><p>\n  Ambitious targets are nothing new for Salesforce, but those have typically involved the company's obsession with keeping annual revenue growth above 20%. That is a taller task now, both due to size (trailing 12-month revenue is now just under $30 billion) and a slowing global economy possibly entering a recession. </p><p>\n  Cloud-software investors are also rebelling against aggressive M&amp;A deals. </p><p>\n  Zendesk and Zoom Video recently had acquisition attempts voted down by their respective shareholders, and Adobe has shed nearly one-quarter of its market value since announcing a $20 billion deal for Figma last week. </p><p>\n  Salesforce has been in a bit of a penalty box as well, with its stock lagging behind the Nasdaq and major software peers since its announcement of the Slack acquisition for nearly $28 billion in December 2020. </p><p>\n  Slack had reported straight operating losses since its inception, so investors worried about the impact to the bottom line. </p><p>\n  But Slack also figures heavily into the company's growth plans; Salesforce says its revenue target for the current fiscal year includes $1.5 billion in contribution from Slack, whose annual revenue was running just below the $1 billion level when the deal closed in mid-2021. </p><p>\n  Salesforce may not be done buying growth, but showing the ability to do so profitably would go a long way toward lifting this particular cloud. </p><p></p>",
