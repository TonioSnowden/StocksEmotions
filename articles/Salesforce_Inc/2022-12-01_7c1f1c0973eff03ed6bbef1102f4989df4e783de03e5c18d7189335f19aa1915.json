  "title": "Salesforce Isn't on Cloud Nine; Loss of another co-CEO comes as the software giant's growth engine slows",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Taylor lasted one year on the job—six months less than the last co-CEO the company tried back in 2018. In fairness, that one year also included a taxing stint as board chairman of Twitter, where Mr. Taylor was tasked with handling the sale of the company to Elon Musk. He eventually had to take him to court to close the deal.</p><p>Regardless of who is in the corner office, Salesforce is facing some of its most significant challenges in years. The slumping global economy is making the big corporate customers Salesforce counts on extra cautious about their spending. That, plus the stronger dollar, is leading to some of the weakest growth rates Salesforce has ever seen.</p><p>Revenue for the fiscal third-quarter ended October grew 14% year over year and the midpoint of the company's projection for the current quarter represents growth of only 9% year over year—a record low and a humbling number for a company that has long prided itself on 20%-plus growth rates.</p><p>It doesn't look temporary. Billings, a measure of new business transacted during the quarter, grew only 5% year over year—a record low. Salesforce also broke with established practice in its past third-quarter reports by declining to give a forecast for the next fiscal year.</p><p>In the company's conference call, Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver cited the \"very unpredictable macro environment\" as the main reason for the move, though peers like Workday and Snowflake managed to issue projections for the same period in their own quarterly reports this week. The typically ebullient Mr. Benioff added: \"We're not assuming that this economy gets better anytime soon.\" Salesforce shares fell nearly 11% Thursday.</p><p>Slower growth prospects means Salesforce will be truly testing the appeal of its newfound focus on the bottom line. At least the trends here are good: Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.8 billion in the most recent quarter beat Wall Street's projections by 8%, while leading to a record-high margin of 22.7%. Ms. Weaver affirmed the company's target of bringing this number to 25% on an annual basis by the 2026 fiscal year.</p><p>\"The commitment to profitability appears nonnegotiable and is core to our thesis at this point,\" wrote Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Still, another shuffle at the top creates more questions at an especially bad time. There didn't appear to be much drama involved; Mr. Taylor participated in Wednesday's call, on which Mr. Benioff proclaimed \"I love him very deeply\" and promised to keep trying to change his mind about leaving.</p><p>But many saw Mr. Taylor's appointment to the job as part of an eventual succession plan for Mr. Benioff, who has been running the company he co-founded since 2001. And, while the 58-year-old Mr. Benioff doesn't exactly have a foot in the grave, leadership succession has become top of mind for investors lately, with firms like Starbucks and Disney recently seeing the return of iconic CEOs to help restore some luster to the companies they stepped away from.</p><p>Mr. Taylor, having made his mark as a successful startup CEO, might not be terribly interested in steering an established and now-slow-growth software giant. That sends Mr. Benioff back to the drawing board—again.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Salesforce Isn't on Cloud Nine</p>",
