  "title": "Elliott Buys Large  Stake in Dropbox  ----  By Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   Elliott Management Corp. has taken a sizable stake in software company Dropbox Inc., the latest target for the activist hedge fund, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Elliott has told Dropbox it is the company's largest shareholder after Chief Executive Officer Drew Houston, the people said. </p><p>   That suggests the hedge fund owns a stake of more than 10%, valued at well over $800 million. The two sides have been in talks since earlier this year. </p><p>   Dropbox, a cloud-computing company with a market value of roughly $11 billion, went public in March 2018 and has been trading below its IPO price for most of that time. </p><p>   Its modest valuation compared with those of other cloud companies such as Salesforce.com Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. has made it the subject of persistent takeover speculation. </p><p>   That chatter intensified after Salesforce agreed to buy Slack Technologies Inc. last year for $27.7 billion. Other cloud companies have also gotten scooped up recently, including Cloudera Inc., which agreed to sell itself to a pair of private-equity firms this week. Activist Carl Icahn is a big Cloudera shareholder. </p><p>   Dropbox's primary offering is cloud-based storage, which allows users to store documents, photos and videos online. </p><p>   The company also has an offering that allows teams to edit centralized documents. It also owns DocSend, purchased in March, and HelloSign, which facilitates digital signatures. </p><p>   Dropbox reported revenue of $1.9 billion for last year, an increase of 15%, and has more than 700 million registered users. </p><p>   In May, the company said its first-quarter revenue rose 12% from the previous year. It also announced a $1 billion share-repurchase authorization in the first quarter. </p><p>   Investors have questioned the company's growth prospects as services it provides become commoditized and it does less business with lucrative corporate customers than many of its peers. </p><p>   Dropbox laid off around 11% of its workforce in January, not long after the company told employees most of them could work remotely indefinitely. </p><p>   Mr. Houston, who founded Dropbox with Arash Ferdowsi in 2007, holds majority voting control. The company's next-largest shareholder is Vanguard Group, with a roughly 9.7% stake, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Activists have typically steered clear of companies with powerful founders  given that their work usually depends on being able to build a coalition of shareholder support. </p><p>   But Elliott has broken that mold with past investments in Twitter Inc., SoftBank Group Corp. and various iterations of computer-and-storage giant Dell Technologies Inc., all of which featured founders with significant stakes and were relatively friendly investments. </p><p>   Elliott, with more than $40 billion under management, is one of the busiest activist investors. </p><p>   It also has a private-equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital, that sometimes bids on companies that are targets of the firm's activist campaigns. </p><p></p>",
