  "title": "San Francisco Is Slow to Reopen",
  "text": "<p>The decreased foot traffic has meant many of the stores and restaurants in San Francisco's business district remain closed. \"It's a ghost town,\" said Steve Sarver, owner of the Ladle &amp; Leaf group of restaurants, which kept only one of its eight downtown locations open.</p><p>A major reason for the delayed return to normal is that tech companies are proving to be among the slowest to repopulate office space, as well as the most flexible in allowing employees to keep working from home after the health crisis ends, say companies, brokers and landlords in the Bay Area.</p><p>Companies in other businesses in other regions of the U.S. are adopting hybrid strategies that include office and remote work. But workplace boundaries are being pushed the furthest by tech companies in the San Francisco region, such as Salesforce.com Inc., Dropbox Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, as they try to appeal to their younger highly skilled workers who like working remotely.</p><p>\"What we're facing are habit changes more than health concerns,\" said Colin Yasukochi, senior technology researcher at CBRE Group Inc., a commercial-real-estate services firm.</p><p>In Texas cities such as Houston and Dallas, where employers are requiring workers to return to the office, office buildings are on average back to 50% of their pre-pandemic usage, according to Kastle.</p><p>Few San Francisco employers are taking such steps. Meanwhile, the city government has been one of the slowest to relax mask restrictions and the Bay Area Rapid Transit system isn't planning a return to pre-pandemic service for months.</p><p>Frustration is growing among small-business owners who had hoped that the success of the U.S. vaccination campaign would speed the return of their customers. About half of San Francisco's small businesses remain closed, according to data-tracking and software firm Womply.</p><p>\"We're really not seeing that much is going to take hold until the latter half of this year or more likely January,\" said Laurie Thomas, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association.</p><p>San Francisco's future also is clouded by the long-term workplace strategies some big tenants are adopting. File-hosting service Dropbox, for example, has made working from home the primary working mode for all its employees, including the roughly 1,000 who worked in the company's San Francisco headquarters, which will be kept open for collaboration and training.</p><p>Other big Bay Area tech firms have backtracked after employees pushed back on return-to-office plans that they said included too much office time. Uber Technologies Inc. said last week that it would let staffers work from anywhere as much as half the time.</p><p>That is a change from the spring when Uber said employees would return to their pre-Covid-19 workspaces at least three days a week starting in September. \"We know certain jobs can be successful without being in an office, and this option can work well for some people,\" said Nikki Krishnamurthy, Uber's chief people officer, in a posting last week on the company's website.</p>",
