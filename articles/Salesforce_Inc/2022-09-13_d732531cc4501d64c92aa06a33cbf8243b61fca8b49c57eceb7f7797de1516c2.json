  "title": "Olympia Sports to Liquidate in Bankruptcy; Maine-based sporting goods retailer blamed business failure on pandemic fallout and an unsuccessful foray into e-commerce",
  "text": "<p>The company, founded in 1975, largely blamed fallout from the pandemic including shutdowns that made aging inventory more difficult to sell. It also said a foray into online sales starting around 2018 was unprofitable.</p><p>\"Due to the cost of shipping, the extent of competition in the e-commerce space and other factors, the e-commerce space turned out to be an unprofitable venture,\" Olympia Chief Executive Mark Coffey said in a sworn declaration. He said Olympia had technological problems with its Salesforce Inc. e-commerce platform and ceased online operations in April.</p><p>Salesforce, which is owed roughly $2.1 million in the bankruptcy, didn't immediately comment.</p><p>Olympia said it is also involved in at least seven legal actions, including one filed by Nike USA Inc. In July, Nike sued Olympia Sports in the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., saying it was owed more than $670,000 for footwear and apparel that it supplied, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Olympia said it recorded $28 million in revenue through July 31 of this year, compared with $74 million in revenue in all of last year.</p><p>Its largest creditor, United Parcel Service Inc., owed roughly $3.2 million, couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>States Olympia operates in include New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York. It has 324 employees, most of whom work in stores.</p><p>At its peak, Olympia had 230 locations. As recently as April, it had 63 stores.</p><p>Olympia and a dozen related entities are represented in the bankruptcy by law firm Morris James LLP and Shulman Bastian Friedman &amp; Bui LLP. SB360 Capital Partners LLC is being hired to run store-closing sales.</p><p>The cases have been consolidated under number 22-10853 and assigned to Judge Mary Walrath.</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p>",
