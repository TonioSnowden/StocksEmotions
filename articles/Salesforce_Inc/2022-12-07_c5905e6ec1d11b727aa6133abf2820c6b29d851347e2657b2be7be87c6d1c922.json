  "text": "<p>The latest salvo came from Snap Inc. SNAP last month, which expects employees to spend at least 80% of their time in the office, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel says the policy, which starts in February, will help the company achieve \"full potential\" and allow workers to reach \"our collective success.\"</p><p>With companies contracting their workforces and pinching pennies amid a wobbly economy, companies increasingly see onsite workers as essential to maximizing revenue. Indeed, market researcher IDC predicts large companies that \"deploy reactive and tactical hybrid work models\" will suffer a revenue loss of 20% in 2024 because of job attrition and underperforming teams.</p><p>Salesforce Inc. CRM CEO Marc Benioff has pushed back on the notion, saying in June that back-to-office mandates would \"never work.\" And a recent report from Dr. Grace Lordan of the London School of Economics claims, \"Firms that demand their employees are in the office for no reason will lose out on diverse talent pools.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, the pressure is on among some employers, including Twitter Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, to come back.</p><p>Nearly 500 employees at C3.ai Inc. AI fill three floors of an office building tower in Redwood City, Calif. It takes a trip around the expansive parking lot to find a space.</p><p>\"Everyone is here. Have been for a year,\" company CEO Tom Siebel told MarketWatch. \"Look at that packed parking lot. People need to interact in person to effectively collaborate.\"</p><p>Other tech executives anticipate a return to work after years of COVID-mandated isolation. \"You will see more momentum\" of employers pressuring workers to return to the office at least four days a week, Box Inc. BOX CEO Aaron Levie told MarketWatch. \"It is super important to have people work side by side and in person.\"</p><p>Adds Paul Friesen, chief marketing officer of Rapid, which advocates three days in the office a week: \"We value having employees come together, collaborate and drive productive outcomes in person while also understanding the new world work environment and the need to balance in-office with work from home and remote experiences.\"</p><p>Snap and other tech companies have a new edict for employees: Return to the office</p>",
