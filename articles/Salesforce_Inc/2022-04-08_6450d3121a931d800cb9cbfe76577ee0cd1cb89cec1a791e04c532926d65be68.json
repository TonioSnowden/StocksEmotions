  "title": "Business News:  Climate-Reporting Rules Face Scrutiny  ---  Review spurred by  worry that standards  let companies seem  greener than they are  ----  By Phred Dvorak",
  "text": "<p>\n  As more companies report greenhouse-gas emissions, the standards they follow are coming under sharper scrutiny amid criticism that they make the companies seem greener than they are. </p><p>\n  The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a coalition of environmental groups and businesses, developed what have become the de facto standards for companies to disclose the carbon footprints of their operations, energy use and products, categorizing them as scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. </p><p>\n  Companies and investors increasingly rely upon the standards to guide trillions of dollars in environmentally minded investments, while regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission are drawing on them for proposed disclosure requirements aimed at combating climate change. </p><p>\n  Now the group is commissioning a review of the standards, spurred in part by concerns that the current guidelines could result in misleading corporate emissions reports or outright greenwashing, the term for making something seem more environmentally friendly than it is, say researchers and others close to the effort. </p><p>\n  One big concern: guidelines that let hundreds of companies from Apple Inc. to AstraZeneca PLC say they are procuring carbon-free energy, even though that doesn't always reflect their actual energy consumption. </p><p>\n  \"Ten years ago, there wasn't actually a huge amount of scrutiny on the numbers the companies were disclosing,\" said Matthew Brander, a senior lecturer in carbon accounting at the University of Edinburgh Business School who has been a critic of some of the standards. \"Increasingly investors are using GHG disclosures to make capital-allocation decisions. And I think that is just turning up the spotlight a little bit on the robustness of the numbers that are being disclosed.\" </p><p>\n  The review of GHG Protocol's standards highlights the high stakes surrounding corporate climate targets and emissions disclosures. Last month, the SEC proposed requiring listed companies to disclose greenhouse-gas emissions along with climate-related risks; European and Japanese regulators are pushing various disclosure plans. </p><p>\n  GHG Protocol, which has been developing the standards for the past two decades, said regulatory attention was a big reason for its review. </p><p>\n  \"GHG Protocol is planning additional guidance to enhance implementation of its standards and align with accounting rules under development,\" said Pankaj Bhatia, director of GHG Protocol at the World Resources Institute, a climate-focused nonprofit. </p><p>\n  Companies and investors world-wide rely on the GHG Protocol's guidelines to set \"net zero\" pledges to neutralize emissions and measure progress toward low-carbon goals. More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies use GHG Protocol's standards, the group claims. </p><p>\n  Well over 1,000 companies set greenhouse-gas-reduction targets, according to the Science Based Targets initiative, which helps firms set goals to trim their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Investors look at such numbers to determine whether the companies they fund are eco-friendly. But as the standards take on more importance, some critics are questioning whether they reflect companies' true carbon footprints. </p><p>\n  Some of the sharpest scrutiny focuses on how the standards handle scope 2, or greenhouse-gas emissions associated with companies' energy purchases. Those concerns prompted the GHG Protocol to ask Anders Bjorn, a postdoctoral fellow at Concordia University in Montreal who has done research questioning some target-setting methodologies, to look into the issue, Mr. Bjorn and a person familiar with the matter said. Another Concordia researcher is reviewing the scope 1 and 3 guidelines. </p><p>\n  Currently, the GHG Protocol's scope 2 guidance lets companies say they are procuring renewable energy and thus have lower emissions, even if they are consuming electricity the ordinary way off the power grid. </p><p>\n  Because companies can't control what kind of electricity they are getting from that shared grid, which can include everything from coal-fired power plants to nuclear facilities, many resort to buying financial instruments that let them take credit for the \"greenness\" of carbon-free power. </p><p>\n  In some cases, those instruments -- known in the U.S. as renewable energy certificates -- are sold separately from the actual energy generated. RECs have historically been very cheap, giving companies an inexpensive way to report reduced emissions and leading to fears that those claims could be misleading. </p><p>\n  Big companies can claim the grid's green power for accounting purposes while the dirtier energy on the same grid is attributed to homeowners or other power consumers, critics say, noting that the practice may not reduce overall emissions at all. </p><p>\n  If \"I drive my Hummer to work every day, can I go buy a walk-to-work certificate from some guy on the other side of town that walks to work every day and say my emissions are zero?\" asked Michael Gillenwater, co-founder of the Greenhouse Gas Management Initiative, a Seattle nonprofit focused on emissions accounting. </p><p>\n  Mr. Gillenwater, along with Mr. Brander, worked on the GHG Protocol's scope 2 guidance before it was released in 2015, but expressed concerns over the final product. </p><p>\n  Advocates say the standard has encouraged more companies to commit to clean-power targets, which spurred utilities to build more solar and wind projects and governments to create policies encouraging their construction. </p><p>\n  \"What companies are doing is sending a very clear market signal,\" said Sam Kimmins, who heads RE100, a group for firms that pledged to shift to 100% renewable energy. RE100 has nearly 360 members including Apple, AstraZeneca and General Motors Co. </p><p>\n  William Gore-Randall, a director at Lazard Asset Management in London, said he became skeptical when he realized how little financial instruments like RECs cost, allowing companies to declare big emissions reductions on the cheap. \"Companies are merely putting lip service behind it but not putting money behind it,\" he said. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Companies Hone </p><p>\n  Climate Efforts </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  More companies, including Apple and Salesforce.com Inc., say they are trying to ensure their renewable-energy purchases actually do reduce emissions by trying to contract from new green-power projects that they helped finance. </p><p>\n  Companies like Microsoft Corp. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google say they are testing ways of more accurately matching renewable-energy buys with power consumption on an hourly basis. </p><p>\n  Salesforce claims it achieved 100% renewable energy for its operations, using the current standard, but it set tougher greenhouse-gas-reduction targets for 2030 that encompass total emissions on the grids in which it works, said Max Scher, who heads Salesforce's clean energy and carbon programs. The world is counting on big companies during the next decade to dramatically boost the amount of renewable energy, he said. With the current scope 2 accounting standard, \"there's a world in which . . . we get [to 2030] and the physical reality of the grid hasn't changed very much,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
