  "title": "RNC sues Pelosi, Jan. 6 panel over subpoena for Salesforce records",
  "text": "<p>The subpoena, issued on Feb. 23, seeks evidence that Republican fundraising efforts spreading falsehoods that the 2020 election was stolen contributed to the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021. The RNC's fundraising platform is hosted by software giant Salesforce CRM.</p><p>In a statement Wednesday, the RNC said it filed suit to keep the committee “from unlawfully seizing confidential information about the internal activities of the Republican Party and millions of its supporters which is completely unrelated to the attack on the Capitol,” calling the subpoena “overly broad” and accusing Pelosi and the committee of “weaponizing” their investigative powers.</p><p>Also read:First trial of U.S. Capitol riot defendant ends in conviction on all counts</p><p>“Salesforce collects and maintains significant amounts of RNC data,” the RNC said, and the subpoena “jeopardizes exposing the personal and private data of up to 60 million Americans” as well as GOP strategy. “The RNC had nothing to do with the violence that occurred at the Capitol and has repeatedly condemned it,” they said.</p><p>In a statement Wednesday, Jan. 6 committee spokesperson Tim Mulvey responded that the subpoena has “absolutely nothing to do with getting the private information of voters or donors.”</p><p>“Claims about a stolen election motivated rioters who stormed the Capitol on January 6th,” he said, adding that the subpoena is intended “to help investigators understand the impact of false, inflammatory messages in the weeks before January 6th, the flow of funds, and whether contributions were actually directed to the purpose indicated.”</p>",
