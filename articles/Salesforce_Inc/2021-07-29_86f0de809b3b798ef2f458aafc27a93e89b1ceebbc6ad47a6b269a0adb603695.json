  "text": "<p>Chief executive officer Sundar Pichai told Google employees in a note Wednesday that the Mountain View, Calif., company would begin requiring anyone on its U.S. campuses to be vaccinated in the coming weeks. He said Google would expand that requirement to other countries in future months.</p><p>Mr. Pichai said he hoped that the vaccination requirement would give its more than 135,000 employees across more than a dozen states and 50 countries \"greater peace of mind as offices open.\"</p><p>\"Getting vaccinated is one of the most important ways to keep ourselves and our communities healthy in the months ahead,\" he said.</p><p>He added that accommodations would be made for people who can't be vaccinated for medical or other protected reasons. Those whose reasons are political will be asked to continue to work from home and speak with human resources regarding their options.</p><p>Facebook said employees coming to work on any of its U.S. campuses would need to be vaccinated, though how the policy is implemented will depend on local regulations. Lori Goler, a vice president of people at Facebook, said the company has a process for working with those who choose not to receive a vaccine for medical or other reasons. She added that the company will \"be evaluating our approach in other regions as the situation evolves.\"</p><p>Google and Facebook are among the largest companies in the U.S. to introduce a vaccination requirement. The mandates come on the heels of similar requirements introduced in recent days by federal and local governments eager to boost vaccination rates, which have stalled across the country at 49%.</p><p>Other companies have said they would reopen offices initially only to vaccinated employees. Salesforce.com Inc. in April said vaccinated employees who voluntarily disclosed their status would be allowed back in offices in places such as San Francisco in groups of about 100 people at a time.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, Netflix Inc. told its producers it would require everyone working in close contact with actors on U.S. productions to be vaccinated, a spokesman confirmed.</p><p>Vaccine mandates at work have been rare because they can prompt employee lawsuits and force confrontation with noncompliant staff, employment attorneys say.</p><p>At Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust, a roughly 775-person bank based in Louisiana, executives discussed imposing a vaccine mandate but decided against it, feeling that wasn't the role of a private business, said CEO Guy T. Williams. Instead, Mr. Williams has strongly encouraged vaccinations for all workers, including by appealing to their political inclinations. If employees identify as Republicans, he said, he would emphasize the shots' development under the Trump administration. Among Democrats, Mr. Williams points to President Biden's efforts to get more Americans vaccinated.</p><p>On Wednesday, Lyft Inc. pushed back its planned office reopening to February from September, according to an internal memo from CEO Logan Green viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Also Wednesday, Twitter Inc. said it would close its offices in New York and San Francisco and pause future office reopenings. Those moves followed Apple Inc.'s decision last week to delay its return to the office by at least a month. On Wednesday, Apple said it would require employees in its corporate offices and workers in its stores to wear masks even if they have been vaccinated.</p><p>---</p><p>Preetika Rana contributed to this article.</p>",
