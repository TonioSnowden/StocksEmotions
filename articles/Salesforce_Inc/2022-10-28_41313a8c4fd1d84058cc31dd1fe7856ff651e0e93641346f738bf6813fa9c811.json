  "title": "Elon Musk Moves Swiftly to Put Imprint on Twitter After Takeover; Completion of deal for social-media platform spurs widespread reaction ranging from enthusiasm to concern",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Musk's $44 billion takeover, more than six months in the making, launches a new period of tumult for one of the world's most influential platforms as he works to remake business and content practices that he has repeatedly criticized. The acquisition teed up a host of questions that could take months or years to answer about how Twitter will change in the hands of the world's richest man, who has business interests in autos, rockets and other sectors stretching across the globe and who is one of the platform's most prominent—and sometimes most provocative—users.</p><p>The most immediate changes, following the transfer of control late Thursday, came within Twitter itself. Mr. Musk immediately ousted Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal after the deal closed, The Wall Street Journal reported. He also fired Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's top legal and policy executive, and Sean Edgett, general counsel. Spokespeople for Twitter didn't comment.</p><p>Hours after those actions, Mr. Musk tweeted: \"the bird is freed\" in a seeming reference to Twitter, which has a blue bird as its logo. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday confirmed the deal closed Thursday, and that Twitter is now part of Mr. Musk's X Holdings I Inc.</p><p>Timeline: How the Deal Went Down</p><p>Musk acquired Twitter after a monthslong legal fight. Some key moments.</p><p>The reaction to the deal was far-reaching and included politicians, regulators and business titans. It ran the gamut of enthusiasm to alarm and humor.</p><p>Marc Benioff, who runs Salesforce Inc. alongside Bret Taylor, until Thursday Twitter's chairman, tweeted \"the bird is fried,\" with a picture of a plate of food. A top European Union official warned Mr. Musk about complying with the bloc's new rules on social-media moderation.</p><p>Mr. Musk on Friday tweeted that Twitter would be \"forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.\"</p><p>Former President Donald Trump—permanently banned by Twitter on Jan. 8, 2021, in connection with the U.S. Capitol riot over tweets that company executives viewed as likely to inspire violence—said \"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands.\" The platform needed to \"work hard to rid itself of all of the bots and fake accounts that have hurt it so badly,\" Mr. Trump said on the social-media platform he set up after his Twitter ban. Twitter would be smaller, but better, the former president said.</p><p>His former account remained suspended on Twitter as of early Friday.</p><p>Mr. Musk has previously said that he disagreed with the ban and would restore Mr. Trump's account access, though Mr. Trump said at the time that he didn't intend to return to the platform.</p><p>In Friday's tweet, the new Twitter boss said, \"No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.\"</p><p>Within hours of taking over Twitter, Mr. Musk responded to a tweet about continued content moderation on the platform, saying \"I will be digging in more today.\"</p><p>Lack of content moderation has been a cause of concern for some advertisers, politicians and users who would prefer a more moderated platform. Mr. Musk, even before closing the deal for Twitter, on Thursday reached out to advertisers that underpin the bulk of the company's revenue to assuage them.</p><p>Mr. Musk said he was buying the company to \"have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner.\" He said Twitter \"cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!\"</p><p>Mr. Musk said the platform must be \"warm and welcoming to all\" and suggested Twitter could let people \"choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.\"</p><p>He had previously indicated unhappiness with some of the top ranks at Twitter who have now been fired, at one point responding to a tweet from Mr. Agrawal with a poop emoji. He also used the site to mock Ms. Gadde, the top legal boss, tweeting an image overlaid with text that repeated allegations Twitter had a left-wing political bias. Messrs. Agrawal and Segal are walking away with multimillion-dollar pay packages.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear who would step into the top positions left vacant by Thursday's exits. Mr. Musk listed himself as \"Chief Twit\" in his Twitter bio.</p><p>Mr. Musk became Twitter's boss by offering in April to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, higher than the company was valued at the time. In the months since the deal was struck, Twitter has faced efforts by Mr. Musk to abandon the deal, a whistleblower complaint in which Twitter's former head of security accused the company of security and privacy problems, and unsuccessful talks to negotiate a lower price with Mr. Musk. He pivoted again early this month and agreed to see the deal through.</p><p>The New York Stock Exchange suspended Twitter shares from trading, starting Friday. The stock closed Thursday at $53.70.</p><p>Mr. Musk's takeover leaves big questions over the future of the platform, including how he might revamp its business model and how he might implement changes he has proposed for the way it polices content. He could return Twitter to public ownership after a few years, the Journal previously reported.</p><p>Like other social-media companies, Twitter relies heavily on digital advertising and has faced headwinds in recent months due to broad economic uncertainty. It will also be saddled with billions in debt as a result of the deal, and payments on those loans will add costs for a company that has posted a loss in eight of its past 10 fiscal years.</p><p>Mr. Segal, in a tweet confirming his departure, said the company had been working on \"building the world's town square for all of our stakeholders.\" He added that \"the work isn't complete, but we made meaningful progress.\"</p><p>By taking Twitter private, the billionaire entrepreneur likely can take more risks to jump-start the company's business.</p><p>\"It's going to be bumpy,\" said Youssef Squali, lead internet analyst at Truist Securities. \"He can take it away for a couple of years, really kind of re-engineer the whole thing,\" Mr. Squali said.</p><p>Meghan Bobrowsky contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alexa Corse at alexa.corse@wsj.com</p><p>Elon Musk Moves Swiftly to Put Imprint on Twitter After Takeover</p>",
