  "text": "<p>   Cloud software giant Salesforce Inc. launched a new management training program last year that allows both new managers and experienced bosses to select courses based on skills they believe they need for managing in the hybrid world. More than 24,000 managers have voluntarily signed up. </p><p>   Internal employee polling at Salesforce reinforced the growing importance of direct manager communication: While employees once considered top executives their most-trusted source of company information, that dynamic flipped during the pandemic. Now, employees rate their immediate supervisor as most important to understanding the organization and its priorities, above the executive team. </p><p>   \"What became really important is: What is my manager saying?\" said Brent Hyder, president and chief people officer at Salesforce. </p><p>   With that increased importance comes additional scrutiny. Salesforce managers with more than five employees can see an internal scoreboard that ranks their effectiveness compared with other managers in the company, based on twice-annual surveys among a manager's direct reports. Since the company began tallying its \"great leadership score\" two years ago, Mr. Hyder said, ratings have improved: About 90% of employees now say their bosses are doing what they need to do to make employees successful. </p><p>   \"It puts a lot of pressure on our managers to make sure they are holding their one-on-ones\" with employees and managing them appropriately, Mr. Hyder said. \"Managers,\" he added, \"have always been important, but they've never been this important.\" </p><p>   A reset in the relationship between employees and employers is presenting new challenges for bosses, even at companies that have no trouble attracting new workers. Bob Sternfels, the top executive at consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co., said he encounters employees who now consider the expectations of their jobs compared with their own interests, or \"what I want to do.\" </p><p>   The global managing partner said new workers also want a commitment that they will be able to learn new skills. \"I'm hearing that louder than ever.\" </p><p>    Dave Regnery, CEO of heating-and-air-conditioning manufacturer Trane Technologies PLC, said he became aware of the changing dynamic between companies and employees when a call with about 350 interns took an unexpected turn. </p><p>   The executive spent more than an hour explaining Trane's values and answering questions. He told the young professionals to think of their internships as extended job interviews. </p><p>   Near the end of the call, he said one intern told him: \"I want you to know that this is also a long interview\" for the company. </p><p>   \"Has the relationship changed?\" Mr. Regnery said. \"Yeah. I think it's changed in a positive way.\" </p><p></p>",
