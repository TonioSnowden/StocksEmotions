  "text": "<p>BlackRock BLK oversees a key corporate-debt exchange-traded fund (ETF) that it says now trades at a higher annual daily volume than shares of most blue-chip companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA.</p><p>Daily trading volumes of the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG, climbed to more than $2 billion through the end of 2020, topping the volume of shares of 25 out of 30 stocks in the Dow (see chart).</p><p>BlackRockThat put trading volumes of the popular ETF above individual shares of major household names, including Intel Corp. INTC, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM and Walmart Inc. WMT, when averaging over a year.</p><p>By that measure, trading in HYG only was outpaced by five stocks out of 30 in the Dow benchmark: Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Boeing Co. BA, Walt Disney Co. DIS and Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, while operating at a narrow bid-ask spread of 1 basis point, according to Steve Laipply, head of U.S. Bond&#xa0;ETFs&#xa0;at BlackRock.</p><p>“Over the past several years, bond&#xa0;ETF&#xa0;adoption has accelerated dramatically — and to an even greater degree in 2020 — especially among institutional investors,” Laipply wrote, in a client note.</p><p>Sort of like Twitter</p><p>HYG, with $20 billion in assets under management, is the biggest U.S. ETF of its kind tracking the nearly $1.6 trillion U.S. corporate bond market, or debt issued by American companies historically considered at high risk of default.</p><p>Its next biggest ETF competitor is the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK, with $9 billion in assets under management. Combined, they make up less than $30 billion in assets, or a drop in the bucket when compared with the broader U.S. high-yield bond market.</p><p>Put another way, ETFs, sort of like Twitter, have become a way to gain a regularly updated glimpse into what's happening.</p><p>“For that reason, it becomes somewhat all-consuming,” said Ken Monaghan, co-head of high-yield at Amundi U.S., in a phone interview.</p><p>While his team isn't currently using ETFs, they may serve as an early line of defense during times of tumult, he said, since shares can be a quicker — and ideally less painful — way to sell exposure when redemptions pick up.</p><p>“What a portfolio manager is trying to do is when a market really goes into a tailspin,” Monaghan said, is not to “sell bonds that are down 10 points, because that would be crystallizing a loss — and you're trying not to do that.”</p><p>What liquidity is, isn't</p><p>On the other hand, junk-bond ETFs can skid as quickly as stocks, which was the case in March 2020 (see chart), before the Federal Reserve and other global central banks unleashed a raft of emergency pandemic aid.</p><p>FactSet“Liquidity is all good, until it's not,” said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates, pointing to junk-bond ETF shares that fell sharply at the onset of the pandemic, because prices still remain tethered to clearing levels for bonds they reference.</p><p>“You've got this honey pot of liquidity drawing in the big bears,” Doty said. “But they are going to&#xa0;destroy liquidity when they decided to sell at the same time. I am leery of it.”</p><p>Even so, defaults this year by U.S. high-yield, or “junk rated,” companies have been heading toward all-time lows, following a deluge early on during the pandemic. Debt issuance also has boomed to records, yields have flirted with all-time lows and the Federal Reserve has kept liquidity pumping through markets, despite inflation pressures heating up.</p><p>See: Corporate America's borrowing binge seen barely slowing as Federal Reserve tapers</p><p>Against that backdrop, the cumulative total return for HYG was 9.4% on Monday from two years ago, compared with 55% for the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, according to FactSet.</p>",
