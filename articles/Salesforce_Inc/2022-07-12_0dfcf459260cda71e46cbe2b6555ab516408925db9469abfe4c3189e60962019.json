  "title": "Mubadala Leads $400 Million Investment in Insurer Wefox; The transaction involving existing investors values the all-digital property and casualty carrier at about $4.5 billion",
  "text": "<p>The company intends to use the new capital injection for product development and international expansion. Initially, Wefox intends to add more markets in Europe, where it already operates in Austria, Poland, Switzerland and Italy in addition to Germany. It plans to enter the Netherlands this year and the U.S. and Asia in 2024.</p><p>Wefox provides an all-digital system to obtain and manage certain types of personal insurance coverage. The company is also building a platform that will allow other insurers to use Wefox's technology, paying Wefox a transaction fee based on volume, said Julian Teicke, the chief executive and a co-founder of Wefox.</p><p>\"We want to be the backbone of the digitization of the insurance industry,\" Mr. Teicke said. Supported by German insurer Munich Re, which offers reinsurance as well as product development and data analysis, Wefox says it has more than 2 million customers for its property and casualty products, which include auto, home contents and personal liability coverage and are sold through advisers and brokers.</p><p>Mr. Teicke started the company in 2015 with Fabian Wesemann and Dario Fazlic and it has grown rapidly in recent years. Wefox aims to have 3 million customers by the end of 2022.</p><p>The current market downturn offers an opportunity for further growth, Mr. Teicke said, adding that Wefox has seen strong demand in recent months and has more than doubled its workforce to 1,300 people from about 550 last year.</p><p>\"When there's a downturn, people actually increase their coverage to protect what they still have,\" he said. While fraud often rises during hard economic times, Wefox has invested heavily in fraud-detection technology, he said.</p><p>Revenue for the global insurtech market stood at about $3.85 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $152.43 billion by 2030, according to market researcher Grand View Research. Straits Research, another market researcher, put the global revenue last year at $3.77 billion and projects it to reach $114.49 billion by 2030.</p><p>Wefox expects to generate more than $600 million in revenue this year, compared with about $320 million last year and $143 million in 2020. This year through April, the company reported more than $200 million in revenue.</p><p>Since the company's beginnings, investors have committed more than $1.3 billion to Wefox. Salesforce Ventures, the investing arm of software company Salesforce Inc., was first in, backing the startup with a $5.5 million seed investment in 2016.</p><p>Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com</p><p>Mubadala Leads $400 Million Investment in Insurer Wefox</p>",
