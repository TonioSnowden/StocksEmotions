  "title": "Salesforce tops $7 billion in quarterly revenue for first time, executives focusing on Slack instead of looking for new acquisitions",
  "text": "<p>Salesforce&#xa0;CRM shares gained 4% after hours, following a 0.8% decline in the regular session to close at $208.89.</p><p>On the call with analysts, Marc Benioff, Salesforce&#xa0;chairman and co-chief executive, remarked how acquisitions like Slack and Tableau Software, its largest acquisition until Slack, have transformed the company.</p><p>“Recently, I was actually in the White House with a Fortune 100 CEO who turned to me and said, ‘I start every day with Slack,'” Benioff told analysts on the call. “And this is not a customer that we have even a big&#xa0;Salesforce&#xa0;footprint. And I said to myself, these acquisitions, they have just opened so many doors for us and transformed who we are and the conversation that we can have.”</p><p>A little over a year ago, analysts were questioning whether buying Slack was a good move for the company. Salesforce said that $592 million of its $14.19 billion in revenue from the third and fourth quarters was from Slack. The company's $27.7 billion acquisition of Slack&#xa0;closed on July 21.</p><p>On the call, Co-Chief Executive Bret Taylor said Slack was the company's focus, and that “material” M&amp;A was not, at least in the near term.</p><p>“Slack continues to exceed our expectations in every way,” Taylor said. “It's in the middle of it for every single one of our customer conversations.”</p><p>“It's one of the most exciting acquisitions we've ever done,” Taylor told analysts. “It's critical that we did that at that time, setting up for the future work.”</p><p>That sort of optimism helps as the company's operating margin took a big hit in the fourth quarter, dropping to 15% from 19.8% on a sequential basis. Back in May, analysts debated whether Salesforce's&#xa0;operating margins&#xa0;could be better after the company had forecast operating margins of 18% for the year.</p><p>For the year, margins were 18.7%. Salesforce forecast operating margins of about 20%. On the call, Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver said M&amp;A is expected to contribute a 100- to 125-basis-point headwind to margins.</p><p>Salesforce expects adjusted first-quarter earnings of 93 cents to 94 cents a share on revenue of $7.37 billion to $7.38 billion, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast $1 a share on revenue of $7.27 billion.</p><p>For fiscal 2023, Salesforce forecasts adjusted earnings of $4.62 to $4.64 a share on revenue of $32 billion to $32.1 billion, with analysts expecting $4.76 a share on revenue of $31.78 billion.</p><p>The company reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $28 million, or 3 cents a share, versus income of $267 million, or 28 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 84 cents a share, compared with $1.04 a share in the year-ago period.</p><p>Revenue rose to $7.33 billion from $5.82 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $7.24 billion, based Salesforce's forecast of 72 cents to 73 cents a share on revenue of $7.22 billion to $7.23 billion.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, Salesforce shares have declined 4%, while the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF&#xa0;IGV has declined 8%, the S&amp;P 500 index&#xa0;SPX&#xa0;has gained 10%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index&#xa0;COMP has slid 0.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average&#xa0;DJIA — which counts Salesforce as a component — has gained 6%.</p>",
