  "title": "Thursday's Markets:  Stocks Fall to Snap Advances  ---  S&P 500 ends a rally  as investors assess  domestic product data,  weekly jobless figures  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein and Akane Otani",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. stocks wobbled, snapping a streak of gains and backing away from records hit earlier in the week. </p><p>   Stocks started the day mixed, then steadily gave up ground throughout the afternoon. All but one of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors ended the day lower, with energy shares posting among the biggest losses. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 declined 26.19 points, or 0.6%, to 4470.00, bringing an end to its recent streak of gains and retreating from Wednesday's all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 96.05 points, or 0.6%, to 14945.81, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 192.38 points, or 0.5%, to 35213.12. </p><p>   Heading into the end of the week, money managers say their focus is largely on comments expected from Federal Reserve officials on Friday that could offer cues on the central bank's plans for tapering stimulus measures. Some investors are betting that the Fed may slow those plans if there are signs that the economic recovery is faltering. </p><p>   Data on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy grew 6.6% on an annualized basis in the second quarter, an upward revision from the initial print last month. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims came in at 353,000, a slight increase from the previous week's pandemic low. Economists were expecting the level to be relatively unchanged. </p><p>   \"Risk assets have done well this last week, and as we go into the Fed event, there is some profit-taking,\" said Shaniel Ramjee, multiasset fund manager at Pictet Asset Management. \"No one can honestly say they know what's going to happen; this uncertainty will put some reduction on risk.\" </p><p>   Among individual stocks, Salesforce.com rose $6.94, or 2.7%, to $267.79 after the business-software company reported a jump in quarterly sales and raised its full-year outlook on Wednesday evening. </p><p>   Home-goods retailer Williams-Sonoma jumped $15.94, or 9.3%, to $186.68 after increasing its quarterly dividend and share-buyback program. </p><p>   Software developer Autodesk fell $32.08, or 9.4%, to $310.19, posting its biggest one-day percentage decline since April 2020, after it delivered guidance for third-quarter earnings that came in below analysts' estimates. </p><p>   Zoom Video Communications added $2.89, or 0.9%, to $340.63 after an equity research analyst at Morgan Stanley raised their rating on the stock. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 0.3%. </p><p>   Among European equities, Deutsche Bank's DWS Group tumbled 14% following a report by The Wall Street Journal that the asset-management firm is being probed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors over sustainability claims. </p><p>   In Asia, most major benchmarks declined by the close of trading. The Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index retreated over 1%. </p><p>   South Korea's Kospi Index slid 0.6%. The nation's central bank raised its key policy rate, becoming the first major Asian one to do so since the pandemic began. The Korean won depreciated 0.3% against the dollar. </p><p></p>",
