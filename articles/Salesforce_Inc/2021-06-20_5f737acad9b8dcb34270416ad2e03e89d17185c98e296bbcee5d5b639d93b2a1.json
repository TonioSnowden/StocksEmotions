  "text": "<p>Microsoft and Alphabet have pushed back against calls to include disclosures on environmental, social and governance issues in key US regulatory filings, setting them on course for a tussle with major asset managers.</p> <p>The tech companies told the top US securities watchdog that ESG information should not be included in a type of filing known as a 10k, which most public groups must submit each year. Microsoft and Alphabet said including ESG information in these filings would open them up to potential legal risks since such data are subject to more uncertainty than the detailed financials and risk disclosures that are currently required in 10ks. </p> <p>The duo's submission in recent days to the Securities and Exchange Commission sets up a clash with Pimco, Invesco and other large asset managers that want ESG information to be included in 10ks. The SEC is planning to make the disclosures mandatory and is considering where they should be made.</p> <p>Josh Zinner, chief executive of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which includes religious organisations and other ESG-minded investors, said such disclosures would create a “more level playing field and highlight these companies' leadership”.</p> <p>The annual 10k filings must be signed off by companies' chief executive and financial officers, and are also reviewed by SEC staff, making them one of the most important types of disclosures for public companies. </p> <p>Microsoft and Alphabet, Zinner said, “position themselves as sustainability leaders and they should certainly be supportive of mandatory disclosure on ESG matters, including in their regulatory filings where they would be accountable for the content of this information”.</p> <p>The battle between asset managers and companies over ESG disclosure is expected to intensify in coming months. With global warming and human rights posing new risks for companies, the SEC has embarked on unprecedented disclosure rulemaking for the booming ESG sector.</p> <p>In 2021, almost a third of global equity inflows have gone into ESG funds, Bank of America said in a June 1 report. Assets under management in ESG funds hit a record $1.4tn in April, more than double the level from a year ago and growing at nearly 3 times the rate of non-ESG assets, the bank said.</p> <p>Microsoft and Alphabet have benefited from this surge. Microsoft is the most widely held company in US ESG funds, Bank of America said. Alphabet is among the top 10 most popular ESG companies and is held in almost half of all US ESG funds. </p> <p>Alphabet joined other technology companies on <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12-8907252-244227.pdf\">an SEC letter</a> last week that recommended ESG disclosures “be furnished via separate climate reporting to the SEC”.</p> <p>“Given that climate disclosures rely on estimates and assumptions that involve inherent uncertainty, it is important not to subject companies to undue liability, including from private parties,” the companies said.</p> <p>If companies are worried about getting sued, it could hurt the SEC's overall goal of providing more ESG data to the market, said Patrick Flynn, vice-president for sustainability at Salesforce, one of the signatories to the letter. “It's a new process for companies to go through, and they'll need to establish new procedures. Allowing for some sort of safe harbour from liability . . . [allows] companies to push in willingly and not just do the bare minimum.”</p> <p>Microsoft said <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12-8914472-244721.pdf\">its SEC letter</a> was not intended to imply that climate disclosures stay out of SEC filings entirely. It said its cycle for compiling and verifying climate data might not align with the year-end financial statements.</p> <p>While it will continue to provide ESG disclosures outside of SEC filings, Microsoft said “we believe climate disclosures in SEC filings should be limited to information that is material to an investment or voting decision with respect to the company”.</p> <p>Alphabet declined to comment.</p> <p>“While it's great to see corporate ESG leaders advocating for the SEC to adopt climate disclosure standards, we disagree with their assertion that these disclosures should fall outside current standard SEC filings”, said Molly Betournay, director of shareholder advocacy at Clean Yield Asset Management. “Standard climate reporting should be included in regular SEC filings.”</p> <p><br>&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Patrick Temple-West and Billy Nauman in New York 2021 'Top tech groups try to dilute ESG disclosure rules' FT.com 20 June.
