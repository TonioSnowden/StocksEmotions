  "title": "Think you had a bad week? Salesforce, cloud companies had some of their worst weeks ever; Atlassian , Twilio stocks both shed a third of their value Friday on their worst day yet, and other cloud-software declines are sending ETFs tracking the industry to their worst week on record amid forecasts that show slowing growth",
  "text": "<p>It was the worst week ever for the Global X Cloud Computing ETF CLOU, which finished down 11.3%. Meanwhile, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY managed to score only it's third worst week on record with a 10.9% drop.</p><p>But the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD managed to avoid its worst week ever by 2 basis points when it closed down 14.74% Friday, just short of the 14.76% drop for the week ending March 13, 2020, according to FactSet data.</p><p>Leading the race for the bottom for cloud-software were shares of Atlassian Inc. TEAM and Twilio TWLO</p><p>Atlassian shares sank 38.4% this week, beating out their former worst of 20.4% for the week ending Jan. 7, 2022. Late Thursday, Atlassian execs said customers were converting to paid subscriptions from freemium versions at a slower pace. Twilio caught a two-notch downgrade from B. of A. Securities analyst Michael Funk before the company forecast a poor outlook.</p><p>Those declines bled over to the largest cloud-software names as well Friday, even as most have yet to report earnings this season. For the week, Salesforce Inc. CRM shares dropped 14.9% for their worst week since the one ending Aug. 19, 2011, and Service Now Inc. NOW shares fell 14.6% for the week.</p><p>Workday Inc. WDAY shares dropped 15.9% over the week for their worst ever, and Okta Inc. OKTA shares fell 21.2% over the week for their second worst ever, their worst being the week ending Sept. 2 over which shares shed 30.9% .</p><p>Snowflake Inc. SNOW shares dropped 17.2% over the week, and MongoDB Inc. MDB shares dropped 22.1% over the week, according to FactSet data.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of cybersecurity company Cloudflare Inc. NET shares logged their worst week ever with a 25.8% decline, following earnings late Thursday, weighing down other names in the space like Zscaler Inc. ZS, which finished the week for its second worst ever at a 21.4% stock price decline, and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD, which also saw their stock having their second worst ever with a 22.1% fall.</p><p>Fortinet Inc. FTNT kicked off that decline Thursday, after forecasting fourth-quarter billings late Wednesday that undershot analysts' expectations, sending shares down 18.7% in Friday</p><p>Read: Security-software stocks are suffering from this one gloomy forecast</p><p>Cybersecurity stocks specifically were heading for their worst week in 2Â½ years, with the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF HACK down 9.6%, its worst since a 9.9% drop the week ended March 13, 2020. The First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF CIBR was down 9.8%, its worst week since early 2020.</p><p>Companies like Atlassian and Twilio were seen as a strong bet heading into a recession, as cloud software can help to reduce costs from legacy software as well as create efficiencies within organizations. Raymond James analyst Adam Tindle, in detailing the read-throughs on Atlassian's report, explained how that view is now changing on Wall Street.</p><p>Atlassian's results \"suggest even the most diversified, low cost, visible growth models (cloud transition) are not immune to this brutal macro environment and shares are de-rating accordingly,\" Tindle said in a note.</p><p>Cowen analyst Derrick Wood, who has a market perform rating on Atlassian, characterized the company's miss on billings as \"rare,\" and also pointed out another weakness.</p><p>As layoffs and hiring freezes are playing out across the tech industry, Wood said fewer big customers are growing out their capacity because of fewer developers being hired.</p><p>\"We see Atlassian enjoying incumbency advantages alongside low-cost products, but the company is undergoing a multi-year model transition to the cloud and shift in pricing structure; meanwhile there have been several formidable competitors entering the market with compelling consumer-grade software packages,\" the Cowen analyst said.</p><p>Then again, Atlassian sees the problem as an opportunity, as in hiring talent from a large pool,especially with layoffs from companies like Elon Musk-owned Twitter.</p><p>\"There's a lot of incredible people in the market who may only come on the market once a decade and may have an opportunity to pick those staff up now,\" said Scott Farquhar, Atlassian co-chief executive and co-founder on a conference call with analysts. \"And so, we've been really thoughtful around kind of how many we hire and where we hire.\"</p><p>\"But our experiences that we can come out really strong on the other side by selectively picking out staff that other people letting go,\" Farquhar said.</p><p>Of the various cloud-computing ETFs year to date, CIBR is faring best with a 28% drop, and WCLD is performing the worst with a 55% drop, compared with a 21% fall on the S&amp;P 500 index SPX and a 33% drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index.
