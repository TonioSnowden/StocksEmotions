Talking to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/you-need-to-reinvent-your-wfh-day-from-scratch-literally_uk_6023f451c5b6c56a89a5f4a8\">Huffpost's Amy Packham</a>, Auerbach&#xa0;invites home-workers to reinvent their 9-to-5 workday from scratch and \"shed the rhythms that don't suit you\". It's timely advice given Salesforce's much-publicised&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275304/salesfore-remote-work-9-to-5-workday-is-dead-flex-coronavirus\">decision</a>&#xa0;to declare that \"the 9-to-5 workday is dead\".</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Moules' business school news</strong></p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has been a blessing and a curse for business schools. While demand for qualifications such as the MBA rebounded for many schools, the global university-based executive education market, worth close to $2bn in 2019, fell by a third in 2020. The good news is that corporate training budgets are holding up. However, as my colleague Andrew Jack&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eff17124-daed-41c1-9c3e-8b2a617e5ad0?emailId=602a47133956f100041cb16e&amp;segmentId=f5ff1a1a-1590-1863-3861-e9c91a6a3b7f\">writes</a>&#xa0;this week, education providers must adapt to the new world of learning delivered primarily online.</p> <p>Another theme of this year will be entrepreneurship to help rebuild pandemic-hit economies. Many MBA students will be eager to use their time at business school to nurture a start-up idea, but as John Mullins, London Business School professor, notes in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fee31b91-e023-48a2-ba3a-137fe56cce5b?emailId=602a47133956f100041cb16e&amp;segmentId=f5ff1a1a-1590-1863-3861-e9c91a6a3b7f\">my piece</a>&#xa0;on the subject this week, what society really needs is for support to focus on “scale up” companies with the potential to grow fast and generate new jobs.</p> <p>Rather than further reading, this week I would like to suggest some&#xa0;<a href=\"https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/what-it-means-to-embark-on-a-journey-of-change-16071\">listening</a>: a&#xa0;podcast from Insead professor of leadership development and organisational change Manfred Kets de Vries, talking about what it means to embark on a journey of change.</p> <p><strong>Data line</strong></p> <p>Building a network is one of the main reasons why students apply for an MBA. Data from our&#xa0;MBA 2021 ranking show that most alumni are satisfied with various benefits&#xa0;from their network, says Leo Cremonezi.&#xa0;Contact with other graduates&#xa0;and attending events scored highly.
