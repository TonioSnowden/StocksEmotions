  "text": "<p>The US Senate has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f57935c5-cfd7-423c-a55e-6d6a6fb37fd6\">approved legislation which protects the right</a> to same-sex marriage after concerns that it might be at risk of being overturned by the conservative majority of justices on the Supreme Court.</p> <p>The bill passed the upper chamber of Congress by a vote of 61-36. It won bipartisan support as 12 Republicans joined Democrats to adopt the measure, which also enshrines recognition for interracial marriages, saying couples are protected from discrimination regardless of their “sex, race, ethnicity or national origin”.</p> <p>The legislation now heads to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to be approved and sent to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature.</p> <p>The need for the legislation was sparked by the Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn Roe vs Wade, which established the right to an abortion. Justice Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, has suggested the court should revisit other landmark rulings — including Obergefell vs Hodges, the 2015 case recognising same-sex marriage.</p> <p>The legislation passed by the Senate would pre-empt any such decision. “Today, the US Senate stood up to Justice Clarence Thomas's radical, regressive vision for America,” said Dick Durbin, the Democratic chair of the Senate judiciary committee.</p> <p><strong>Dig deeper</strong>: In the ultimate coup for the right, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b188c7dc-8374-47da-9222-a53141a04bbd\">it's Justice Thomas's Supreme Court now.</a></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. US militia leader convicted of seditious conspiracy</strong> Stewart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers, a rightwing militia group, faces up to 20 years in jail after being convicted of seditious conspiracy in connection with the attack on the US Capitol on January 6 2021. The conviction is an important victory for the Department of Justice which has arrested and charged hundreds of individuals accused of storming the Capitol last year. The Rhodes trial was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b10ff0f-46b0-460e-a690-4553edcedce4\">among the most high-profile</a>.</p> <p><strong>2.

He served as general secretary of the ruling Communist party from 1989 to 2002 and, alongside Zhu Rongji, his premier, helped entrench the sweeping market-orientated reforms of Deng Xiaoping. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7ddbb43-7121-401f-bce1-b159bcb3e465\">Find out more</a>.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>UK ready to relax ringfencing rules on some banks </strong>The “ringfencing” of banks with retail and investment arms was introduced after the 2008 financial crash, but critics have said the rules are inefficient.
