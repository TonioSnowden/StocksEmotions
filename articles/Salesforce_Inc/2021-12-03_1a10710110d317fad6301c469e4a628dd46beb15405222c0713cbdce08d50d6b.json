  "title": "Twitter CEO Shakes Up Leadership Team to Spur Change; Moves quickly follow departure of Jack Dorsey late last month",
  "text": "<p>The changes come after Twitter in February set ambitious growth goals. The company said then it aimed to reach at least $7.5 billion in revenue or more by 2023, up from the $3.7 billion it posted last year.</p><p>Twitter in the past has struggled with its technology to deliver revenue and provide data security. Its shares have lagged behind those of digital ad giants Meta Platforms Inc., the parent of Facebook, and Google's Alphabet Inc.</p><p>Twitter last year launched a feature called Fleets for users to post text, photos and videos that vanish after 24 hours, mimicking a concept that has flourished on visual-focused apps like Snapchat, owned by Snap Inc., and Meta's Instagram. Twitter pulled the plug on the effort this year.</p><p>On Monday, it said co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey was stepping down and would exit the company's board when his term expires next year. Mr. Dorsey has come under criticism for running Twitter and financial services company Square Inc., which this week said it was rebranding as Block Inc. Last year, activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed for changes at Twitter before calling a truce.</p><p>As part of the overhaul disclosed Friday in the first major step since Mr. Agrawal was elevated from chief technology officer to CEO, Twitter said its engineering lead, Michael Montano, and Dantley Davis, the design and research lead, will step down from their posts effective Dec. 31. They will remain in an advisory capacity through the end of the first quarter, the company said in its regulatory notice.</p><p>The company said it is naming general managers to oversee functions around consumers, revenue, and core technology. It said Kayvon Beykpour, Bruce Falck, and Nick Caldwell would hold those posts that involve leading teams spanning engineering, product management, design and research.</p><p>In addition, Twitter said Lindsey Iannucci, a senior director at the company, was named to the leadership team as chief of staff and vice president of operations.</p><p>As part of the changes announced earlier this week, Twitter said Salesforce.com Inc. executive Bret Taylor will serve as board chairman. Mr. Taylor this week was named co-CEO at Salesforce alongside co-founder Marc Benioff and vice chairman of the business software company's board.</p><p>Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter CEO Shakes Up Leadership Team to Spur Change</p>",
