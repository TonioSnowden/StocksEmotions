  "title": "Hines, Korean Pension Fund Bet Big on San Francisco Comeback; They plan to redevelop site of PG&E's office campus in San Francisco",
  "text": "<p>The development—one of the biggest in the city's recent history—is a bet on the eventual recovery of San Francisco's commercial real-estate market, which is suffering its worst crisis in decades. Technology firms dominate the city's economy and have embraced remote work more aggressively than other industries. Many tech companies have been slow to bring their employees back to the office, or are reducing their footprint in the expensive city.</p><p>More than one-quarter of San Francisco's office space was available for lease in the second quarter, according to CBRE Group Inc. That is a record. Asking rents for high-end office space were 10% below their 2020 peak. Apartment vacancies are much lower, but rents have tumbled as tech employees left the city to work remotely during the pandemic.</p><p>Hines and its partner were opportunistic buyers. Utility PG&amp;E, which has said it wants to return roughly half of the sales proceeds to its customers, has been looking to cut costs and raise cash to limit rate increases.</p><p>The pandemic pushed down prices, said Alfonso Munk, Hines's chief investment officer for the Americas. \"Now is the right time to get in,\" he said.</p><p>Houston-based Hines hopes that demand for high-end offices will be greater by the time the two office buildings are expected to open, in 2024 and 2025. Senior managing director Paul Paradis said he believes the rising popularity of remote work will lead more companies to ditch old office buildings for newer ones with more natural light and features such as advanced air filtration.</p><p>\"They want a really wonderful workplace to attract more people back so that people want to be at work,\" he said.</p><p>The National Pension Service and Hines plan to renovate an almost 100-year-old, 600,000-square-foot office building on the site. They are considering a more extensive redevelopment of an adjacent 34-story office tower, replacing everything except its foundation and steel frame. The partners want to build the apartment tower on the site of a current parking garage and hope to open it in 2026.</p><p>Hines is one of the developers behind the Salesforce Tower, San Francisco's tallest building, and is currently building an 800-foot hotel, apartment and office tower a few blocks from the PG&amp;E site.</p><p>The National Pension Service is contributing 95% of the money to purchase the PG&amp;E campus, not counting debt, Mr. Munk said. The companies want to bring on other partners to help pay for the development.</p><p>Korean institutions have been among the most aggressive foreign buyersof U.S. commercial real estate during the pandemic, drawn in by low returns on investments in South Korea and by cheaper currency-hedging costs.</p><p>Sales of San Francisco office and apartment buildings surged over the past decade, buoyed by the growth of the city's tech industry. But sales began falling before the pandemic amid fears of stricter rent regulations and rising interest rates, said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital Analytics.</p><p>Investors bought $1.25 billion worth of office buildings in the city in the second quarter, according to RCA—a 26% drop from the second-quarter average during the five years before the pandemic.</p><p>Write to Konrad Putzier at konrad.putzier@wsj.com</p><p>Hines, Korean Pension Fund Bet Big on San Francisco Comeback</p>",
