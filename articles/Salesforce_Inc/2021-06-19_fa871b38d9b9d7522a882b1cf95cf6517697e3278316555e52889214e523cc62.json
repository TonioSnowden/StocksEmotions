  "text": "<p>\n  [The trusted advisers of top business leaders] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Ebony Beckwith occupies a powerful perch as chief philanthropy officer of Salesforce.com Inc. and head of its nonprofit foundation. </p><p>\n  The highest Black executive at the business-software giant leads a global operation that disbursed more than $65 million in charitable grants during the year ended Jan. 31. She reports to Chief Executive Marc Benioff, a rare setup among corporate philanthropy officers. </p><p>\n  As a child, the San Francisco native wanted to be a boss someday. \"Some kids played house. I played boss,\" she remembers. </p><p>\n  As an adolescent, Ms. Beckwith considered pursuing criminal-defense law or journalism. Instead, the high-school graduate developed an interest in programming while a quality-assurance manager for Pacific Bell. She joined Providian Financial Corp., a credit-card issuer, as an operations manager in 1997. </p><p>\n  Salesforce hired Ms. Beckwith in 2008 to be chief of staff for Kirsten Wolgren, its chief information officer. In 2014, she initially resisted Salesforce Foundation's offer of a vice presidency. She ultimately accepted a one-year tryout. Yet her inaugural Salesforce executive role lasted about two years, and \"ended up being a pivotal moment in my career,\" she says. </p><p>\n  Here are four of her trusted advisers. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  David Dinslage </p><p>\n  A retired supervisor at San Francisco Recreation and Park Department </p><p>\n  Ms. Beckwith has known Mr. Dinslage since age 8. That summer, she attended a camp where the San Francisco municipal employee was a counselor. At age 16, she worked for him part-time in his recreation-department office. \"You must believe in yourself,\" Mr. Dinslage told her before her high-school graduation. \"Don't listen to people who say you can't do it.\" To this day, Ms. Beckwith makes a point of surrounding herself with supportive people. They \"have opened doors to help me get to where I am today,\" she remarks. And \"I've hired people who have my back.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Kirsten Wolberg </p><p>\n  Public and private company board member </p><p>\n  Ms. Wolberg suggested that her struggling lieutenant find the courage to seek assistance with her unfinished work because \"asking for help shows strength, self-awareness and confidence,\" the former Salesforce executive says. \"All things that are critical for success.\" Similarly, she stressed the importance of Ms. Beckwith building deep ties with what was then a handful of other female executives at their highly collaborative workplace. \"I knew Ebony would be well-served to have a broad [Salesforce] network.\" Ms. Beckwith soon met a dozen women at the VP level or higher. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Amy Weaver </p><p>\n  Chief financial officer of Salesforce.com Inc. </p><p>\n  Ms. Weaver not only advises her longtime colleague. She sponsors her, too. Shortly after George Floyd's murder last year, she proposed that Salesforce create a task force on racial equality and justice, led by Ms. Beckwith. The philanthropy chief spoke up when company leaders explored the idea -- as Ms. Weaver and others had urged that she do during top management meetings. \"I stepped in to help guide our action,\" such as by pointing out that \"systemic racism did not start overnight,\" Ms. Beckwith recalls. She launched the task force in June 2020. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Robin Washington </p><p>\n  Corporate board member and former CFO of Gilead Sciences Inc. </p><p>\n  The veteran financial executive met Ms. Beckwith after becoming Salesforce's first Black director in 2013. \"I try to model the leadership qualities I know she's capable of and striving to achieve,\" Ms. Washington says. \"You can't be what you can't see.\" She has acted as a valuable sounding board in weighing the merits of a new job inside and outside Salesforce, according to Ms. Beckwith. In addition, Ms. Washington coaches her on skills she might need for future career moves. Ms. Beckwith currently is exploring the possibility of joining a public company board, for example. </p><p></p>",
