  "text": "<p>The Silicon Valley pioneer behind well-known products like Photoshop, Illustrator and the PDF format has long lived in the shadow of some of its much larger software peers of a similar age. But Adobe is no runt: Projected revenue of a little over $20 billion for the next fiscal year ranks the company 10th on the S&amp;P 500 Software &amp; Services Group. And Adobe's highly successful transition to a subscription-based business model has made it the largest company on the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index by market capitalization, outranking even Salesforce.</p><p>That was until Thursday, when Adobe's share price sank 17% after the company's latest results and a surprise deal to acquire a privately held software company called Figma for $20 billion in cash and stock. That is more than four times what Adobe paid for Marketo in 2018, which had been by far the company's largest deal. Analyst Brent Thill of Jefferies noted the price reflects a multiple of about 25 times what Figma's annualized recurring revenue could hit next year if it keeps growing at its current rate. That compares with about 10 times forward revenue Adobe paid for Marketo. In a report on Thursday, Mr. Thill concluded that Adobe's latest move \"looks pricey.\"</p><p>It looks like an established technology giant taking out a growing threat -- a risky move in the current regulatory environment. Figma offers cloud-based tools used by software designers in areas like user interface, thus competing with Adobe's XD service. It has grown popular of late: A report by Macquarie Research earlier this year noted that \"many designers pull Figma into their organizations like developer tools.\" A report by CNBC last month said \"tens of thousands\" of software developers at Microsoft now use Figma -- despite the availability of Adobe's tools through an existing business relationship.</p><p>In a conference call Thursday morning, Adobe claimed the overlap isn't as strong as it might seem as two-thirds of Figma's users aren't from the group of designers that make up Adobe's core customer. But the move comes at a time of weakness; Adobe's fiscal third-quarter results Thursday showed a continued deceleration in its growth. Revenue grew by an average of 14% year over year over the past four quarters, compared with an average of nearly 25% over the previous four periods. And Adobe's revenue forecast for the current fiscal quarter ending in November came in below Wall Street's target for the fourth consecutive period on Thursday. Adobe's shares are down 46% so far this year.</p><p>Figma on its own might not change that trajectory; $400 million in annual revenue is about 2% of what Wall Street expects Adobe's revenue to hit next year. And, despite its growing heft, Adobe is likely too small to have the deal raise alarm bells with regulators. But investors might be justifiably worried that Adobe dug rather deep to fund an expensive cloud acquisition when cloud companies are cheaper than they have been in years.</p><p>The Photoshop maker has its own image to brush up now.</p>",
