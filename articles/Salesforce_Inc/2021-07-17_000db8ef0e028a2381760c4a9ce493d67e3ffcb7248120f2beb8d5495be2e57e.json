  "text": "<p>\n  A: One of the biggest perks of running your own business is you're hiring people that you like. We're all in the trenches together. When something goes wrong, it's all 24 of us hopping on together. Nobody's pointing fingers. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's the most challenging part of your job? </p><p>\n  A: Knowing that the buck always stops with me and my co-founder. Especially during Covid, a lot of things go wrong. There was an aluminum-cans shortage that nobody could see coming and we had to fight for just the aluminum cans. We're not going to be able to produce the product. We're not going to be able to supply our retail partners. We had to go fight against all of the major beverage companies to make sure that they kept our product in stock and after a lot of trials and tribulations, we were able to get it done. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Were your college internships essential to getting to where you are today? </p><p>\n  A: Absolutely. An internship I had at Liberty Mutual selling insurance was my first true sales job. Learning how to cold email, cold call, building relationships with car dealerships and all that kind of stuff. I was 18 and it was an opportunity to hang out with older people and just learn and pick their brains on everything, from my manager all the way down to the entry-level sales reps. From there I went to State Street Bank. That's where I got really good at Salesforce and learned what it's like to build out a CRM [customer relationship management] tool. </p><p>\n  Northeastern is a five-year program, so in my last three years I joined a tech startup in Boston. I was the first sales hire and that business ended up pivoting two or three times. I tell everybody that's where I got my M.B.A. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your best advice for college students who are starting the job hunt? </p><p>\n  A: What's almost as important as finding what you like to do is finding what you don't like. I wrote down everything that was most important to me about a job and ranked it. \"How far is the commute? Do I like the people that I'm working with? Do I like my boss? Is there an ability to grow within this company?\" </p><p>\n  Just start talking to people. If you don't know anyone, hop on LinkedIn and start messaging people. I would joke in my cold emails to people: \"I'm a third-year in college and I've been in sales for 20 years. If you're wondering how, it's because I've been caddying since I was eight years old.\" Something like that, just a way of showing your personality. You'd be amazed how much people are willing to help. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your best advice for someone who realizes their first job isn't a good fit? </p><p>\n  A: Internally you try to find an advocate, whether it's your boss or a co-worker, or just somebody that's a little bit older than you. Be open with them about what's going on, what you don't like and potentially why you don't like it. Is it the industry? Is it the company? I've had friends that just weren't happy in the role they were in and they were able to find a different role within that company. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Numbers Game: The Sports Statistician </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Sergio Santamaria </p><p>\n  Age: 24 </p><p>\n  Location: Detroit </p><p>\n  Title: Data Analyst </p><p>\n  Company: Detroit Pistons </p><p>\n  Time in job: Eight months </p><p>\n  Education: BA, Sports Management and Data Science, Rice University </p><p>\n  Key skills: SQL, Python, R, Excel </p><p>\n  Salary: $60,000 league average for job title </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Sergio Santamaria's childhood obsession with sports went beyond playing basketball, which he did plenty growing up in Houston. </p><p>\n  \"I refused to get excited about a school project if it didn't have something to do with sports,\" says Mr. Santamaria, whose Colombian-born parents moved their family to the U.S. from Ecuador just before his third birthday. \"Videogames, extracurriculars -- everything I did was related to sports.\" </p><p>\n  All that practice paid off, just not on the court. During college, Mr. Santamaria interned for the Houston Rockets, tracking stats, filming games, contributing to scouting reports and wiping down the occasional floor. An internship with the Phoenix Suns turned into a job after graduation, and after a brief stint with a sports-analytics startup, he landed in Detroit as a data analyst for the Pistons. </p><p>\n  Now, Mr. Santamaria works with the team's scouting, coaching, strategy and analytics departments analyzing data and building tools that allow the team to craft its strategies. One of his continuing projects is an internal dashboard that displays current stats, future projections, salary data and staff evaluations for every current NBA player. </p><p>\n  Mr. Santamaria recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal about how a passion for sports led him to pursue a degree in data science. Here's his story, edited and condensed. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What drew you to this kind of work? </p><p>\n  A: A family friend a couple of years older than me who went to Rice had a roommate that was studying sports management and had worked for the Astros and Rice Baseball. Immediately I knew that that's what I wanted to do. </p><p>\n  My first week on campus, I went into [sports management] Prof. Tom Stalling's office and was like, \"I know about sports analytics, and I know that the Houston Rockets are a very advanced and analytically driven organization, and I love basketball, and I know that the department here has connections with the Rockets, and I would love to work there.\" Within a couple of months I was interning for the Rockets and just kept my foot in the door. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: How did you get your current job? Did you apply online? </p><p>\n  A: Every job I've gotten in the sports industry has been network-based. I had built a network over my time in Houston and also in Phoenix. When the new front office here in Detroit was established last summer, my name was lofted to the executives as an analytics employee that had been with the Suns for the previous two years, and the Rockets before that, and was working at a sports-related startup at the time. There was no formal application process. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your typical day like? </p><p>\n  A: Working remotely has been a challenge. I'm extremely extroverted and really crave interactions and being around people. With the Suns in the 2019-20 season, I was traveling with the team. I was on the court with the players and the coaches. This year has been very different because it's been at home, at the computer, creating these tools, these dashboards, these analyses, and starting this job virtually, too. There's a lot of co-workers that I've never even met in person. A lot of it is meetings to understand what people need, what people are looking for. And a lot of watching basketball in the evenings. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's the best part of your job? </p><p>\n  A: The euphoria and excitement and passion that fans show really make you appreciate the job. The things that fans will talk about in the Uber or at the bar or at the water cooler at work: \"Oh man, the Knicks should have traded for him,\" or \"The Pistons should assign them.\" That's all the stuff that I actually get to contribute to and work on in a way. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's the most challenging part of your job? </p><p>\n  A: NBA analytics teams are still really small relative to the technical departments at other companies or other sports leagues. You have to be extremely productive across a variety of different areas. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Did your internships make or break your job hunt? </p><p>\n  A: Without a doubt. I was able to get into the actual industry that I was looking to get into starting my freshman year of college and build on that. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Outside of an internship, what do you think is the most critical thing you did that led to your current job? </p><p>\n  A: Having a positive attitude and being someone that people like spending time with. The sports industry is often more of a lifestyle than a job; it really is a choice that becomes more than your typical 9 to 5. </p><p>\n  And pursuing the technical side of my education was huge. The people that I was in class with are software engineers and project managers and data analysts and developers at the biggest tech companies in the entire world, but I chose to apply those skills to sports. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your best advice for students in college right now who are facing down the job hunt? </p><p>\n  A: The first step is a ton of research and an understanding of what kinds of problems the industry that you're hoping to get into is facing. I was really aware that the NBA was shifting more and more toward analytics and technology and I knew having those skills would serve me really well as a candidate for a job. </p><p>\n  Understanding problems that the industry or the company or the field faces will allow you to craft your skill sets, craft your resume, craft your experiences with the goal of being the missing puzzle piece. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your best advice for someone who realizes their first job isn't a good fit? </p><p>\n  A: The No. 1 lesson is not to discount the opportunities that you have available to you in your current position. Being transfer-focused rather than restart-focused is a really important mind-set to have. Two of the internships that I did in college, I was doing really rigid software engineering, building websites, working eight hours a day coding. I knew pretty early on that wasn't going to be what I wanted to do; I value interpersonal connection and communication and problem solving more than developing websites. </p><p>\n  But I still learned a ton from that experience. I can manage people that have those skill sets. You never know who knows who and you never know what you're going to learn in one place that's going to apply to problems and situations in the next place. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Good Optics: The Eyes Have It </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Gabriella Lanouette </p><p>\n  Age: 25 </p><p>\n  Location: Working remotely from Guilford, Conn.; company is based in New York City </p><p>\n  Title: Full-Stack Machine Learning Engineer </p><p>\n  Company: Orbis International </p><p>\n  Time in the job: Six months </p><p>\n  Education: BS in applied mathematical sciences, University of Connecticut; MS in applied artificial intelligence and machine learning, Columbia University </p><p>\n  Key skills: Python, JavaScript, React, HTML, Java </p><p>\n  Salary: $90,000-$110,000 </p><pre>\n </pre><p></p>",
