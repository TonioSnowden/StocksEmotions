  "text": "<p>The San Francisco-based company reported revenue of $7.41 billion, up from $5.96 billion in the year-ago quarter and above the estimates by the company and analysts. While inflation and economic concerns have made some consumers and companies more cautious about spending, Salesforce said demand for its software has remained strong as businesses looked for ways to boost efficiency and sales.</p><p>\"Our customers are still investing in digital technology,\" Salesforce co-Chief Executive Bret Taylor said in an interview.</p><p>The cloud-based business services provider and its competitors saw sales jump during the pandemic as workers around the world set up home offices and employers expanded their use of digital tools. At Salesforce, revenue soared more than 50% from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2022.</p><p>Salesforce's share price rose quickly along with its sales, leaping more than 50% in calendar years 2020 and 2021. It has since given up a lot of that ground, falling 37% from the end of last year through Tuesday's close.</p><p>The company's sales outlook for the current quarter fell below Wall Street estimates. Salesforce sees second-quarter revenue coming in between $7.69 billion and $7.7 billion; the average analyst estimate on FactSet was for $7.77 billion.</p><p>Salesforce raised its profit guidance and lowered its sales outlook for the year. It said it expects its full-year adjusted earnings will be between $4.74 and $4.76 a share, up from the $4.62 to $4.64 range it had expected in March.</p>",
