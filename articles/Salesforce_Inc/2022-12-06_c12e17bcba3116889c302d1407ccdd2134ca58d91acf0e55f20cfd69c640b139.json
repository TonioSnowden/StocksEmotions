  "title": "Okta and Atlassian added to 'zombie' stocks list by equity research firm New Constructs; The software companies are facing significant cash burn, firm says",
  "text": "<p>\"Companies with fast-depleting cash reserves are risky investments in any market,\" wrote New Constructs CEO David Trainer in a recent note, adding that rising interest rates and a slowing economy are adding fuel to the fire. \"As these companies struggle to grow revenue, they will face margin pressures and serious challenges to raising more capital to fund their cash burn,\" he added.</p><p>In the note, which was released before Okta's third-quarter results last week, New Constructs warned that cash burn is an issue for the identity software company. \"No matter how you analyze Okta's business, one thing is clear: the company burns through a large amount of cash,\" Trainer wrote. \"Since fiscal 2018, the company has burned $3.8 billion in FCF [free cash flow] excluding acquisitions.\"</p><p>Now read: Okta stock surges more than 25% as analysts approve of company's profit heading</p><p>Okta has endured a turbulent year marked by salesforce difficulties and a hack dubbed \"Oktapus.\" But on Nov. 30, the software maker reported strong third-quarter results and forecast profitability for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2024, sending its stock surging. Okta ended the following day's session up 26.5%.</p><p>Okta's stock has fallen 73.4% in 2022, compared with the S&amp;P 500's SPX drop of 17.3%. The company's stock hit a 52-week low of $44.12 on Nov. 4. Of 33 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 20 have an overweight or buy rating, 11 have a hold rating, and two have a sell rating for Okta.</p><p>Business-collaboration software company Atlassian was also added to New Constructs' list of \"zombie\" stocks recently. \"With only $1.8 billion of cash on the books as of September 30, 2022, Atlassian can only sustain its TTM [trailing 12-month] burn rate for another 23 months from the end of October 2022,\" Trainer wrote in a separate note. \"In other words, Atlassian will need either a capital raise or a significant change in business operations to remain a going concern.\"</p><p>On Nov. 4, Atlassian's stock suffered its worst day ever, weighed down by an earnings and revenue outlook that fell short of Wall Street expectations and wiping nearly $13 billion off the software company's valuation. Atlassian hit a 52-week low of $113.86 on Nov. 21.</p><p>Now read: Atlassian stock suffers worst day ever, nearly $13 billion in valuation wiped away</p><p>Atlassian, which makes software programs such as Jira, has seen its stock fall 67.2% in 2022.</p><p>But Atlassian notes that it is generating positive free cash flow quarter-over-quarter. The company ended its recent fiscal first quarter with more than 249,000 customers and almost $76 million in free cash flow, up from $58.1 million in the prior year's quarter, according to a letter to shareholders last month. \"We experience seasonality in our free cash flow results, with Q1 typically having the lowest free cash flow due to the timing of employee bonus payments,\" the company said in the letter.</p><p>Atlassian also noted that its gross margin will decrease modestly in fiscal year 2023 \"due to the continued business mix shift to the cloud and investments we are making to support cloud migrations.\" Operating margin will be in a mid-teens percentage, the company said, consistent with its previously issued target, despite macroeconomic headwinds and adjustments to the company's revenue target.</p><p>\"Free cash flow is expected to be impacted, on a comparative basis, due to the lower operating margin in FY23 versus FY22,\" Atlassian added, in the letter. \"Additionally, free cash flow may be impacted as a result of the continued business mix shift to the Cloud.\"</p><p>Related: Rivian: 'Zombie' company or charging down a path to EV success?</p><p>The company also explained that maintenance contracts for its Server products and subscription contracts for its Data Center products are offered only on annual terms, while subscription contracts for its Cloud products are offered on both annual and monthly terms. \"In the short term, the shift to the Cloud and the potential mix change in billing terms may create a headwind for free cash flow,\" Atlassian said, in the letter. \"Over the long term, as more enterprise customers migrate to the Cloud, we expect any such headwind to subside.\"</p><p>Of 25 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 17 have an overweight or buy rating and eight have a hold rating for Atlassian.</p><p>Other companies on New Constructs' \"zombie\" stocks list include Affirm Holdings Inc. AFRM, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC, GameStop Corp. GME, Snap Inc. SNAP , Rivian Automotive Inc. RIVN and Carvana Co. CVNA.</p><p>Okta and Atlassian added to 'zombie' stocks list by equity research firm New Constructs</p>",
