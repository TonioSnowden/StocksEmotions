  "title": "Stock Futures, Oil Rise, Pointing to More Seesaw Moves on Omicron Uncertainty; Investors struggle to assess implications of coronavirus variant on business and economies",
  "text": "<p>The uncertainty has led to seesaw moves in global markets that extended into Wednesday. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, signaling gains for the benchmark index. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.9% Tuesday, closing out a decline for November after a late-month dive sparked by the emergence of Omicron.</p><p>\"We just don't know how much more infectious it is, how severe the symptoms are and what the impact of that is,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. \"What I'd assume now is this probably isn't enough to derail the recovery that's going on.\"</p><p>Invesco's multiasset funds have bought stocks at cheaper levels since Omicron first rattled markets last week, Mr. Mackay added.</p><p>Stocks tied to the travel industry, including cruise operator Carnival and real-estate investment trust Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, rose. Vaccine-maker Moderna pared some recent gains, slipping 3%. Salesforce.com lost 6.5% after the software company's guidance for fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations.</p><p>Brent oil prices, which have tumbled on signs Omicron could curtail demand for jet fuel, rose 2.9% to $71.25 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets Wednesday and Thursday to determine its response to recent price declines.</p><p>Analysts say the cartel, still holding back production in tandem with allies led by Russia, may pause plans to pump more oil in January, or further cut output. Goldman Sachs analysts said recent price declines suggest traders are preparing for daily global oil demand to fall by more than 7% over the next three months.</p><p>Another cause for concern, stock investors say, is that the rapid pace of inflation could prevent the Fed and other central banks from unleashing stimulus in the event of severe disruption caused by Omicron. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell added to those worries Tuesday when he opened the door to an interest-rate risein the first half of 2022.</p><p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday it expects consumer-price inflation in the U.S. to average 4.4% in 2022, up from the 3.1% forecast in September. However, the research body's chief economist said the world could experience price declines if the new variant sidesteps existing vaccines.</p><p>Investors will also parse the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index at 10 a.m. ET. Economists expect the survey to show factories experienced another month of strong new orders in November, but also rising prices and long waiting times for materials.</p><p>Wednesday's move back into riskier assets knocked the government bond market. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.471% from 1.440% Tuesday. Yields move inversely to bond prices.</p><p>Overseas markets gained. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.2%, led higher by shares of travel, leisure and basic-resource companies, which would all be exposed to an economic downturn. Strong performers included budget airline Wizz Air, up 8.8%, Deutsche Lufthansa, up 6.7%, and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, which gained 6.2%.</p><p>Winners from the stay-at-home trade fell. German food-delivery firm HelloFresh lost 5.1% and U.K.-listed takeout company Deliveroo shed 3.1%.</p><p>Asian markets were broadly higher. South Korea's Kospi added 2.1% while Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures, Oil Rise, Pointing to More Seesaw Moves on Omicron Uncertainty</p>",
