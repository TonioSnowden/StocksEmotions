EY's dominance of tech audits is “both a blessing and a curse”, said Di Sibio. </p> <p>While the firm's auditors generate big fees from the work, its consultants pay a price. Not only can they not work for these tech giants because of auditor independence rules, they are also restricted from forming alliances to work alongside them.</p> <p>Consultants increasingly make money by winning lucrative contracts to work side by side with the likes of Amazon and Google to help clients move their systems on to the cloud. </p> <p>A separation would also benefit the audit business, according to Di Sibio. The auditors would be free to work for clients of their former consulting colleagues. They could also boost growth by rebuilding an advisory arm of their own, he said. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see whether any of the other Big Four firms will be tempted to follow suit. So far they have stood by their model of combining audit and advisory business lines. </p> <p><strong>PwC</strong> boss <strong>Bob Moritz</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8eaa2a28-9b76-477a-9999-a837b2934d44\"> told the FT</a> this week that keeping the two businesses under one roof is crucial to attracting staff and this outweighs the difficulty of managing the conflict of interest risk between them.</p> <p>Di Sibio is making a different bet. He will have to convince his fellow EY executives at a crunch meeting in New York this week to go ahead with the plan before votes among all 13,000 EY partners later this year. </p> <p>Only then will he be able to secure his legacy as more than a caretaker.</p> <h1>Sequoia's Chinese money tree faces its biggest test</h1> <p>After a dismal year for Chinese tech companies, the $9bn that<strong> Sequoia China</strong> raised earlier this month to fund hundreds more start-ups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d288c2f-215a-4661-aa1a-273671b945cd\">was a display of star power</a> from the venture capital group's billionaire founder <strong>Neil Shen</strong>.</p> <p>Shen, who launched the Chinese arm of Silicon Valley venture capital giant <strong>Sequoia Capital </strong>in 2005, has become known as China's most successful investor thanks to his early investments in <strong>ByteDance</strong>, <strong>Alibaba </strong>and <strong>Meituan</strong>, which grew to be China's biggest tech companies.</p> <p>But in the past 12 months the regulatory environment has shifted. </p> <p>The Chinese government has cracked down on its tech giants over everything from monopolistic practices to data security, bringing to a juddering halt a golden age for the country's internet start-ups — the sweet spot upon which Shen has built his $50bn firm.</p> <p>The regulatory attack forced some global investors to put their China investments on hold and some even said the country had become uninvestable. Others, which have spent years increasing their allocations to China and growing local teams, are loath to reduce allocation to an economy that has consistently outperformed in their portfolios. They're desperate to find opportunities in this new environment.</p> <p>Some of that capital has fled to safer funds with proven track records, and Shen looks to be the biggest beneficiary. </p> <p>The question of whether he can repeat his 17-year record when keeping up with political currents is more important than ever, and Xi Jinping's “common prosperity” campaign looks on with unease at big pots of private capital.</p> <h1>JPMorgan's new push to please the buyout barons</h1> <p><strong>Jimmy Lee</strong>, the top dealmaker at <strong>JPMorgan</strong> <strong>Chase</strong> before his death in 2015, was known as the banker to call to get a leveraged buyout over the line. But even Lee would have struggled in today's frozen leveraged finance market. </p> <p>Lenders such as JPMorgan have sharply pulled back credit commitments as they nurse heavy losses on unsold buyout loans. Meanwhile, direct lenders including <strong>Sixth</strong> <strong>Street</strong> and <strong>Blue Owl</strong> continue to steal market share. </p> <p>The conditions have frustrated JPMorgan enough that it has created an internal direct lender to turn the tables on the competition.</p> <p>The US banking giant has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd51f791-2841-4ef9-9c73-0f5465926422\">set up a unit to compete with direct lenders</a>, <strong>Kevin</strong> <strong>Foley</strong>, JPMorgan's head of global debt capital markets, told the FT's Joshua Franklin.</p> <p>The unit, created in 2021, has already completed around 20 deals, with loans ranging from $50mn to roughly $500mn. Demand from clients has long been there.</p> <p>“We were always catching this fish, it was just that we were throwing it back — now we want to hold on to it,” he said. JPMorgan will use its own balance sheet capital to fund the loans.</p> <p>The manoeuvre is an early signal of how megabanks will realign their leveraged lending operations to win back favour from clients. Still unclear is whether the strategy will be able to compete against less-regulated non-bank lenders. </p> <p>JPMorgan is hamstrung by leveraged lending guidelines that recommend banks do not lend beyond a ratio of debt to earnings that exceeds six times. Another issue: the costly capital charges of owning low-rated debts.</p> <p>JPMorgan's push comes at a time when the broadly syndicated financing market has gone from red hot to ice cold as banks mark down loans they have struggled to sell. In the second quarter, large lenders took over $1bn in charges against unsold leveraged loans.</p> <p>JPMorgan does not plan to move unsold loans to this new hold-to-maturity unit.</p> <p>Debts may not shift around internally, but the new structure underscores how firms designed to move assets also want the ability to store them, Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09c7082e-4d6d-49f2-bb32-8b1051ed07b1\">notes</a>.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>The Vistria Group</strong> has appointed <strong>Margaret Anadu </strong>as senior partner.
