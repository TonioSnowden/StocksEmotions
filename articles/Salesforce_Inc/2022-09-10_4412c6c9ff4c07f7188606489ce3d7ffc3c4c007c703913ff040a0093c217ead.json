  "title": "In Speaker Bid, McCarthy  Walks Precarious Path  ---  Congressman makes alliances, takes few policy stands  ----  By Natalie Andrews",
  "text": "<p>   Kevin McCarthy is closer than ever to becoming Speaker of the House, a job he has wanted for years. The path he's taken is a risky one. </p><p>   In his second bid to lead the House, the California Republican has tied his fortunes closely to former President Donald Trump. He has allowed wide latitude to the most outspoken conservatives in his caucus, while largely avoiding being overly identified with any particular policies or ideological wing of the party. </p><p>   That has so far allowed him to maintain broad support in a GOP increasingly populated by energetic and unruly pro-Trump lawmakers, according to lawmakers and current and former congressional aides. </p><p>   Many nonpartisan analysts and most polls suggest that Republicans will win control of the House, though some recent polls have shown Democrats' fortunes improving. </p><p>   If Republicans take control, Mr. McCarthy's high-wire act will be tested. The members on his right flank have a list of demands and will be watching to make sure he doesn't try to hold them back or compromise too much with Democrats. Similar pressures hampered his two predecessors as GOP leader, Paul Ryan and John Boehner. </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy has started having conversations with lawmakers to head off future opposition. Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, who is running to be the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, said holding such discussions is easy but wrangling votes is hard, because, \"It's difficult to get where 218 are on the same page\" on policy. </p><p>   Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.), who is retiring, said Mr. McCarthy has appeased the far-right flank at the risk of losing centrist Republicans. He used to call Mr. McCarthy a friend, but they broke decisively over the GOP leader's approach to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. </p><p>   \"He would come to us, 'Oh I've got to do this so I can control the crazies,'\" Mr. Kinzinger said. \"He'll be the worst speaker and he won't last because he's going to be led around by insurrectionists.\" </p><p>   Cutting bipartisan deals is part of the speaker's job, particularly when the opposite party controls the White House and possibly the Senate. Unlike Messrs. Ryan and Boehner, both former committee chairmen, Mr. McCarthy has little record of that kind of work. Nor does he have much history as a legislator, with no signature issues or big policy achievements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has largely kept him out of big negotiations in the Democratic-controlled Congress. </p><p>   The most common words that colleagues past and present used to describe Mr. McCarthy are congenial and jovial. They also call him \"not policy driven,\" and a \"shape shifter,\" a reference to how he has made friends with the broad swath of the caucus -- and that he has never been known as an outspoken conservative or centrist. </p><p>   \"Unlike say, a Newt, or maybe even me, where you want to be the lead policy maker, he looks at this more as a lead coaching role,\" said Mr. Ryan, referring to former Speaker Newt Gingrich. </p><p>   Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.), a Trump ally who has improbably suggested the former president should be speaker, assessed Mr. McCarthy more sharply. \"Kevin is not bridled by too many policy views,\" he said. \"His organizing principle is ambition.\" </p><p>   Mike Sommers, a former top aide to Mr. Boehner who now runs the American Petroleum Institute, made the case that Mr. McCarthy is well-suited to this moment. \"He's going to have to be leader of the opposition while at the same time figuring out how to govern,\" he said. \"In divided government, political skill is more important than policy skill because he will have to convince people that it's in their political interest to vote for something.\" </p><p>   GOP lawmakers say that if Republicans don't win they could upend their entire leadership team. If Republicans do win, a slim majority powered by newly elected Trump allies could make it harder for Mr. McCarthy to wrangle enough votes on the House floor to secure -- and keep -- the job. </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy rose through the GOP ranks as a largely political animal, with an encyclopedic knowledge of districts around the country and a tireless appetite for raising money and campaigning. He is well-liked by most colleagues but not feared. Whether he is respected enough to keep his colleagues' backing will depend on the size of majority Republicans win in November. </p><p>   \"I have a couple of different philosophies,\" Mr. McCarthy said in an interview. \"I'm continuing learning every day, I can never have too many friends in this world, and I never give up.\" </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy, a 57-year-old native of Bakersfield, Calif., has been in leadership since 2009, his second term. His first speakership bid, to succeed Mr. Boehner, failed in 2015 after he made what was widely seen as a gaffe in a television interview about House Republicans' Benghazi investigation, when he said the probe was an effort to tank Hillary Clinton's poll numbers. </p><p>   Mr. Ryan took the top job instead, holding it until the GOP lost the majority in 2018. Mr. McCarthy has been House minority leader since 2019 and is, at the moment, unopposed in his second bid for speaker. </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy has created task forces to identify a platform for the new Congress, which he and House Republicans expect to announce in September as a \"Commitment to America.\" It is an echo of Mr. Gingrich's \"Contract with America,\" which Republicans used in 1994 to campaign to win the House majority. </p><p>   In giving a preview of the commitment, Mr. McCarthy jumped from topic to topic. \"Energy independence, so that helps with inflation, and then what you want to be able to do is secure our streets, making them safe. We're not going to defund the police, we're going to fund the police,\" he said. Republicans also want to improve border security and allow parents to have more say in their children's education. </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy has no relationship with President Biden and on Jan. 6, 2021, joined the majority of House Republicans to vote against certifying the election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania. He will lead a conference that wants to cut government spending, with members who want to use government-funding bills to repeal the Democrats' climate-and-tax bill that passed in August. </p><p>   Such proposals would face steep obstacles, at least as long as a Democrat is in the White House. Most legislation the House passes with a simple majority could also hit a wall in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes. </p><p>   And Mr. McCarthy, for the first time, would have to play a leading role in ensuring the federal government stays open and is able to pay its bills. Mr. Ryan ended his tenure by partially shutting down the government, unable to reach an agreement. Mr. Boehner had a tumultuous six-year tenure marked by repeated intraparty fiscal clashes. </p><p>   Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the task forces that Mr. McCarthy has assembled \"aren't laying out a vision\" and he wants to see his party willing to shut down the government to remove funds for policies that Republicans don't support. </p><p>   \"I've never once seen us lose political strength with a shutdown fight,\" he said, saying they should \"put forth a spending bill as the House of Representatives and make the Senate eat it.\" </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy has been holding conversations with lawmakers on how to change the appropriations process to get Republicans on board with backing spending bills and how to tackle issues such as raising the debt ceiling. He said he has been studying the problems that befell past GOP majorities and taken the lesson that \"we didn't talk about the tough things ahead of time.\" </p><p>   Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group that encompasses about 75% of the GOP conference, said its members \"all want to defund additional IRS agents and rein in spending. The real test of leadership will be getting those done without shutting down the government but that's where the leverage is.\" </p><p>   Hard-line Republicans want Mr. McCarthy to reinstate the ability of any lawmaker to propose a vote on removing the speaker, a tool Democrats eliminated from House rules when they took power in 2019. The threat of such a vote helped contribute to Mr. Boehner's resignation in 2015. </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy will face pressure to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of border policy and Attorney General Merrick Garland, who some Republicans say has abused his office. Mr. McCarthy said they were both worthy of investigation and said that should be done before he would back impeachment. </p><p>   He will also need to decide what other investigations to pursue -- and how far to push them -- on topics ranging from the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the president's son, to the Justice Department's investigations of Mr. Trump and the Biden administration's coronavirus response. He would also like to launch a committee to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy has pledged to give committee positions to Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green (Ga.) and Paul Gosar (Ariz.), whom Democrats removed over comments pushing conspiracy theories. In retaliation, he plans to remove some Democrats including Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Eric Swalwell (Calif.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) from their current committee positions. </p><p>   Mr. McCarthy's leadership philosophy stems from what he learned in business school -- he earned a bachelor's in marketing and a masters in business administration from California State University, Bakersfield -- and from talking to corporate executives. He often mentions Tesla Inc. and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk as a personal friend and recently brought him to Jackson Hole to speak to GOP donors. He speaks with leaders of companies such as Salesforce Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., which shapes his policy focus. </p><p>   Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called Mr. McCarthy a friend and said the two talk mostly about trees -- Mr. Benioff's project to plant, conserve or restore one trillion trees, and Mr. McCarthy's efforts to preserve the giant Sequoias in Southern California. </p><p></p>",
