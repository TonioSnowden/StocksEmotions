  "title": "Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor leaving, stock falls after lower-than-expected forecast; Cloud-software stalwart projects fourth-quarter sales $900 million lower than Street expectations, shares decline 6% in after-hours trading",
  "text": "<p>The cloud-software company said in a news release that founder, co-CEO and Chairman Marc Benioff will resume the sole CEO role on Jan. 31.</p><p>\"I am grateful for six fantastic years at Salesforce,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"Marc was my mentor well before I joined Salesforce and the opportunity to partner with him to lead the most important software company in the world is career-defining. After a lot of reflection, I've decided to return to my entrepreneurial roots.\"</p><p>Salesforce reported that third-quarter net income fell to $210 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $468 million, or 47 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for stock-based compensation and other costs, earnings were $1.40 a share. Revenue rose to $7.84 billion from $6.86 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Analysts, who have been expressing concerns about a slowdown in business-software spending, had forecast adjusted earnings of $1.22 a share on revenue of $7.83 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>\"We remain positive on the long-term outlook for Salesforce as front office applications leader,\" Michael Turits, analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets, wrote ahead of the company's earnings report. \"That said, we remain cautious regarding the near-term outlook given ongoing recession concerns, slowing cloud spend, and weaker conversations we had with a few Salesforce channels this quarter.\"</p><p>Concerns sprung from the forecast, as Salesforce executives' guidance fell short of expectations. They expect fourth-quarter earnings of 23 cents to 25 cents a share on revenue in the range of $7.932 billion to $8.032 billion, and adjusted earnings of $1.35 to $1.37 a share. Analysts had forecast adjusted earnings of $1.44 a share on revenue of $8.94 billion.</p><p>Shares of Salesforce have declined about 37% this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, whose 30 components include Salesforce, has fallen about 5% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX is down almost 15% this year.</p><p>Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor leaving, stock falls after lower-than-expected forecast</p>",
