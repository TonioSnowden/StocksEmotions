  "title": "Republican National Committee Files Suit Against House Jan. 6 Committee; Lawsuit seeks to block a subpoena the Democratic-led panel issued to Salesforce seeking records linked to GOP activities",
  "text": "<p>The RNC lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleges that the subpoena violates the committee's constitutional rights and is overly broad. The RNC further argues that the committee itself was invalidly formed and lacks the authority to demand such records. The RNC's lawsuit also named House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as a defendant along with the Jan. 6 committee and all its individual members.</p><p>\"The Salesforce Subpoena demands production of sensitive and proprietary data over more than a two-month period, which would give the Select Committee unprecedented access to the RNC's internal political strategies and to private, personal information regarding its supporters,\" the committee wrote in its lawsuit.</p><p>Salesforce didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The House panel has asked for detailed information about Republican donor engagement through fundraising emails and online polls around the time of the Jan. 6 attack. Though it wasn't seeking records on individual donors, the RNC said some of the records might contain private donor information. The panel also asked for records related to the RNC staff's use of the Salesforce platform on or around Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>\"The Select Committee issued a subpoena to an email fundraising vendor in order to help investigators understand the impact of false, inflammatory messages in the weeks before January 6th, the flow of funds, and whether contributions were actually directed to the purpose indicated,\"' said Tim Mulvey, a spokesman for the committee. \"This action has absolutely nothing to do with getting the private information of voters or donors.\"</p><p>The lawsuit is one of more than two dozen attempts in courts across the country to resist the panel's subpoenas. Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser to Mr. Trump, also brought suit separately this week to stop a mobile-phone service provider from turning over his phone records to the panel. Mr. Miller, 36, is on a family plan with his parents, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>The federal appeals court in Washington has ruled that the panel had a legislative purpose in a lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump to stop the Biden administration from turning over some of his presidential papersâ€”a decision the Supreme Court let stand in January.</p><p>The questions about the protection of the RNC's political speech and donor privacy that the RNC has raised in its lawsuit, however, haven't yet been considered by courts in other Jan. 6 litigation.</p><p>Last week the committee said in a court filing that Mr. Trump and some of his allies might have committed crimes by seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com</p><p>Republican National Committee Files Suit Against House Jan. 6 Committee</p>",
