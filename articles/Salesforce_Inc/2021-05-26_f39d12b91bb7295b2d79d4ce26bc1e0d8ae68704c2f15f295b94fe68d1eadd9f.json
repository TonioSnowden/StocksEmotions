  "text": "<p>Snowflake SNOW reported a first-quarter loss of $203.2 million, or 70 cents a share, more than doubling the loss of $93.6 million from a year ago. Sales also more than doubled, coming in at $228.9 million after reporting sales of $109 million a year ago. Snowflake does not provide adjusted per-share earnings information.</p><p>Analysts on average expected losses of 51 cents a share on sales of $212.7 million, according to FactSet. Shares declined more than 6% in after-hours trading following the release of the results, after closing with a 2.3% gain at $235.24.</p><p>Snowflake, which makes cloud-based database software, went public in September 2020 and became the largest company by market value to double in its first day of trading after an initial public offering . Investments by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B and Salesforce.com Inc. CRM validated Snowflake's cloud-based approach to competing with database-software giant Oracle Corp. ORCL</p><p>For more: Five things to know about Snowflake </p><p>Snowflake is still trading at roughly double its $120 IPO price, but has not stayed at the lofty heights shares found late last year. Shares have declined more than 7% from their price on the end of the first day of trading, and are more than 60% lower than their peak closing price of $390, set on Dec. 8.</p><p>Cannacord Genuity software analysts did not expect Wednesday's report to have much of an effect on the stock, which has been caught up in volatility that seems to affect much of the high-multiple, momentum stocks in the technology sector.</p><p>“Our view for now is that Snowflake — as with most high-growth, high-multiple stocks — is more likely to trade in concert with macro news flow than on company-specific data (expectations are high, as investors suspect that Snowflake will meet them),” the analysts, who have a hold rating and $275 price target on the stock, wrote this week. “In other words, if inflation and interest rate fears continueto control the macroeconomic narrative, high-growth stocks with long-term payoffs, like Snowflake, will take the brunt of the impact.”</p>",
