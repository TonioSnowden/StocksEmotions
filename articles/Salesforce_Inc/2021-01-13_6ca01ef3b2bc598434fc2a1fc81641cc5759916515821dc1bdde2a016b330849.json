  "text": "<p>Typically cancer blood-testing companies have sought to identify markers of cancer such as mutations in the DNA tumors shed into the blood. Delfi says its approach looks instead for a more-abundant signal of the disease that requires relatively little sequencing to detect.</p><p>Delfi says its tests will be based on \"fragmentomes,\" which represent the aberrant packaging of DNA in cancer cells. Cancer cells divide so rapidly that they can't properly organize themselves before dividing again, Delfi Chief Scientific Officer Nicholas Dracopoli said.</p><p>Delfi founder and Chief Executive Victor Velculescu said it is too soon to project what its tests will cost, but he said he aims to make them affordable enough to be used widely in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Cash infusion.

With many corporate offices closed because of the pandemic, many young professionals have left cities like New York and San Francisco for warmer, cheaper places. A number still plan to return after their offices reopen, leaving them reluctant to buy homes or sign long-term apartment leases.
