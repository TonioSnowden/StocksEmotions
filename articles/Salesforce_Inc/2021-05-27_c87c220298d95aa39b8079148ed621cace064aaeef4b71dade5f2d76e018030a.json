  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Salesforce CEO, Others  Boost Timber-Carbon Bets  ----  By Ryan Dezember",
  "text": "<p>    Salesforce.com Inc. Chief Executive Marc Benioff and other big investors are beefing up their stakes in a firm that matches companies wanting to offset emissions with timber owners willing to defer harvests for a fee. </p><p>   The firm, SilviaTerra, will change its name to NCX, after its Natural Capital Exchange carbon market, and add Mr. Benioff to its board as part of a $20 million funding pact led by the software executive. Other investors include Union Square Ventures, Version One Ventures and Microsoft Corp.'s Climate Innovation Fund. </p><p>   The deal is the latest in the booming business of paying forest owners not to cut down trees but instead lease standing timber as carbon sponges to companies that aim to eventually operate without adding carbon to the atmosphere. Last year, oil giant BP PLC bought a controlling stake in Finite Carbon, an NCX rival. </p><p>   \"This isn't philanthropy,\" Mr. Benioff said in an interview. \"This is an actual use of capitalism to create greater sustainability.\" </p><p>   Mr. Benioff said his personal venture firm has done well wagering about $1 billion on technology companies, but that it recently decided to invest aggressively in sustainability businesses. NCX is his firm's first such wager, he said, on the belief that big companies will face increasing pressure from investors, customers and regulators to offset emissions that they cannot eliminate. </p><p>   \"They're being held accountable,\" Mr. Benioff said. \"They need to sequester emissions.\" </p><p>   Forest-offset markets took root eight years ago in California's cap-and-trade system, which aims to reduce greenhouse gasses by making it more expensive over time for firms operating in the state to pollute. But offset projects that pass muster with California regulators require expensive forest surveys and commitments from landowners not to cut for more than 100 years -- economical only for owners of very large tracts. </p><p>   Demand for offsets to appease inventors and customers -- but not regulators -- has spawned so-called voluntary forest-carbon markets with shorter terms and lower upfront costs. </p><p>   Mr. Benioff, Union Square, Version One and others seeded what was then known as SilviaTerra with $4.4 million. The cash helped it launch last month a market in which companies have agreed to pay Southern pine growers to defer harvests of more than a million acres of mill-bound pine trees until next year. </p><p>   The offer -- $17 an offset -- caught the attention of Southern timber growers. </p><p>   A surfeit of mature pine has crushed log prices in the region despite soaring prices for finished wood products, like lumber and pulp. Landowners ranging from Molpus Woodlands Group LLC, a big timberland investment management organization that enrolled 468,000 acres, to individuals with fewer than 150 acres are accepting cash to not cut. </p><p>   Mark Dale, a Monticello, Miss., forestry consultant, said 12 clients of his Forest Pro LLC sold offsets in April and that others with even more acreage are considering doing so this time around. </p><p>   Weak pulpwood prices convinced some to sell offsets and wait for the market to improve for the skinny, knotty and overgrown pines that are mashed into paper and cardboard, he said. </p><p>   \"It's only one year,\" Mr. Dale said. \"You're growing a 30-year crop.\" </p><p>   Microsoft, which bought more than $3 million worth of the resulting offsets, helped NCX map U.S. forest data, such as tree species and wood volume, using satellite imagery and computers. </p><p>   The satellite pictures and some in-person tree measuring are used to determine whether trees have value if they were felled and how much carbon they will soak up over the ensuing 12 months if left to grow. </p><p>   Qualifying timber must be merchantable, which is the market maker's effort to ensure that offsets aren't produced with trees that wouldn't otherwise be cut. </p><p>   Landowners are paid after a year if satellite imagery confirms the trees are still standing. They will then have the option to re-enroll or harvest timber. </p><p>   The new investment is funding NCX's expansion beyond the pine belt, said CEO Zack Parisa. NCX is accepting bids from landowners around the Great Lakes and hardwood forest owners in the Southeast as well as pine growers for the next round of no-cut contracts, which will take effect July 1. </p><p>   The firm expects to offer landowners in all 48 contiguous states the ability to sell offsets by autumn. </p><p>   \"We've seen massive uptake from landowners,\" Mr. Parisa said. \"The intention for NCX is to be a global market.\" </p><p></p>",
