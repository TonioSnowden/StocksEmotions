  "title": "Judge Rejects Republican National Committee's Suit Against Jan. 6 Panel; Ruling allows Democratic-led committee to obtain records linked to GOP fundraising efforts held by vendor Salesforce; the RNC will appeal",
  "text": "<p>The decision represented a victory for the Jan. 6 committee that could bolster the panel in other lawsuits across the country attempting to resist its subpoenas.</p><p>The panel, made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, said it has conducted more than 800 interviews and depositions and obtained nearly 90,000 documents as of early April. But it still trying to gather information about the causes and circumstances surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump.</p><p>Judge Kelly, an appointee of Mr. Trump, issued an injunction temporarily blocking the data from being turned over to the Jan. 6 committee until May 5 to give the RNC a chance to appeal his ruling.</p><p>The Jan. 6 panel had subpoenaed records related to the RNC's fundraising and digital efforts from Salesforce, a commercial marketing platform that the party used to manage communications with donors.</p><p>Matt Raymer, chief counsel for the RNC, said that the organization would appeal and that the subpoena had been narrowed after negotiations between the select committee and Salesforce.</p><p>\"Nancy Pelosi's attempted seizure of her political opponents' campaign strategy cannot be allowed to stand, and we appreciate Judge Kelly continuing to temporarily block the subpoena,\" Mr. Raymer said.</p><p>Salesforce didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The House committee said it issued the subpoena to help investigators understand the impact of what the panel called false and inflammatory statements about the 2020 election results. The panel said it wasn't seeking records on individual voters or donors.</p><p>The RNC's lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleged that the subpoena was overly broad and would give the Jan. 6 committee access to sensitive information about donors and the party's digital strategies.</p><p>Judge Kelly rejected several arguments made by the RNC, including that the subpoena violated its First Amendment rights by compelling the disclosure of confidential internal strategies, and that the panel's demands were unduly burdensome. He also rejected the RNC's claims that the Jan. 6 committee itself was invalidly formed and that the panel's subpoena lacked a valid legislative purpose.</p><p>\"Obviously, information that shows which email campaigns attracted more attention, and which attracted less, has some strategic value,\" Judge Kelly wrote. \"But on the record here, whatever competitive harm may come to the RNC from disclosure of the actual material at issue is too 'logically attenuated' and 'speculative' to defeat the Select Committee's weighty interest.\"</p><p>The Jan. 6 panel \"seeks reasonably relevant information from a narrow window during which the RNC sent emails promoting claims that the presidential election was fraudulent or stolen,\" Judge Kelly said.</p><p>Separately, the select committee said on Monday that it has asked three more House members to cooperate voluntarily with the probe: Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Ronny Jackson of Texas, all close supporters of Mr. Trump.</p><p>The select committee said that the GOP members have information relevant to the facts, circumstances and causes of the Capitol attack, said Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D., Miss) and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.).</p><p>The committee had previously asked Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) to testify, but he rejected the request. The committee hasn't said if it would subpoena lawmakers to testify.</p><p>In the committee's letter to Mr. Biggs, Mr. Thompson and Ms. Cheney write that they want to ask him about communications between him and then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about efforts to persuade state legislators and officials that the 2020 election was stolen and seek their help in overturning the election in favor of Mr. Trump.</p><p>The committee's letter also says that \"recent information from former White House personnel\" has revealed an effort by some House Republicans after Jan. 6 \"to seek a presidential pardon for activities taken in connection with President Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\"</p><p>The letter says Mr. Biggs's name was identified as a potential participant in the pardon effort. \"We would like to understand all the details of the request for a pardon, more specific reasons why a pardon was sought, and the scope of the proposed pardon,\" the letter says.</p><p>The lawmakers didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Write to Alexa Corse at alexa.corse@wsj.com and Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com</p><p>Judge Rejects Republican National Committee's Suit Against Jan. 6 Panel</p>",
