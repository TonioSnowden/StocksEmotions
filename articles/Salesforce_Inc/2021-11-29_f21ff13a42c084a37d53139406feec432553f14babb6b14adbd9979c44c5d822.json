  "title": "Cyber Monday Sales Are Expected to Stall; Online retailers offered fewer discounts due to limited inventory, while more shoppers returned to stores",
  "text": "<p>U.S. online sales were up slightly during the early hours of Cyber Monday, although analysts expect digital sales to be flat for the day as smaller discounts gave shoppers less incentive to spend.</p><p>Shoppers spent $4 billion online through noon eastern time in the U.S., up 8% from the same period last year, according to shopping data compiled by Salesforce.com Inc. The cloud software company projected sales of $11 billion for the day, which would put total Cyber Monday sales even with 2020.</p><p>The early figures are in line with online retail sales for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, which failed to surpass the previous year's sales for the first time in years, according to some industry estimates. Overall, U.S. retail sales rose 14% during the Thanksgiving weekend compared with last year, and 5.8% from 2019, according to data released by Mastercard SpendingPulse.</p><p>U.S. shoppers have been eager to return to stores, with many big-box retailers, discount chains and department stores seeing foot traffic surge on Black Friday. Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses mobile-device location data to measure foot traffic, said foot traffic at indoors malls rose 83.5% from 2020, although the surge of in-person shopping wasn't enough to surpass pre-pandemic levels. </p><p>Manhattan's Fifth Avenue on Black Friday, when many retailers reported a surge in foot traffic.

The World Health Organization said Friday that the Omicron coronavirus strain is a global \"variant of concern,\" and U.S. health officials say it is likely already in the country.</p><p>Online discounts were also smaller on Monday compared with last year, but were larger than the promotions offered during the holiday weekend, Salesforce reported. The average Cyber Monday discount was 28% as of noon, 7% lower than 2020, Salesforce said. Supply-chain disruptions have made it difficult for some retailers to keep their shelves stocked, spurring consumers to begin their holiday shopping early.</p><p>\"It's been less about Cyber Week and more about Cyber November,\" said Rob Garf, vice president and general manager of retail at Salesforce. \"It's always a retailer's dream to pull demand early in the fall, and with supply-chain bottlenecks and fears of inflation, consumers did shop early and often.\"</p><p>Sixty-one percent of shoppers surveyed by the National Retail Federation, a trade group, said they had started their holiday shopping before Thanksgiving, up from 51% a decade ago.</p><p>Some shoppers are searching for items so scarce, they couldn't wait for Black Friday to go shopping in stores.</p><p>Logun Keller, 39 years old, purchased a Sony PlayStation 5 online last week after looking for six months. Mr. Keller, of Sacramento, Calif., who purchased his console from Amazon.com after many false starts, said that most retailers aren't prepared to deal with bots and the scalpers that use them to buy and flip popular videogame systems but that shopping online does have its advantages.</p><p>\"Having access to multiple companies at once and not relying on driving to brick-and-mortar stores is a big improvement,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Charity L.
