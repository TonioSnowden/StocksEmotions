  "text": "<p>This form of online layaway purchases has proved popular in Europe and recently found acceptance in the U.S. for everything from Peloton equipment to household appliances.</p><p>\"Buy now, pay later\" offers a new spin on the concept of layaway, which has become increasingly popular among younger, cash-strapped consumers.</p><p>It allows consumers to split purchases into installments and charging them either simple interest or no interest at all, in a break from the traditional credit model that lets interest compound.</p><p>Unlike with traditional layaway, however, consumers receive instant access to their purchase as they pay it off.</p><p>Furniture companies, for instance, have long allowed people to pay for big-ticket items in installments while taking the product home right away, but now the concept has made its way online, spreading across industries and into smaller purchase amounts.</p><p>An increasing number of younger people and those living paycheck to paycheck are relying on BNPL, and other alternative forms of payment, experts say.</p><p>About half of younger people — millennials and Generation Z — said they are highly likely to finance at least one of their holiday purchases. Shoppers are financing even lower-priced gifts using BNPL.</p><p>The average order value of those BNPL deals over Thanksgiving fell by 6%, according to the separate data released by Salesforce on Friday.</p><p>Salesforce expects BNPL usage to \"ramp up with the big shopping days\" — namely, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p><p>\"One of the worst things consumers can do is finance gifts on a credit card that they don't intend to pay off at the end of the month, especially in a rising interest-rate environment,\" said Anuj Nayar, financial health officer at LendingClub, a financial services company based in San Francisco, Calif.</p><p>\"Now more than ever, it's important to live within your means,\" he said.</p><p>Online sales on Black Friday are up just 1%</p><p>BNPL services, in particular, are seeing surging adoption rates, driven by growing merchant acceptance, booming e-commerce sales, and what many providers say is a skepticism among younger shoppers about traditional credit offerings.</p><p>In the credit-card model, merchants pay transaction fees when they accept card payments and consumers pay accrued interest if they carry a balance.</p><p>BNPL services, which can sometimes be interest-free to the consumer, charge a steeper fee to merchants, which have been increasingly willing to pay for the services so that consumers will be more inclined to go through with an online purchase.</p><p>Some 37% of Americans plan to use financing such as personal loans, credit cards and BNPL this holiday season, up from 34% in 2021, according to the holiday season report from LendingClub.</p><p>From 2019 to 2021, the dollar volume of BNPL loans issued by five big BNPL firms — Affirm Holdings Inc. AFRM Afterpay Ltd. Klarna, PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL and Zip Co. ZIP increased by 1,092% from $2 billion to $24.2 billion, according to a report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p><p>\"Buy now, pay later is a rapidly growing type of loan that serves as a close substitute for credit cards,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra told reporters at a virtual news conference in September. </p><p>\"We will be working to ensure that borrowers have similar protections, regardless of whether they use a credit card or a buy now, pay later loan,\" he added.</p><p>E-commerce sales on Black Friday are expected to be almost flat this year, Adobe said. Online sales for Black Friday are expected to reach $9 billion, up just 1% on the year.</p><p>However, Cyber Monday will be this year's \"biggest online shopping day,\" with online sales reaching $11.2 billion, up 5.1% year-over-year.</p><p>Erik Carter, senior financial planner at Financial Finesse, a workplace financial coaching provider in El Segundo, Calif., advised consumers not to allow discounts over the holiday season to tempt them to overspend.</p><p>Instead, use Black Friday as an opportunity to invest in things that were already on your shopping list, he added.</p><p>(Emily Bary contributed to this report.)</p><p>Black Friday dilemma: More people use 'buy now, pay later' for holiday shopping, but experts say that's a double-edged sword</p>",
