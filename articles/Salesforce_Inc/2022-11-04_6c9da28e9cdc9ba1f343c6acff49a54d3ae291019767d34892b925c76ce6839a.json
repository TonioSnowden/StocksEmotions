  "title": "The cloudburst is upon us: Cloud-software stocks suffering worst declines on record; Atlassian , Twilio stocks both shed a third of their value Friday on their worst day yet, and other cloud-software declines are sending ETFs tracking the industry to their worst week on record amid forecasts that show slowing growth",
  "text": "<p>The First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY, the Global X Cloud Computing ETF CLOU, and the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD fell as much as 5% Friday, with the latter two heading for their worst week on record; the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF was on track for its second worst week on record, after a 12.6% decline in the week ending Aug. 19, 2011.</p><p>Leading the race for the bottom for cloud-software were shares of Atlassian Inc. TEAM and Twilio TWLO, which were both easily heading for their worst day ever having both shed a third or more of their value in Friday trading. Late Thursday, Atlassian execs said customers were converting to paid subscriptions from freemium versions at a slower pace. Twilio caught a two-notch downgrade from B. of A. Securities analyst Michael Funk before the company forecast a poor outlook.</p><p>Companies like Atlassian and Twilio were seen as a strong bet heading into a recession, as cloud software can help to reduce costs from legacy software as well as create efficiencies within organizations. Raymond James analyst Adam Tindle, in detailing the read-throughs on Atlassian's report, explained how that view is now changing on Wall Street.</p><p>Atlassian's results \"suggest even the most diversified, low cost, visible growth models (cloud transition) are not immune to this brutal macro environment and shares are de-rating accordingly,\" they wrote.</p><p>\"We do see the cloud transition as a 'when not if' and pricing incentives to move existing customer to Cloud will create an uplift upon renewals, but we have concerns around 70% of Cloud customers being on monthly plans that are easy to turn off if economic distress continues,\" Tindle continued, while maintaining a \"market perform\" rating.</p><p>Cowen analyst Derrick Wood, who has a market perform rating on Atlassian, characterized the company's miss on billings as \"rare,\" and also pointed out another weakness.</p><p>As layoffs and hiring freezes are playing out across the tech industry, Wood said fewer big customers are growing out their capacity because of fewer developers are being hired.</p><p>\"We see Atlassian enjoying incumbency advantages alongside low-cost products, but the company is undergoing a multi-year model transition to the cloud and shift in pricing structure; meanwhile there have been several formidable competitors entering the market with compelling consumer-grade software packages,\" the Cowen analyst said.</p><p>Then again, Atlassian sees the problem as an oppurtunity, as in hiring talent from a large pool.</p><p>\"There's a lot of incredible people in the market who may only come on the market once a decade and may have an opportunity to pick those staff up now,\" said Scott Farquhar, Atlassian co-chief executive and co-founder on a conference call with analysts. \"And so, we've been really thoughtful around kind of how many we hire and where we hire.\"</p><p>\"But our experiences that we can come out really strong on the other side by selectively picking out staff that other people letting go,\" Farquhar said.</p><p>Declines bled over to the largest cloud-software names as well Friday, even as most have yet to report earnings this season. Salesforce Inc. CRM shares fell up to 7%, and were headed for their worst week since August 2011, and Service Now Inc. NOW shares declined 7% and were headed for their worst week since February 2016. Shares of Okta Inc. OKTA fell as much as 12%, Snowflake Inc. SNOW shares fell as much as 14%, MongoDB Inc. MDB shares dropped 9%, and Workday Inc. WDAY shares fell 6%.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of cybersecurity company Cloudflare Inc. NET dropped as much as 20% following earnings late Thursday, pulling down other names in the space like Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, Zscaler Inc. ZS, and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD all of which were down 6% or more.</p><p>Fortinet Inc. FTNT kicked off that decline Thursday, after forecasting fourth-quarter billings late Wednesday that undershot analysts' expectations, sending shares down nearly 14% in Thursday trading. Fortinet's stock was on track for its worst week since October 2015, according to FactSet records.</p><p>Read: Security-software stocks are suffering from this one gloomy forecast</p><p>Cybersecurity stocks specifically were heading for their worst week in 2Â½ years, with the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF HACK down more than 10%, its worst since a 13% drop the week ended March 13, 2020. The First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF CIBR was down nearly 11%, also on track for its worst week since early 2020.</p><p>Of the various cloud-computing ETFs year to date, CIBR is faring best with a 29% drop, and WCLD is performing the worst with a 55% drop, compared with a 22% fall on the S&amp;P 500 index SPXand a 34% drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index.
