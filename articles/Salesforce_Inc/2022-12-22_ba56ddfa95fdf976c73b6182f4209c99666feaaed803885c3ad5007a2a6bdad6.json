  "text": "<p>Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy capped a whirlwind day in Washington <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/649a2fe5-aedf-44c9-9e5d-6a573a6ea3e6\">with an impassioned plea to Congress</a> and the American people to keep up support for Kyiv after 300 days fighting Russia's invasion.</p> <p>“Your money is not charity, it's an investment in the global security and democracy,” he told a joint session of Congress.</p> <p>His appearance evoked comparisons to an address to members of Congress by UK prime minister Winston Churchill during the second world war in 1941 and came just weeks before Republicans were set to take control of the House.</p> <p>He framed Kyiv's fight as a global one and an important moment in a struggle to preserve the world order as he sought to shore up support from a critical ally in his first trip out of Ukraine since Russia invaded in February.</p> <p>Before his address Zelenskyy met Joe Biden at the White House where he presented the president with a military medal from a frontline soldier commanding a unit armed by a US-supplied mobile artillery system.</p> <p>The US president touted $1.85bn in new assistance, including a long-sought Patriot missile defence battery, and assured his Ukrainian counterpart that Washington was prepared to stand by Kyiv “as long as it takes”.</p> <p>But after nearly four hours of talks, there were some clear signs of tension between the two presidents.</p> <p>Zelenskyy questioned whether he could ever reach a “just peace” with Russia's president Vladimir Putin after Biden and his officials argued that that was the outcome Ukraine's president was fighting for.</p> <p>“There can't be any ‘just peace' in the war that was imposed on us,” he said, adding Kyiv would not agree to anything short of a return to full territorial integrity and “payback for all the damages inflicted by Russian aggression”.</p> <p>Zelenskyy's visit to Washington comes at a critical time in the 10-month war. Officials in Kyiv have warned Moscow is gearing up for a possible winter offensive.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go Deeper:</strong> The Patriot missile system was the centrepiece of a new $2bn weapons package announced by Joe Biden yesterday. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/051ac9dd-346e-43ff-83fc-e3921defb253\">Here is what it will mean for Ukraine's defences.</a></p></li> </ul> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.

Fears that the trio are unwilling to relinquish control are diminishing the appeal for what should be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36a105ce-f048-451e-bbc8-6136ec932f96\">one of the most coveted jobs on Wall Street</a>.</p> <p><strong>Tech giants ditch office space in London and Europe </strong>Google's parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and enterprise software giant Salesforce are among the US technology groups seeking to abandon leased office space in London and Dublin.
