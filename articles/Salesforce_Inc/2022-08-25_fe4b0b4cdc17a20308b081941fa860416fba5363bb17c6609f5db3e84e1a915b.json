  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, Salesforce Inc., one of the largest vendors of cloud business software, reduced its full-year outlook. The sales software vendor said it expected annual sales of between $30.9 billion to $31 billion, from previously projected revenue of between $31.7 billion and $31.8 billion.</p><p>Customers are taking longer to sign deals as they become more careful with their spending, said Bret Taylor, co-chief executive of Salesforce.</p><p>\"Conversations have meaningfully shifted not just to growth, which was the main priority in 2021, but also to cost savings and efficiency,\" he said. \"Every single company right now is focused on bottom-line performance and cost savings.\"</p><p>Salesforce's shares were down about 5% on Thursday following the earnings report.</p><p>After accelerated growth in cloud business during the pandemic as workplaces were pushed to adopt more digital tools, a more conservative business environment is putting a damper on the industry.</p><p>Global spending on technology, which includes cloud services, is expected to rise about 3% this year, well below the 10% annual growth in 2021 and the nearly 7% gain the year before, according to Gartner Inc.</p><p>\"People will renew their existing software contracts, but they're going to buy less new software,\" in this environment, said John DiFucci, software analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC.</p><p>While cloud companies haven't been hit as hard as some tech companies that depend on advertising and consumer demand, the growing concerns about a possible recession have affected how they see the future.</p><p>Overall global cloud sales are expected to reach $830.5 billion this year, up 17.5% from the prior year, but slowing from last year's growth of 18.3%, according to International Data Corp. Growth is projected to slow further next year, with 16.3% growth, IDC said.</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Cloud Companies' Outlook Cools as Customers Tighten Spending</p>",
