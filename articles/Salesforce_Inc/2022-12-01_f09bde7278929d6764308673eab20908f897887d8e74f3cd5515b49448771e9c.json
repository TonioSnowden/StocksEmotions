  "title": "Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor leaving, stock falls after lower-than-expected forecast; Cloud-software stalwart projects fourth-quarter sales $900 million lower than Street expectations, shares decline 7% in after-hours trading",
  "text": "<p>The cloud-software company said in a news release that founder, co-CEO and Chairman Marc Benioff will resume the sole CEO role on Jan. 31. Taylor is the second executive to be elevated to co-CEO with Benioff, only to leave with Benioff still in charge. Keith Block stepped down in February 2020 after just 18 months in the position, and Taylor lasted exactly a year in the co-CEO position after being promoted Nov. 30 of last year.</p><p>\"I am grateful for six fantastic years at Salesforce,\" Taylor, who was also vice chairman, said in a statement. \"Marc was my mentor well before I joined Salesforce and the opportunity to partner with him to lead the most important software company in the world is career-defining. After a lot of reflection, I've decided to return to my entrepreneurial roots.\"</p><p>See more: Opinion: Salesforce better get used to Marc Benioff in charge, because he keeps chasing off his chosen successors</p><p>On the company's earnings call, Benioff said \"we're still in a little bit of shock and extremely sad\" about Taylor's exit, but did not answer an analyst's question about whether he would fill the co-CEO position.</p><p>At least one analyst said he didn't see the departure coming: \"Given that Mr. Taylor was assumed to be the 'heir apparent' at CRM, this does bring up a lot of questions in terms of the management team and frankly offsets some of the positive narrative around margins heading into [calendar year 2023],\" wrote Kirk Materne, analyst for Evercore ISI, in a note Wednesday.</p><p>Salesforce reported that third-quarter net income fell to $210 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $468 million, or 47 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for stock-based compensation and other costs, earnings were $1.40 a share. Revenue rose to $7.84 billion from $6.86 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Analysts, who have been expressing concerns about a slowdown in business-software spending, had forecast adjusted earnings of $1.22 a share on revenue of $7.83 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>\"We remain positive on the long-term outlook for Salesforce as front-office applications leader,\" Michael Turits, analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets, wrote ahead of the company's earnings report. \"That said, we remain cautious regarding the near-term outlook given ongoing recession concerns, slowing cloud spend, and weaker conversations we had with a few Salesforce channels this quarter.\"</p><p>Those concerns sprung up in the company's forecast, as Salesforce executives' guidance fell $900 million short of expectations. They expect fourth-quarter earnings of 23 cents to 25 cents a share on revenue in the range of $7.932 billion to $8.032 billion, and adjusted earnings of $1.35 to $1.37 a share. Analysts had forecast adjusted earnings of $1.44 a share on revenue of $8.94 billion.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver said on the earnings call that along with the \"unpredictable\" macroeconomic environment and some slowing in customer spending, the strong dollar had an impact on the company's showing. \"Foreign exchange continued to be a headwind for our results,\" she said.</p><p>Still, Weaver said the company remains committed to a goal of operating margins of 25% or above; in the third quarter it was at 22.7%, which she said was a record high. Among the things the company is doing, she said, is taking a measured approach to hiring. Earlier this month, the company confirmed hundreds of layoffs, though it did not address them during the call.</p><p>See: Tech layoffs approach Great Recession levels</p><p>In response to an analyst's question about employees working from home and the company's real-estate footprint, Benioff said the San Francisco-based company will have more employees in the office while maintaining the flexibility of remote work. \"We're never going back to how it was, we all know that,\" he said. Meanwhile, Weaver said the company is \"looking at every aspect of our real estate .\"</p><p>Shares of Salesforce have declined about 37% this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, whose 30 components include Salesforce, has fallen about 5% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX is down almost 15% this year.</p><p>Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor leaving, stock falls after lower-than-expected forecast</p>",
