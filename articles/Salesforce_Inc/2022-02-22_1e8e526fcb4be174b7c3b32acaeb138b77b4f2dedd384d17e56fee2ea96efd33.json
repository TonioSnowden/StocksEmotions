The number of reported outages decreased significantly by early afternoon.</p><p>Exercise-bike company Peloton also was having technical issues on Tuesday. The company said in a tweet that it was investigating an issue with its services. About an hour later, the company said on its website that it was \"seeing widespread recovery\" of its services. Downdetector showed 5,490 reports of the service being down as of 10:38 a.m. but reports dropped shortly afterward.</p><p>Temporary interruptions for popular social-media sites, websites and messaging platforms are relatively common. Some of the outages have been felt more widespread as many employees turn to cloud services and other connected platforms to help them work remotely during the pandemic.</p><p>Salesforce.com Inc. said in late 2020 that it agreed to purchase Slack in a $27.7 billion deal. The deal closed in July 2021.</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com and Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Glitches at Slack, Peloton Prompt Disruptions for Users</p>",
