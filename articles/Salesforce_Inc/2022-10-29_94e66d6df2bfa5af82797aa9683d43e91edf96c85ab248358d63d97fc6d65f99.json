  "title": "Musk Acts Fast After Twitter Takeover --- Top executives fired as entrepreneur vows to rethink platform's content moderation",
  "text": "<p>The acquisition teed up a host of questions that could take months or years to answer about how Twitter will change in the hands of the world's richest man, who has business interests in autos, rockets and other sectors stretching across the globe and who is one of the platform's most prominent -- and sometimes most provocative -- users.</p><p>The most immediate changes, with the transfer of control late Thursday, came within Twitter itself. Mr. Musk ousted Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal after the deal closed, The Wall Street Journal reported. He also fired Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's top legal and policy executive, and Sean Edgett, general counsel.</p><p>Some of the firings started before the paperwork to close the deal was completed, a person familiar with the matter said. The departures made for a frenetic and destabilizing afternoon, the person said, even as the question of the billionaire's ownership seemed to be settled. The person said he walked away from the monthslong process like a survivor stumbling off the battlefield.</p><p>Representatives for Twitter didn't comment.</p><p>The takeover follows months of uncertainty as Mr. Musk repeatedly changed his mind. The ultimate reversal came Oct. 3, when Mr. Musk said he planned to go through with the deal he had just spent months trying to exit, two weeks before a scheduled trial in Delaware Chancery Court.</p><p>Mr. Musk's options appeared to be narrowing. In the Twitter litigation, legal observers maintained from the beginning that the platform, which sued after Mr. Musk tried to walk away from the merger agreement, had the stronger case. Mr. Musk also was facing a judge who had rebuffed his earlier efforts to delay the trial and rejected some of his discovery requests.</p><p>Twitter and Mr. Musk quietly held unsuccessful talks about a possible cut to the price of $44 billion for the social-media platform before Mr. Musk reversed course and said he would return to the original agreement's price, people familiar with the matter said at the time.</p><p>Refinancing the agreement made in April would have required the banks to write new commitment letters, the person said, and higher interest rates would have made the debt more expensive.</p><p>On Thursday, hours after Twitter's leadership was ousted, Mr. Musk tweeted: \"the bird is freed\" in a seeming reference to Twitter, which has a blue bird as its logo. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday confirmed the deal closed Thursday, and that Twitter is now part of Mr. Musk's X Holdings I Inc.</p><p>Reaction to the deal was far-reaching and included politicians, regulators and business titans. It ran the gamut of enthusiasm to alarm and humor. Marc Benioff, who runs Salesforce Inc. alongside Bret Taylor, until Thursday Twitter's chairman, tweeted \"the bird is fried,\" with a picture of a plate of food. A top European Union official warned Mr. Musk about complying with the bloc's new rules on social-media moderation.</p><p>Mr. Musk on Friday tweeted that Twitter would be \"forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.\" He added: \"No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.\" In a tweet later Friday, he wrote: \"Anyone suspended for minor &amp; dubious reasons will be freed from Twitter jail.\"</p><p>Former President Donald Trump -- banned by Twitter on Jan. 8, 2021, in connection with the U.S. Capitol riot over tweets that company executives viewed as likely to inspire violence -- said \"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands.\" His former account remained suspended on Twitter as of Friday afternoon.</p><p>Mr. Musk has previously said that he disagreed with the ban and would restore Mr. Trump's account access, though Mr. Trump said at the time that he didn't intend to return to the platform.</p><p>Lack of content moderation has been a cause of concern for some advertisers, politicians and users who would prefer a more moderated platform. Mr. Musk, even before closing the deal for Twitter, on Thursday reached out to advertisers that underpin the bulk of the company's revenue to assuage them.</p><p>Mr. Musk said he was buying the company to \"have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner.\" He said Twitter \"cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!\"</p><p>Mr. Musk said the platform must be \"warm and welcoming to all\" and suggested Twitter could let people \"choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.\"</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear who would step into the top positions left vacant by Thursday's exits. Mr. Musk listed himself as \"Chief Twit\" in his Twitter bio. Whatever role Mr. Musk has at Twitter will be added to his numerous other business responsibilities, including as CEO of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</p><p>Mr. Musk's takeover leaves big questions over the future of the platform, including how he might revamp its business model and how he might implement changes he has proposed for the way it polices content.</p><p>Like other social-media companies, Twitter relies heavily on digital advertising and has faced headwinds in recent months due to broad economic uncertainty. General Motors Co. said Friday it is pausing its paid advertising on Twitter in the wake of Mr. Musk's acquisition, saying it wants more information about the site's direction under its new ownership. The Detroit auto maker, which competes against Tesla, characterized the move as a normal step when a media platform undergoes a significant change.</p><p>Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Twitter will also be saddled with billions in debt as a result of the deal, and payments on those loans will add costs for a company that has posted a loss in eight of its past 10 fiscal years.</p><p>---</p><p>Meghan Bobrowsky contributed to this article.</p>",
