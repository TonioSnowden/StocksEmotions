  "text": "<p>The Tadich Grill, the oldest restaurant in California, has stared down a crisis or two: earthquakes; several recessions; Covid-19. Founded in 1849, its current home on California Street puts it in the heart of the city's downtown Financial District, known as “FiDi”. And it is ground zero in the city's struggle to get people back to work.</p> <p>Jure Bracanović, one of the white-coated waiters, says the restaurant, like others nearby, has suffered as the lunch and dinner crowd switched to working from home, and convention business collapsed. The stream of delegates at tech events has almost entirely evaporated, in part due to the perception the city's streets are “dangerous”, he says.</p> <p>On its busiest days, arriving for lunch at the Tadich Grill could feel like muscling your way across the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. On this Monday, however, four patrons sit on stools at the wooden bar running from the front door to the kitchen. “Lots of offices are still closed,” Bracanović notes.</p> <p>Analysis by Kastle Systems, an office security company, suggests that San Francisco lags behind other major cities when it comes to returning to the office. Using data on keycard entries collected from more than 2,600 locations across the US, Kastle found that, in the first week of June, San Francisco's office occupancy was 31.6 per cent — 10 points below the average figure for 10 major cities, and behind New York.</p> <p>There are other troubling indicators, too. A recent report by the San Francisco Chronicle described the city's downtown as on the “brink” of disaster, after comparing data from the first quarter of 2019 with the same period this year. It found that the number of people exiting the rapid transit system at FiDi locations was down 76 per cent, and convention attendees were down 86 per cent. At the same time, vacant office space has increased from 4.8mn sq ft to 18.7mn.</p> <p>The collective effect of these trends can be observed simply by looking out the window: the afternoon rush hour used to see traffic from the notoriously congested Bay Bridge push back deep into the city's honking streets; but no longer — and, maybe, never again.</p> <p>San Francisco is the “most extreme” case of workers not returning to a major city, says Professor Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist. “Tech was already moving remote,” he notes.</p> <p>But this is bad news for people like London Breed, San Francisco's mayor since 2018, due to the “doughnut effect” of people moving out of the middle of cities in favour of surrounding areas. It means not coming into work, and no longer frequenting the businesses in these central areas. Or, at best, doing those things a lot less often than before.</p> <p>“If the doughnut effect happens, which it is, Breed loses all the tax revenue,” Bloom says. “I think that's one of the reasons why some of these politicians are getting really agitated.”</p> <p>Income for the city from sales tax in its two core business voting districts fell by almost 50 per cent from 2019 to $28.26mn in 2020, says the city's treasurer. Even with an uptick in 2021, income still falls well short. And so city officials are trying to save what they call San Francisco's “Economic Core”. As well as FiDi, this includes the waterfront Embarcadero area, the more industrial quarter known as SoMa and Mission Bay, a recently rejuvenated sector.</p> <p>In March, Breed introduced a “Welcome Back to SF” plan with the backing of some of the city's biggest employers, such as Uber, Salesforce and Meta, with each committed to implementing policies that would encourage a return.</p> <p>In May, as part of the city's revised budget, $47.9mn was earmarked to help the recovery of the Economic Core by increasing foot traffic. Within that, $6mn was set aside to pilot new ideas, such as establishing new uses for vacant ground floor spaces in office blocks.</p> <p>Another $2mn would be spent on the continued deployment of “Welcome Ambassadors” — people, sometimes retired police officers, stationed at highly-trafficked areas to reassure or assist the public, particularly during conventions. “Many of the people that interact with our ambassadors say [the city] is not at all what they expected, based on the narrative that is out there,” says Katherine Daniel, San Francisco's director of economic recovery initiatives. For office workers, programmes designed to increase entertainment options in business districts are seen as one possible way to entice regular workers back.</p> <p>“I think that it's going to be a bit of a snowball effect,” Daniels says. “As people start to come into the office, more people are going to want to come into the office because they want to be around their colleagues.”</p> <p>For now, none of the leading tech employers in the city is seeking a full-scale return. Quite the opposite, in some cases: Airbnb, conspicuous in its absence from any return-to-work pledge, is encouraging its employees to work wherever they want in the world, though it says it is giving its backing to efforts to revive the city's tourism.</p> <p>In a tight labour market, companies may be reluctant to put their full weight behind a return to the office, given that workers for now show a strong preference for, at the least, hybrid working.</p> <p>“I think one thing that the city could do is to act as a co-ordinator among private sector employers,” suggests Enrico Moretti, professor of economics at UC Berkeley. “Each high-tech company in isolation might be reluctant to go back more aggressively than its competitors. If the city was to co-ordinate, and basically bring all the tech companies around the table, it would take away the fear of being the first to do it.”</p> <p>Even if that does occur, a successful return to office is unlikely to mean a complete return to the Monday-Friday life of old. The Economic Core, like similar areas in other leading cities around the world, will need to adapt or die.</p> <p>Rodney Fong, president of San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, believes city officials must lean on what makes the city unique. “People choose to work in San Francisco because of the collection of intellectual talent that is here,” he says. “It's fun to be with other creative people, other innovators. It's fun to share arts and culture with your colleagues. That soul of the city that San Francisco has is critical to the business economic future.”</p><p>Source: Dave Lee 2022 'San Francisco's battle to bring a digital city back to real life' FT.com 27 June.
