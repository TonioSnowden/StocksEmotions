Speaking at the FT's Global Banking Summit, he warned that higher taxes threaten the city's future appeal.

For private equity, mining a balance sheet from the comfort of a Manhattan office tower comes with its own risks (and rewards) too.</p> <p>The clash of interests between miners in Alabama and private equity titans is now evident at <strong>Warrior Met Coal</strong>. Workers there have been on strike for eight months, blaming the company's former owners <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>KKR </strong>for low pay and poor benefits as DD's Sujeet Indap and Antoine Gara <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d8ee1b9-9a6d-422c-a53d-b166678eaec2\">report</a>. </p> <p>Here's the back story: the private equity firms bought Warrior out of bankruptcy in 2016 through distressed debt positions.</p> <p>The new company shed crippling pension liabilities to the US government's <strong>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</strong> and struck a new labour contract that cut miners' pay by 20 per cent. The cleansed balance sheet, a $200m equity infusion and lean cost structure set it up to enjoy a recovery in coal prices.</p> <p>But Warrior's quickly improved fortunes accrued mostly to its PE overlords, who pulled nearly $800m in cash off of its balance sheet through special dividends, not miners, says the <strong>United Mine Workers of America</strong>.</p> <p>Warrior paid a $190m dividend before its 2017 initial public offering, then a $600m dividend funded with cash and debt. By 2019, the buyout firms were entirely out of Warrior, which paid an additional $580m in special dividends to shareholders in 2018 and 2019.</p> <p>In April of this year, miners rejected a new labour contract offer and went on strike. </p> <p>In November, senators <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, <strong>Tammy Baldwin</strong> and <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>, sent a<a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-sanders-baldwin-question-private-equity-firms-apollo-and-blackstone-on-warrior-met-coal-amid-ongoing-worker-strikes\"> letter</a> to Apollo and Blackstone criticising their gains at Warrior, writing that the trio “appear[ed] to have made off like bandits”.&#xa0;</p> <p>People close to the investors counter that their investment at Warrior saved thousands of jobs, while annual incomes of hourly workers jumped from $75,000 to $97,000 between 2016 and 2021.</p> <p>Private equity firms now repeatedly argue that they are increasingly forces for good and leading the charge on ESG compliant investing. </p> <p>The reality on the ground, however, is far messier.</p> <h2>The power of Pfizer</h2> <p><strong>Albert Bourla</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97c597dc-03b1-4ece-a302-f9793698ded6\">is a man in very high demand</a>. </p> <p>The chief executive has gained global recognition almost unlike any other company boss thanks to <strong>Pfizer</strong>'s Covid vaccine. </p> <p>When he's not parking his private jet next to <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>'s, or being ushered into Japanese palace guesthouses, Bourla regularly fields calls from world leaders desperate to get more vaccine batches for their people.</p> <p>No one can deny the incredible effectiveness of the <strong>BioNTech/Pfizer</strong> vaccine which has saved half a million lives and allowed economies to return (mostly) to normal.</p> <p>But the scientific and financial success of the vaccine has allowed Pfizer almost unmitigated power in deciding which countries get jabs, how many and at what price, with little to no repercussions. </p> <p>Pfizer's opaque power is chronicled in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cea5e3f-d4c4-4ee2-961a-3aa150f388ec#7972084\">this FT deep-dive</a>.</p> <p>While millions in the UK, US and other rich countries count themselves lucky to have been double or even triple-jabbed with Pfizer, people in poorer nations are far from happy. </p> <p>Pfizer has repeatedly signed deals with rich countries — which the drugmaker charges more for its vaccine — ahead of poorer ones.</p> <p>Big Pharma has long been accused of placing profit over medical need and Pfizer is no exception. The African Union's agonising wait for vaccines stretched from weeks to months, and the group's leaders watched on despairingly as the drugmaker signed a new deal with the EU in the meantime. </p> <p>Pfizer is reaping record sums from vaccine sales, with the jab set to become the best-selling drug of the year globally. </p> <p>Booster campaigns have driven expected sales to a staggering $36bn this year, more than double <strong>Moderna</strong>'s expected sales and easily beating that of <strong>AbbVie</strong>'s <strong>Humira</strong>, which is forecast to be the best-selling non-Covid drug.</p> <p>Pfizer's dominance is also starkly evident in its marketing. </p> <p>The vaccine's mRNA technology was developed by German group BioNTech, yet BioNTech has been overshadowed. The fact that the vaccine is universally called the Pfizer jab is “the biggest marketing coup in the history of American pharmaceuticals”, one former US government official told the FT.</p> <p>With the spread of the Omicron variant spooking global markets, some are blaming Pfizer and its rival drugmakers for prioritising boosters for those already vaccinated, while the virus rips through and mutates in unvaccinated people, many of who are in developing countries.</p> <p>As booster programmes ramp up, Pfizer's earnings will rise in tandem. So too likely will its power. </p> <h2>CMA's move to block Facebook deal signals new era</h2> <p>Regulators in the EU and US have been under pressure to go after so-called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/917a1c17-56d2-4f2c-9a9e-85c804098e92\">killer acquisitions</a>, whereby a big tech company buys a smaller rival to eliminate future competition.</p> <p>Their critics point to <strong>Facebook</strong>'s acquisition of <strong>Instagram</strong> or <strong>WhatsApp</strong>, or <strong>Google</strong>‘s takeover of <strong>Fitbit </strong>as examples of transactions that shouldn't have been approved. </p> <p>Their logic? If these businesses had continued operating independently then they would have created a more competitive environment for today's Big Tech players.</p> <p>Well it seems the critics' prayers have been heard. On Tuesday the UK's competition watchdog, the <strong>Competition and Markets Authority</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af93369a-56fe-4d79-ad68-42e40404291f\">blocked</a> Facebook owner <strong>Meta</strong>'s acquisition of gif-sharing platform <strong>Giphy</strong>.</p> <p>The regulator also ordered the company to sell Giphy to an “approved buyer” following concerns that the deal would harm competitors in the digital advertising space. Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/895fb5c7-96c6-4294-b514-0e9cea5de405\">wasn't impressed</a>. </p> <p>This is the first time the regulator has blocked such a deal. It's also bad news for the sector because other jurisdictions — including Brussels and Washington — are likely to want to follow the UK's lead. </p> <p>Opponents of the move have warned that this might harm innovation because there are many founders who dream of being bought for millions by a larger rival. But proponents of the decision will say this is good for competition and that the days of naive regulators are over.</p> <p>The CMA's move comes as part of a global drive to stop large tech platforms buying rivals before they become too big and a threat to their businesses.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1880d0fb-0651-47ed-a8f4-6cde0f729859\">EU regulators</a> are currently dusting off old tools to see if they can legally claim jurisdiction over deals where the target has no revenues in the economic bloc but where there are concerns that a merger could undermine competition and hurt innovation.</p> <p>Under proposed tech rules in Brussels, acquisitions that previously were more difficult to detect or block will be under more intense scrutiny over concerns in Europe. The mood music is the same in the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We want tech to compete fairly and that can't happen if you have monopolies that are just crushing that sector, gobbling up competitors and preventing people from thriving or growing because they just make it impossible to compete,” said US congressman<strong> David Cicilline </strong>at an FT-ETNO event on Monday. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Zara </strong>owner <strong>Inditex </strong>has appointed <strong>Marta Ortega</strong>, the 37-year-old daughter of the clothing group's founder, to chair, sending its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57283cb1-20d8-43a7-85aa-6ca59a49099c\">shares falling</a>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f159ffc9-65d8-4206-bf81-41b42689228b\">hired</a> <strong>Philip Dormitzer</strong> as global head of vaccines research and development. He was previously chief scientific officer at <strong>Pfizer</strong> and led the drugmaker's viral vaccines portfolio, including its work on Covid-19. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Salesforce</strong> has promoted <strong>Bret Taylor</strong> to co-CEO alongside <strong>Marc Benioff</strong>, who founded the software company. He joined Salesforce in 2016 through the acquisition of <strong>Quip</strong>, his productivity start-up.
