  "title": "Technology:  Spinoff  Of SAP  Leaps 38%  In Debut  ----  By Matt Grossman",
  "text": "<p>   Shares of Qualtrics International Inc., a spinoff from SAP SE, rose roughly 38% in its public-markets debut amid a surge of investor interest in the enterprise-software sector. </p><p>   Qualtrics, which makes software for businesses to track customer interactions, brands and employees, opened at $41.85 Thursday afternoon, compared with its initial public offering price of $30 a share. The opening price values the company at approximately $24.5 billion. Qualtrics is trading on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol \"XM.\" </p><p>   The company arrives on the public market during a pandemic that has amplified a digital transition many businesses are undertaking as they adopt tools to boost interaction with customers online and to better run internal processes. That focus on digital operations has heightened the importance of Qualtrics's products, the company's chief executive, Zig Serafin, told The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   Investors have rewarded companies that support digital commerce. Shares of companies such as Salesforce.com Inc., whose software helps businesses manage customer relationships, and Square Inc., a digital-payments company, have surged over the last 12 months. Others such as Snowflake Inc., a data-warehousing company, have preceded Qualtrics in launching successful pandemic-era IPOs. </p><p>   SAP, based in Germany, maintains a controlling stake in Qualtrics following Thursday's offering, owning 84% of the company's common stock and 98% of its voting rights. SAP acquired Provo, Utah-based Qualtrics for $8 billion in 2019. </p><p>   The two years under SAP's ownership lifted Qualtrics's international reach, Mr. Serafin said. The company's sales coming from international markets amounted to 28% in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 23% in all of 2018. </p><p></p>",
