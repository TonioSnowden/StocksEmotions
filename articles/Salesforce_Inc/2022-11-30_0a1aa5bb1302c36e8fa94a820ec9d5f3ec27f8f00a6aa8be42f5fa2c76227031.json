He announced his departure as the company reported third-quarter revenue of $7.84 billion, slightly above analyst expectations. Profit was down to $210 million from $468 million a year earlier.</p><p>Mr. Taylor's departure marks another recent C-suite change for the San Francisco-based provider of cloud-based software.
