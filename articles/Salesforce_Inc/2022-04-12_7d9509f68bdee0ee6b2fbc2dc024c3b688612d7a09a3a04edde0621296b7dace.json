  "title": "Yelp Joins Apple, Citigroup, Other Companies Covering Travel Costs for Abortions; Expansion comes as more states pass restrictions for reproductive healthcare, causing some people to seek out-of-state care",
  "text": "<p>The San Francisco-based review platform joins companies including Citigroup Inc., Bumble Inc., Match Group Inc., Apple Inc. and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. in expanding care for reproductive healthcare, including for an abortion.</p><p>The moves follow the implementation of the country's strictest abortion law in effect in Texas, which bans abortion after six weeks, and the passage of more restrictions on the procedure in states including Idaho, Florida and Oklahoma.</p><p>The Texas law has pushed many women to travel out-of-state for care, according to clinics and abortion-rights advocates. Clinics in states like Illinois are also preparing for a potential influx of more patients as a pivotal coming Supreme Court decision could alter the landscape for federally protected abortion rights in the U.S.</p><p>Yelp Chief Diversity Officer Miriam Warren said the company's new policy, which goes into effect next month, was in response to the Texas law, which she described as a restriction on equality.</p><p>\"When we're talking about women's advancement in their careers, trying to diversify boardrooms to see more women in them, and you look at these restrictions, they are absolutely intertwined in a way that I think is very damaging,\" Ms. Warren said, adding that when women don't have control over expanding their families, they don't have control over their career success.</p><p>Abortion and reproductive health have often been topics that people shy away from talking about, Ms. Warren said. \"In the face of these laws, that is no longer an option,\" she said, noting she hopes more companies consider implementing similar benefits.</p><p>Others have also taken action.</p><p>Citigroup, in a proxy filing for its April shareholder meeting, said that starting this year it is offering travel benefits for employees to seek resources due to changes in reproductive healthcare laws. More than 10,000 full- and part-time Citi employees live in Texas.</p><p>The benefits apply to employees covered by the company's medical plan, which include full-time and part-time workers. Abortions were already covered under the company's medical benefits.</p><p>A representative for the company declined to comment further on the policy.</p><p>Tech giant Apple, which is expanding its presence in Austin with a new $1 billion, 3-million-square-foot campus, also said its health-insurance policies cover abortion services and travel fees if necessary.</p><p>Match Group, the parent company of dating apps such as Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge, and dating-app company Bumble both created funds last year to assist employees needing to travel outside of Texas for abortions. Both companies are Texas-based.</p><p>Match Chief Executive Shar Dubey set up a partnership between Match and Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion services to out-of-state workers, according to a spokeswoman for the company. That branch of Planned Parenthood has started a program to support Match employees in Texas, a Match spokeswoman said.</p><p>Abortion-law experts say companies could play a role in assisting employees in accessing abortions if the Supreme Court weakens or eliminates federal protections for the procedure, making state laws all the more significant.</p><p>\"I think there is this moment of all hands on deck,\" said Rachel Rebouché, interim dean of the Beasley School of Law at Temple University and an expert in reproductive-health law.</p><p>States supporting abortion rights have been bolstering protections through legislation, while clinics in those areas are preparing for an anticipated influx in patients coming in from out of state.</p><p>Lawmakers aiming to weaken state abortion protections, meanwhile, have introduced 529 restrictions from the start of 2022 through the end of March, according to analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks state laws and supports abortion rights.</p><p>In March, Florida and Arizona lawmakers passed 15-week bans on abortion, mirroring Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Mississippi law before the Supreme Court. Wyoming became the 13th state to pass a trigger law, which would ban abortion in the state if the high court overturns Roe v. Wade. Idaho became the first state to pass similar legislation to the Texas Heartbeat Act, which has been in place since Sept. 1. The Idaho Supreme Court temporarily blocked the law Friday.</p><p>In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a near-total ban on abortion Tuesday. The law bans abortion from the beginning of pregnancy except if the life of the mother is in danger. It also violates current constitutional protections for abortion established by the Supreme Court. Abortion-rights groups said they plan to challenge the law.</p><p>The Texas law created a new enforcement structure that allows private citizens to bring civil lawsuits against abortion providers as well as anyone who aids or abets an abortion. In the first four months after the law took effect, Planned Parenthood said its health centers in nearby states like Oklahoma, New Mexico and Colorado reported a jump in Texas patients. Residents from the Lone Star State made up more than half of abortion patients at Oklahoma clinics after the law took effect, compared with just 10% of total patients before then, Planned Parenthood said.</p><p>\"The future post-Dobbs is one riven with interstate conflict,\" said Ms. Rebouché. \"Companies are part of that.\"</p><p>Reaction to the new laws has varied. A number of companies condemned the Texas law last year. Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff said in September the company would help employees relocate from the state if they wished to.</p><p>In Idaho, Micron Technology Inc. is reviewing the state's new legislation, a representative for the Boise-based company said. \"If necessary, we will share any updates with our team members as appropriate,\" the representative said.</p><p>Shelley Alpern, director of corporate engagement at Rhia Ventures, an investing organization that focuses on innovation in reproductive and maternal healthcare, said her firm wrote to roughly 30 companies last September asking about their coverage for out-of-state travel to seek an abortion. She said doing so was something her firm was talking about for months but that it became critical after Texas passed its more restrictive legislation.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you expect your employer's health benefits to include reproductive services? Join the conversation.</p><p>\"It's clear that companies are starting to wake up around this,\" she said.</p><p>Texas Republicans have pushed back on the company policies.</p><p>\"Republicans should avoid entrusting their finances with Citibank and other companies that are hostile to them and their values,\" said Matt Rinaldi, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas.</p><p>State Rep. Briscoe Cain said he sent a cease-and-desist letter to Citigroup's chief executive in March over its policy. In his letter, the Republican said he would introduce legislation that would prevent Texas localities from working with companies that provide coverage for abortion or pay for abortion-related expenses, like travel. Mr. Cain didn't respond to requests for further comment.</p><p>A representative for Citigroup declined to comment on the letter.</p><p>The debate around abortion, a sensitive topic that has divided Americans for decades, can be complicated for both companies and employees. But some abortion advocates and policy experts say the latest moves supporting reproductive healthcare could help bolster abortion rights as new state restrictions take effect.</p><p>\"It does feel like there is an opening here for companies to really step in and step up,\" said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate on state issues at the Guttmacher Institute. \"You need a real groundswell of support.\"</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com and Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Yelp Joins Apple, Citigroup, Other Companies Covering Travel Costs for Abortions</p>",
