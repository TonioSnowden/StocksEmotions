  "text": "<p>ImmPACT Bio, which is establishing its headquarters in the West Hills section of Los Angeles, engineers CAR-T treatments to prevent cancers from evading or resisting treatment. Cancerous cells, for example, could cease to express the marker that a CAR-T drug targets. ImmPACT's lead drug binds to both CD19 and CD20, reducing the risk that cancer will be able to escape the treatment, Chief Executive Sumant Ramachandra said.</p><p>In Phase 1 clinical trials of this drug, seven of eight patients achieved and remain in complete remission, according to the company. Patients in the trial haven't developed neurotoxicity, ImmPACT said. Other companies developing novel cellular immunotherapies include Caribou Biosciences Inc., which went public in 2021.</p><p>With this funding from venBio Partners, Foresite Capital, Decheng Capital, and others, ImmPACT plans to further develop this treatment and other drugs in its pipeline.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Top News</p><p>Lex Rovner, co-founder and chief executive of startup 64x Bio.

Startup 64x Bio has secured $55 million in a financing round led by venture firm Lifeforce Capital to use its cell line-engineering technology to improve production of gene therapies now under development for a growing number of disorders.</p><p>The company aims to help drugmakers better produce viruses for gene therapies, which use non-disease-causing viruses to deliver healthy genes into cells of patients. The healthy genes compensate for missing or defective genes.</p><p>Drugmakers increasingly are betting on the approach to battle diseases. Novartis AG, for example, in December agreed to pay up to $1.5 billion to acquire Gyroscope Therapeutics, a British startup with a potential gene therapy for a form of age-related macular degeneration, which causes vision loss.</p><p>Viruses used to create gene therapies are made in human cells. Finding cells that make large volumes of viruses required for gene therapy is difficult, according to 64x Bio, which uses its technology to quickly zero in on genetic mutations that will turn cells into more-efficient virus producers.</p><p>$3 Billion</p><p>The amount of funding committed from ARCH Venture Partners and other investors to Altos Labs, a biotechnology startup seeking to reverse diseases, injuries and disabilities.</p><p>Pig kidneys transplanted into patient. Doctors in Alabama said that they had successfully transplanted a pair of pig kidneys into the body of a brain-dead person, potentially paving the way for clinical trials of animal-to-human transplants for patients in desperate need of kidneys and other organs.</p><p>The first-of-its-kind surgery was performed in late September at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and described in a paper published Thursday in the American Journal of Transplantation. The genetically engineered kidneys weren't immediately rejected by the recipient's body and showed limited function for the duration of the multiday experiment, the doctors said.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Share this email with a friend.</p><p>Forward ›</p><p>Forwarded this email by a friend?</p><p>Sign Up Here ›</p><p>Industry News</p><p>People</p><p>Healthcare investor Third Rock Ventures promoted David Kaufman to partner, and appointed Jigar Raythatha and Jeff Walsh as venture partners.
