On Estimize, the average projection is $4.54 billion.</p><p>Stock movement: Adobe's stock has declined in the session following each of the company's last five earnings reports.

Of the 32 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover the name, 17 have buy ratings and 15 have hold ratings, with an average price target of $365.41. Adobe shares recently changed hands just south of $330.</p><p>What to watch for</p><p>Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss will be looking for commentary on the Digital Experience outlook for fiscal 2023, after Adobe gave a forecast at its October investor day that implied about $4.98 billion in revenue at the midpoint.</p><p>\"This looks aggressive as the guide was in line with Street estimates despite the 2% FX [foreign-exchange] headwind and sensitive marketing exposure in a potentially worsening macro environment,\" he wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote that he expects results for the latest quarter to be roughly in line with expectations, while he too will be focused on the outlook.</p><p>The company's initial Digital Media forecast looked \"partly, but not entirely, de-risked,\" as Thill worries that job and budget cuts in corporate marketing departments could pressure Adobe's seat-based model.</p><p>He's \"concerned\" when it comes to Digital Experience, he added, noting that Salesforce Inc. CRM recently posted the slowest growth in its history for its marketing and commerce cloud business.</p><p>Evercore ISI's Kirk Materne offered that Adobe's numbers \"simply need to reinforce the idea that the FY23 outlook is reasonable and potentially leaves a little room for upside.\"</p><p>Still, he expects that the stock \"could settle into a bit of a trading range around current levels until we get a better sense of the timing of the Figma close.\"</p><p>Adobe earnings: What to expect</p>",
