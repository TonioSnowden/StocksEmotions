  "text": "<p>   The office is back open. The new challenge is convincing more people to use it. </p><p>   Companies that reopened spaces on a voluntary basis in recent months say they have often found the in-person experiences to be underwhelming. Some bosses observed that staffers spent much of their days hunched over laptops wearing headphones on video calls. Other workers arrived only to discover most of their colleagues were still at home, or on alternating hybrid schedules. The spontaneous collaboration offices once provided often didn't occur, executives say, and some workers who tried returning to offices quickly gave up and settled back into a routine of working at home. </p><p>   Employers say offices must be better -- and more effective -- in the pandemic era to consistently draw staff. To help, companies are rolling out new software to allow employees to better coordinate their visits with colleagues, while others are renovating spaces, upgrading in-office catering options or appointing staffers to monitor the office experience. A number of companies are also experimenting with scheduling, with some setting \"engagement days\" when all employees will be required to attend. </p><p>   The goal is to make offices more like a destination, said Leena Nair, chief human resources officer at Unilever PLC, which expects its employees to eventually work in offices about 40% of the time. In recent months, as it reopened offices, Unilever has created specific days when multiple teams can gather in the office at the same time. </p><p>   \"We're learning new ways,\" Ms. Nair said, adding that the company wants to prevent colleagues from working in isolation where, \"you get on your floor, you're the only person around -- no one else has come in that day.\" </p><p>   Physical spaces are also morphing, often to better support groups of employees. Technology giant Salesforce.com Inc. turned executive offices in its San Francisco headquarters into small-group conference rooms open to all employees. It is also tripling the size of some dining areas, moving out desks and adding more couches, TVs and whiteboards for teams to gather. Most offices will have about 60% of space devoted to collaboration, up from 40% prior to the pandemic, said Brent Hyder, president and chief people officer of Salesforce. </p><p>   Consulting giant Accenture PLC this spring opened a new office at the top of New York's One Manhattan West tower near the Hudson Yards development. The office is open to employees on a voluntary basis. Amenities include access to an outdoor terrace, sweeping views of the Hudson River and New York skyline, along with an interfaith prayer room, tech-free \"reflection zones,\" yoga and wellness areas and dozens of conference rooms, said Jack Azagury, Accenture's market unit lead for the northeastern U.S. </p><p>   To entice people, Accenture in recent months has also offered staffers free lunch coupons on Mondays and Fridays, when the office tends to be less busy. </p><p>   When the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA opens a new headquarters in Paris next year, the company plans to upgrade its catering, adding options for breakfast and an early dinner, knowing that many employees will likely commute fewer days to the office, but may want to squeeze in more meetings and time on-site with peers when they do attend. </p><p>   \"If people are only coming in two days to the office, we want them to be able to max it,\" said Paul Hudson, the company's chief executive. </p><p></p>",
