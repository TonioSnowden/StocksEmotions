  "title": "Wednesday's Markets:  Downturn in Stocks Accelerates  ----  By Caitlin McCabe and Vicky Ge Huang",
  "text": "<p>   Stock indexes declined on the first day of June, after capping a volatile trading month. </p><p>   All three major U.S. indexes handed back morning gains. The S&amp;P 500 lost 30.92 points, or 0.7%, to 4101.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 176.89 points, or 0.5%, to 32813.23, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite declined 86.93 points, or 0.7%, to 11994.46 </p><p>   On Tuesday, major U.S. indexes dropped, leading the S&amp;P 500 to end May roughly flat after a month marked by major moves in both directions. </p><p>   Few investors expect a reprieve from the volatility that has dominated markets this year. Many traders remain worried about the pace of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases and whether they will plunge the U.S. economy into a recession. Eight of the last 11 extended Fed rate-rise cycles have eventually ended in recession, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. </p><p>   Still, many traders say a recession isn't guaranteed, and any significant U.S. economic slowdown could be months away. That has led some investors to wade into the market and scoop up shares with beaten-down valuations, injecting more volatility into markets. </p><p>   Many investors and strategists say they are still questioning whether last week's rally, when all three major U.S. indexes jumped at least 6%, was the start of a more sustainable rebound or whether it was only a break from this year's selling pressure. </p><p>   \"Most of the gains we saw last week have been a bear-market rally,\" said Chris Wallis, chief executive and chief investment officer for Vaughan Nelson Investment Management. \"I think we will have prolonged volatility, but sometime between June and September there is a good chance for a market bottom.\" </p><p>   Mr. Wallis doesn't rule out the possibility of a recession, driven by a global growth slowdown and an inflation surge, this year. </p><p>    Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief U.S. equity strategist, came into the year with a bullish view on value stocks but now believes growth stocks, which have taken a beating this year, are undervalued. The Russell 1000 Value Index is down 6% this year, while the Russell 1000 Growth Index has plunged 23%. </p><p>   \"Oftentimes, the market acts like a pendulum. We think sometimes it swings too far in one direction or the other,\" he said. </p><p>   The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note advanced to 2.930%, from 2.842% Tuesday. Yields and bond prices move inversely. Yields on the benchmark note still remain well below this year's closing high of 3.124%, but have advanced this week as traders have continued to reassess the path of interest rates. </p><p>   Crude prices rose, as investors digested European Union leaders' plan to impose an oil embargo on Russia and a ban on insuring ships that carry Russian oil. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 0.6% to $116.29 a barrel. </p><p>    Salesforce surged $15.83, or 9.9%, to $176.07 after reporting revenue that outpaced analyst expectations, easing concerns about demand for its business software. The stock was the best performer in both the Dow and S&amp;P on Wednesday, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Shares of Victoria's Secret rose $3.68, or 8.9%, to $44.89 after recording a profit that exceeded expectations. </p><p>   Shares of energy companies swung between gains and losses in volatile intraday trading. Occidental Petroleum gained $1.11, or 1.6%, to $70.42. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 closed down 1%. </p><p>   Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.5% and South Korea's Kospi was down 1.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.1%. </p><p></p>",
