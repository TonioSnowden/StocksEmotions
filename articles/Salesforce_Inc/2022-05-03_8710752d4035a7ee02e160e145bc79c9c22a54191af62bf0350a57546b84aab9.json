  "title": "An Antiabortion Activist Was Arrested After Climbing Salesforce Tower in San Francisco; 22-year-old Maison Des Champs was taken into custody, police said; he says on social media he climbed the building to protest abortion",
  "text": "<p>A spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department identified the climber as 22-year-old Maison Des Champs from Las Vegas. He was arrested for trespassing and resisting arrest, the spokesman said.</p><p>Mr. Des Champs describes himself as antiabortion on his Instagram account and website. His actions come one day after the leak of a draft opinion indicated that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade, sparking protests on both sides of the abortion debate.</p><p>Mr. Des Champs climbed the building without any rope, according to the police spokesman, apparently climbing the steel frame surrounding the building's windows.</p><p>An Instagram post Tuesday showed Mr. Des Champs above San Francisco, standing on one of the building's steel ledges. The video was verified as authentic by Storyful, a news and intelligence company owned by News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Attempts to reach Mr. Des Champs through email were unsuccessful. A phone number listed under his name was out of service.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, the city's fire department posted a photo of a person climbing the building and warned people to stay away from the building.</p><p>The 1,070-foot tall tower opened in 2018 and is the headquarters of software company Salesforce Inc. The building is owned by Boston Properties Inc., according to the building's website.</p><p>Salesforce and Boston Properties didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Mr. Des Champs isn't the only one to scale skyscrapers for thrills, money or attention. Frenchman Alain Robert is famous for \"buildering\" around the world, from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the New York Times building in New York.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>An Antiabortion Activist Was Arrested After Climbing Salesforce Tower in San Francisco</p>",
