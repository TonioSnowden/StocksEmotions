  "text": "<p>While both Atlassian Inc. TEAM and Twilio Inc. TWLO shares raced for the bottom Friday, Twilio shares bounced back 6% Monday while Atlassian's fell 4%. Last week, Atlassian shares had their worst week ever after execs said customers were converting to paid subscriptions from freemium versions at a slower pace, while Twilio caught a two-notch downgrade from B. of A. Securities analyst Michael Funk before the company forecast a poor outlook.</p><p>From Late Friday: Think you had a bad week? Salesforce, cloud companies had some of their worst weeks ever</p><p>Those declines had bled over to the largest cloud-software names as well Friday, even as most have yet to report earnings this season. Last week, Salesforce Inc. CRM shares logged their worst week since 2011 with a 15% decline, and Service Now Inc. NOW shares fell 14.6% for the week. As Salesforce shares rose 2% Monday, Service Now shares declined 0.3%</p><p>On Monday, bright spots were seen in shares of Workday Inc. WDAY shares, which had their worst week ever last week and Okta Inc. OKTA shares, which had their second worst ever.</p><p>Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci upgrade both shares of Okta and Workday in a note Monday. DiFucci upgraded Okta to a buy from neutral, and Workday to a hold from a sell.</p><p>At the end of August, Okta sales rep churn was higher than usual because of\"short-term challenges\" with the company's assimilation of reps from last year's acquisition of Auth0.</p><p>\"While we recognize the company is facing challenges that could take several quarters to effectively address, we find current valuation levels too compelling to ignore,\" DiFucci said.</p><p>\"If the company even trips over anything positive, we would expect the stock to begin to re-rate towards a more reasonable multiple,\" said DiFucci, who expects execution issues are priced into the stock.</p><p>For Workday, DiFucci said the price has just fallen below his targets, and while he still believes Workday's goals of 20% or more annual average growth and revenue of $10 billion by 2026.</p><p>Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said software is \"still\" searching for the bottom.</p><p>\"Given the massive software sell-off, nowhere is safe, not even security, which used to be a safe haven,\" Thill said, adding it is going to be a cold winter with a tough macro environment.</p><p>Also, many software companies have \"seat-based\" models, which will get cut along with jobs, as tech sector layoffs roll outlike Elon Musk-owned Twitter.</p><p>And \"the Fed commentary or Friday jobs report didn't help either,\" said Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne, who called it a said it was a \"brutal week across software.\"</p><p>\"Earlier this week, we published a note discussing the growing importance of delivering a healthier balance of revenue growth and operating margin in terms of how investors are now valuing companies,\" Materne said, noting the dynamic favors larger companies.</p><p>Management teams that are \"committed to margin expansion\" include Salesforce and Workday in large-cap, and Splunk Inc. SPLK and Qualtrics International Inc. XM in small- to medium-caps, the analyst said. Materne has outperform ratings on all four stocks.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of Snowflake Inc. SNOW and MongoDB Inc. MDB shares continued with last week's losses and hares of cybersecurity company Cloudflare Inc. NET , fell along with shares of Zscaler Inc. ZS and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD.</p><p>Fortinet Inc. FTNT, which turbocharged last week's declines kicked off that decline Thursday, after forecasting fourth-quarter billings late Wednesday that undershot analysts' expectations.</p><p>Read: Security-software stocks are suffering from this one gloomy forecast</p><p>Cybersecurity stocks had their worst week in 2Â½ years, with the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF HACK down 9.6%, its worst since a 9.9% drop the week ended March 13, 2020. The First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF CIBR was down 9.8%, its worst week since early 2020.</p><p>Why Okta, Twilio and Salesforce are bucking the trend of cloud-software stocks' slide</p>",
