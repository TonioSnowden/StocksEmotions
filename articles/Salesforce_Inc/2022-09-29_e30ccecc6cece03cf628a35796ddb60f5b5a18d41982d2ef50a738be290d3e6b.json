  "title": "CIOs Still Waiting for Cloud Investments to Pay Off; Unrealistic expectations are forcing some tech leaders to rethink cloud costs; 'You discover your cloud architecture is immature when you're surprised by the bill'",
  "text": "<p>Katrina Agusti, chief information officer at workwear maker Carhartt Inc., said the company was surprised by the high cost of data storage after it began moving to the cloud in 2018.</p><p>Ms. Agusti said storage was cheaper when the Dearborn, Mich., company held data in its own data center. After it began migrating years' worth of data into the cloud, she said, \"what we realized quickly was we weren't going to be able to contain those costs.\"</p><p>Cloud computing was initially sold to businesses as a cost-effective way to quickly scale up and down their IT capabilities on an as-needed basis, offering near unlimited computer capacity with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Rather than run software and systems in their own hardware, commercial cloud users tap computing capabilities from providers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Companies today are compiling massive amounts of data in cloud storage services, and feeding it into increasingly sophisticated software and analytics tools designed to generate customer and market insights, among other benefits. They are also turning to multiple cloud providers, rather than relying on one cloud, for different systems and applications for different business areas. All of this can run up costs, corporate technology leaders and industry analysts say.</p><p>\"I must've had 10 conversations last week where CIOs were bemoaning that they had run out of money or blown their budget off,\" said John Roese, global chief technology officer of Dell Technologies Inc.</p><p>Mr. Roese said the primary reason for cloud budget overruns was that CIOs weren't thinking strategically about how to distribute IT capabilities across different cloud providers, and how to make them work together.</p><p>\"You discover your cloud architecture is immature when you're surprised by the bill,\" said Mr. Roese. \"Usually the reason it was expensive is that they processed the data in a suboptimal way, in the wrong place with the wrong tools with the wrong economic model.\"</p><p>Roughly 67% of 1,000 senior technology leaders at U.S. firms across industries said they have yet to see a significant return on cloud investments, KPMG said Thursday in its annual technology survey.</p><p>\"Many first movers expected significant IT cost efficiency from their cloud investments,\" said Barry Brunsman, a principal in KPMG's CIO Advisory group. \"We have seen a shift away from that expectation in favor of speed and agility.\"</p><p>Mr. Brunsman said the most common issues preventing a better return on cloud spending were insufficient talent or skills among tech teams, added security and compliance requirements, and a misalignment on expected outcomes.</p><p>Global cloud spending is projected to reach $830.5 billion by the end of the year, up 17.5% from 2021, but slowing from last year's growth rate of 18.3%, according to International Data Corp. It expects growth to drop to 16.3% next year.</p><p>Many companies accelerated ongoing efforts to move systems and apps into the cloud after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic to support the shift to remote work.</p><p>Some cloud vendors are lowering sales forecasts for the year ahead. In August, Salesforce Inc., one of the cloud market's largest business-software providers, said it expects annual sales of $30.9 billion to $31 billion, down from previously projected revenue of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion.</p><p>Amazon Web Services, the cloud-market front-runner, in July said sales rose 33% in the previous quarter, compared with a 37% increase a year earlier.</p><p>According to Kit Colbert, CTO of tech company VMware Inc., a number of companies in recent years have made aggressive pushes to get workloads into the public cloud. What they end up with in many cases is multiple clouds that have a lot of duplication and not a lot of consistency. \"We use the phrase cloud chaos,\" said Mr. Colbert.</p><p>Curt Garner, CTO of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., said it can be a challenge to balance the benefits of leveraging capabilities across multiple clouds with the complexity of working with systems that can be incompatible.</p><p>\"The cost of complexity in an organization can become significant,\" Mr. Garner said.</p><p>Diane Comer, chief information and technology officer at Kaiser Permanente, said that when the healthcare provider is working on a new initiative, it will price it out and compare an on-premises solution against one in the cloud.</p><p>\"You really do need to not just take it for granted that cloud is where you should head,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at Angus.Loten@wsj.com and Isabelle Bousquette at Isabelle.Bousquette@wsj.com</p><p>CIOs Still Waiting for Cloud Investments to Pay Off</p>",
