  "title": "AIX Ventures Gathers Top AI Talent to Invest in Startups; Co-founder and Investment Partner Richard Socher, former chief scientist at Salesforce.com, says deep technical expertise is critical for investors in AI",
  "text": "<p>The fund's name means \"AI plus X,\" Mr. Socher said. \"X is a parameter of a different industry and AI is kind of changing all these industries,\" he said.</p><p>The team also includes Pieter Abbeel, co-founder of robotics AI startup Covariant; Anthony Goldbloom, co-founder of machine-learning competitions startup Kaggle, now a subsidiary of Google; and Christopher Manning, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p><p>The firm, founded last year, has already made 15 new deals and transferred 25 of Mr. Socher's earlier investments into the fund.</p><p>About a third of its portfolio so far has been in healthcare and life sciences, such as Atomic.ai, which is involved in new molecule design, and Athelas, maker of an at-home blood test.</p><p>Mr. Socher said that AI advances in natural-language processing, for example, are especially exciting in life sciences.</p><p>\"Instead of predicting the next English word, you can predict the next protein,\" he said, adding that that capability opens up new opportunities in drug discovery.</p><p>AIX also invests in other sectors, including enterprise software, manufacturing and consumer. Its portfolio companies include weather-prediction startup Atmo, human-machine interface company Wispr AI Inc. and Time By Ping Inc., which automates legal billing.</p><p>San Francisco-based AIX raised capital from funds including Bain Capital Ventures, Foundation Capital, Khosla Ventures, Lux Capital and Village Global.</p><p>In an unusual structure for a venture firm, investment partners at AIX are working at the fund part-time, sourcing and evaluating deals, as well as acting as mentors to founders, Mr. Socher said.</p><p>AIX also has an operating team responsible for evaluating deals and helping companies post-investment. That's led by co-founder and General Partner Shaun Johnson, previously a vice president of engineering at startup Lilt, who's fully dedicated to AIX. On the operations team, Fang Yuan, a former investor at Baidu Ventures, is a part-time general operating partner.</p><p>This structure is best to provide support to AI startups that seek investors with deep technical expertise, Mr. Socher said. Maintaining such expertise in a field that moves as fast as AI research requires being immersed in it, he said, and that's why AIX Ventures' investment partners are keeping their other jobs.</p><p>\"The best AI entrepreneurs want the top AI practitioners on their cap table,\" Mr. Socher said, adding, \"to be a top practitioner, you can't be a full-time VC.\"</p><p>Write to Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com</p>",
