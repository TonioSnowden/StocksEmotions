  "text": "<p>   Adobe Inc. said fourth-quarter revenue rose 10% on continued strong demand for its software and services. </p><p>   The seller of Photoshop and other popular software on Thursday also issued profit guidance for the current quarter that was better than Wall Street analysts projected. </p><p>   Shares of Adobe, down 42% this year through Thursday's close, climbed in after-hours trading. </p><p>   The report comes as various business-software companies have indicated that customers are being more cautious on their spending plans due to a challenging economy. </p><p>   In recent weeks, Salesforce Inc., Okta Inc. and others have said that customers are taking longer to sign deals, clouding the outlook for the once-booming business software sector. </p><p>   Overall for the quarter ended Dec. 2, Adobe posted a profit of $1.18 billion, or $2.53 a share, compared with $1.23 billion, or $2.57 a share, for the same period of the prior year. </p><p>   Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings came in at $3.60 a share, ahead of analyst estimates for $3.50 a share, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Revenue came in at $4.5 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates. </p><p>   While Adobe left its outlook unchanged for its current fiscal year, it said it expects adjusted earnings of $3.65 to $3.70 in the current quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $3.64. </p><p>   It forecast revenue mostly in line with Wall Street estimates. </p><p>   Adobe in September agreed to buy Figma Inc., a rival design platform that offers cloud-based collaboration tools, for around $20 billion. It still expects the deal to close in 2023. </p><p></p>",
