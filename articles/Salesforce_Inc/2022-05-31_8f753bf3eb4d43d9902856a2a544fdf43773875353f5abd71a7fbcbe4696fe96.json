  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 425 points, or 1.3%, to 32,788.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 40 points, or 1%, at 4,118.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP slid 81 points, or 0.7%, to 12,050.</p><p>Stocks bounced sharply last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 6.2% to snap a run of eight straight weekly losses — its longest since 1932. The S&amp;P 500, which earlier this month came within a whisker of the arbitrary 20% pullback threshold that marks a bear market, rose 6.6% last week for its biggest weekly gain since March 2020, while the Nasdaq Composite, which fell into a bear market earlier this year, rose 6.8%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Heading into the final day of the month, the bounce from recent lows appeared to be stalling.</p><p>Analysts said last week's bounce was technically overdue, coming as the selloff that took the S&amp;P 500 to the brink of a bear market on May 19 left the market stretched to the downside by several measures.</p><p>The move to the downside saw steep sector selloffs that ranged from -2.6% for consumer staples to 34.3% for consumer discretionary, while the percentage of subindustries trading below their 50- and 200-day moving averages were more than two standard deviations below their 27-year means, noted Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, in a note. The S&amp;P 500 12-month forward earnings-per-share estimates declined to 16.8 times price — down 1.1% from its 20-plus year average and the lowest reading since April 2020.</p><p>\"These extremes hinted quite loudly that, like the release of an overstretched rubber band, the market was primed for at least a short-term snapback,\" Stovall said. \"And snap it did…The only question remaining is whether this rally will extend or evaporate. We remain skeptical of this rally's sustainability.\"</p><p>Interest-rate policy will be in the spotlight with President Joe Biden set to meet Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in the afternoon.In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Biden said he would not seek to influence the Fed's decisions.</p><p>A hawkish speech delivered Monday by Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, didn't seem to help sentiment. Waller saidhe supports half percentage point interest rate increases until there are signs inflation is cooling toward its 2% target.
