  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Personal Board of Directors: Catherine Powell --- Global Head of Hosting, Airbnb Inc.",
  "text": "<p>Getting there wasn't easy. The coronavirus pandemic closed global travel and crushed Airbnb's home-rental bookings. Ms. Powell initially headed Airbnb Experiences, which lets guests book guided activities such as mountaintop yoga, wine tastings and pottery classes with hosts. The health crisis shut down those kinds of outings.</p><p>The company faced backlash from hosts after announcing that it would fully refund guests for cancellations during the early months of the health crisis.</p><p>The pushback prompted Chief Executive Brian Chesky to consolidate hosts' management under Ms. Powell in July 2020. Ms. Powell became the company's global head of hosting.</p><p>Under Ms. Powell's leadership, the company started regular listening sessions with hosts. Last month, the company announced 50 upgrades to better service hosts.</p><p>Ms. Powell moved to Airbnb after a 15-year stint with Disney, where most recently she oversaw the company's theme parks in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>Here are the people she leaned on while finding her feet at Airbnb.</p><p>Andy Bird</p><p>CEO of Pearson PLC</p><p>Ms. Powell hadn't worked for a tech company before. Going from managing Disney theme parks to Airbnb experiences was daunting. She rang Mr. Bird, the former chairman of Walt Disney International and her longtime boss, while contemplating the job offer. \"You can do this because you're curious and ask the right questions,\" Ms. Powell recalls Mr. Bird saying. \"If you ask the 'Why,' you will understand how things work and then you'll know where you as a leader can add value.\" The advice came in handy during the pandemic.</p><p>Pip Marlow</p><p>CEO Salesforce Australia, New Zealand &amp; Southeast Asia</p><p>Ms. Marlow was the chief of Microsoft Australia when Ms. Powell ran Disney's operations there. A handful of women were country heads for global businesses at the time. They found each other and became close friends. Ms. Powell has turned to Ms. Marlow for help navigating a tech company. \"Pip was really, really good about giving me examples,\" Ms. Powell says. Ms. Marlow walked her through \"how an engineer's mind might work when they are problem solving or making their own prioritizations -- and how you need to ensure that when you communicate it's in the same way.\"</p><p>Cressida Cowell</p><p>Author of 'How to Train Your Dragon' book series</p><p>Ms. Powell and Ms. Cowell became fast friends in college. Both women married young. Their careers took off just as their children were born. \"So we were both going through that challenging time where you have a young family . . . and you're trying to juggle it all,\" said Ms. Powell. Ms. Powell leaned on her friend during the darkest days of the pandemic. Ms. Cowell helped Ms. Powell feel upbeat, and their conversations reminded her of what mattered in life. Those conversations were \"incredibly important as a survival technique,\" Ms. Powell said.</p><p>Peter Kwan</p><p>Airbnb host</p><p>Ms. Powell virtually met Mr. Kwan, an Airbnb host in San Francisco, at one of the company's listening sessions with homeowners last year. His suggestions led to the creation in October 2020 of Airbnb's first \"Host Advisory Board,\" whose 18 members come from around the world. \"He is such a strong voice,\" Ms. Powell said of Mr. Kwan. Mr. Kwan asked Ms. Powell how the company could train hosts to overcome biases, even unconscious ones. He also suggested photographing hosts' homes in ways that better reflect their personal stories, culture and heritage.</p>",
