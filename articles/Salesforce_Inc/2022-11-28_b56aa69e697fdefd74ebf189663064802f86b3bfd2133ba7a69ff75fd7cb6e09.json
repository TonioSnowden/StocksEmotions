  "title": "Cloud software is suffering a cold November rain. Can Snowflake and Salesforce turn it around? Earnings Watch: After a boom during the pandemic, concerns are mounting about business software spending spread ahead of a week of earnings results",
  "text": "<p>It has been a rough month for cloud-software stocks, which experienced their worst week on record to kick off November and have seen cold rain continue to fall amid a perceived slowdown in business spending after a wave of cloud adoption in the first two years of the pandemic. Early results from Atlassian Inc. TEAM and Twilio Inc. TWLO started the downfall, and recent earnings have not revived the sector.</p><p>Autodesk Inc. ADSK signaled a slowdown in business spending on Tuesday as executives trimmed their billings outlook for the year, leading Mizuho 's desk analyst Jordan Klein to conclude that the week after Thanksgiving could be the tipping point for software earnings.</p><p>\"I do not want to be overly dramatic here,\" Klein wrote in a Wednesday note, \"but after a very rough year,\" along with software lagging tech and the S&amp;P 500, \"the software sector feels poised to potentially roll over hard if a slew of key results next week are disappointing.\"</p><p>The slate of cloud-software companies reporting next week is long, and led by two of the biggest names in the sector: Cloud pioneer Salesforce.com Inc. CRM and hot young name Snowflake Inc. SNOW, which both report on Wednesday. They will be preceded by Intuit Inc. INTU, Workday Inc. WDAY, and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD on Tuesday, and joined Wednesday by Okta Inc. OKTA, Splunk Inc. SPLK, Nutanix Inc. NTNX, Box Inc. BOXand Yext Inc. YEXT Cloud-security name Zscaler Inc. ZS rounds out the week on Thursday along with Veeva Systems Inc. VEEVand UiPath Inc. PATH </p><p> Ticker  Expected report date  FactSet EPS consensus  FactSet revenue consensus  INTU    Tue., Nov. 29         $1.19                  $2.5 billion  WDAY    Tue., Nov. 29         84 cents               $1.59 billion  CRWD    Tue., Nov. 29         32 cents               $575.1 million  CRM     Wed., Nov. 30         $1.22                  $7.83 billion  SPLK    Wed., Nov. 30         25 cents               $847.5 million  OKTA    Wed., Nov. 30         (loss) 24 cents        $465.4 million  SNOW    Wed., Nov. 30         4 cents                $539.4 million  ZS      Thurs., Dec. 1        26 cents               $340.7 million</p><p>Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said Salesforce looks best-positioned this earnings season among cloud companies in that execs are under the gun to show better-than-feared demand, margin protection and efforts to derisk 2023.</p><p>\"With companies generally playing catch-up in regards to pushing the impacts of deteriorating macro conditions into 2H22 guidance, CY23 consensus estimates likely remain too high across many names, particularly given most 2023 guidance is still to come and customers' 2023 IT budgets are biased to be revised lower,\" Weiss said in a note.</p><p>Wood, however, notes that while his checks indicate demand for core products was \"constructive,\" those for products from acquisitions like Tableau, Slack and Mulesoft indicate demand was \"weaker.\"</p><p>Should next week turn sour, Klein sees Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Oracle Corp. ORCL as \"potential defensives,\" as he believes more money may migrate from software names into chipmakers' stock, which would be an about face from his call from five months ago, speculating if investors were taking money out of chips and putting it into software.</p><p>So far in November, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has gained 4.4%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP has advanced 3.1%, and the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV is up 0.9%, the Global X Cloud Computing ETF CLOU is down 1.3%, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY is off 3.2%, and the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD is down 7.6%.</p><p>This week in earnings</p><p>Salesforce is the only Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA component set to report this week, but nine S&amp;P 500 companies are on the docket. In addition to Intuit on Tuesday, NetApp Inc. NTAP and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. HPE are scheduled to report; Synopsys Inc. SNPSand Hormel Foods Corp. HRL will join Salesforce on Wednesday; and Kroger Co. KR, Dollar General Corp. DGand Ulta Beauty Inc. ULTAare scheduled for Thursday.</p><p>The numbers and calls to watch</p><p>The Black Friday wrapups: Early reports suggested not much growth from Black Friday sales a year ago, despite inflation pushing prices higher overall. Some retail companies will get the opportunity to discuss exactly how their early holiday sales went this week, with Ulta, Kroger and Dollar General being joined this week by the likes of Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. VSCO, Five Below Inc. FIVE, Big Lots Inc. BIG and Petco Health and Wellness Co. WOOF In addition, Costco Wholesale Corp. COST is expected to provide November sales data on Wednesday, ahead of full quarterly earnings a little more than a week later.</p><p>Cloud software is suffering a cold November rain.
