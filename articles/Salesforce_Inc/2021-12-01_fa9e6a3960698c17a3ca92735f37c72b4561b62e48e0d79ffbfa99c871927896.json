  "title": "Salesforce Needs to Keep Having It Both Ways; Cloud giant has sharpened its focus on profitability, but investors still want high growth numbers as well",
  "text": "<p>One might think Mr. Taylor was walking into a sweet gig. Salesforce shares have been on a tear of late, jumping 20% over the past six months and sharply outperforming cloud peers as the company's strong financial performance helped investors shake off worries about the nearly $28 billion acquisition of Slack Technologies that was announced a year ago. But the company's third-quarter results didn't shine quite as brightly, with billings coming in slightly below Wall Street's forecasts. Salesforce also projected revenue for the current quarter and the next one that was slightly below analysts' projections. The company's stock price slipped 6% following the results.</p><p>The reaction is a sign that investors are still adjusting to the new Salesforce. The company's long focus on rapid growth has created an enterprise software giant now generating nearly $25 billion in annual revenueâ€”a doubling in size in just three years. But investors seemed to tire of the growth-at-any-cost approach, as the company's string of major acquisitions often put the stock into a funk. A sharper focus on improving profitability has thus resonated. Salesforce shares had jumped 10% since the company told analysts in September that adjusted operating margins would hit a record 20% in its fiscal year ending January of 2023.</p><p>The company stuck by that goal on Tuesday, despite the slightly weaker revenue picture for the near term. Changes brought about by the pandemic have allowed Salesforce to boost its efficiency; less corporate travel plus the near disappearance of massive in-person events like the company's annual Dreamforce conference have helped sales and marketing expenses decline to 44% of revenue for the past nine months compared with the company's average of 46% over the previous three fiscal years. And management is clearly expecting those changes to stick. Mr. Taylor told analysts Tuesday that \"we all know we're not going to be in the office five days a week.\"</p><p>But Salesforce still has to close a lot of sales if it wants to reach its goal of surpassing $30 billion in annual revenue in the next fiscal year. The jury remains out on whether the company can keep up that pace without resorting to bigger and more expensive acquisitions. The new, more-profitable Salesforce seems to be a hit with investors. A slower-growing one probably won't be.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Salesforce Needs to Keep Having It Both Ways</p>",
