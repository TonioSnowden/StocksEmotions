And that is supporting the idea that the Fed could continue with this aggressive tightening path, which is probably why we're seeing stocks turned negative here,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in an interview.</p><p>St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, in a speech, warned that the Fed was in danger of losing control of how much inflation American households are expecting.</p><p>Bullard has previously said he would like to get the fed-funds rate up to 3.5% rate by the end of the year. If the Fed hikes interest rates by 50 basis points at both the June and July meeting, as most Fed officials support, the Fed's benchmark rate will be in a range of 1.75% to 2%.</p><p>Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Wednesday said the time to pause the rise in interest rates is when the Federal Reserve gets its benchmark policy interest rates up to about 2.5%.</p><p>Growing expectations the Fed will follow up widely expected half percentage point rate increases in June and July with another in September were blamed for weakness in stocks and bonds, which sent Treasury yields higher.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y note rose 8.2 basis points to 2.922% on Wednesday, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>As well, investors will be keeping an eye on the liquidity impact of shrinking of the Fed's massive balance sheet, which starts Wednesday and is aimed in part at helping fight high inflation.</p><p>\"Uncertainty over the impact of Fed QT that kicks off today and ramps up to full force over the next three months to a pace of $95 billion/month could also prove a factor weighing on sentiment,\" according to a note by Saxo Bank strategists.</p><p>Read: Fed's quantitative tightening is here: What that means for markets</p><p>Earnings reports after the market close Wednesday are expected from meme stock GameStop Corp.
